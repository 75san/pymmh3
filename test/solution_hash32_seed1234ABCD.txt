PREFACE
0xECEB1967

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x6883B97C
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x04B7F0AA
miscellaneous remark.
0x7E9425D5

0x3796A4AC
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x0A693896

0x3796A4AC
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0xFC3100BD
few pretensions.
0xA0CED8B2

0x3796A4AC
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x975BCA17
obscure aspirant.
0x41899899

0x3796A4AC
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x50618603
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x3BED9D19
Author.
0x77572A12

0x3796A4AC
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x0FDD72F9
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x67BE9058
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0x3455244B
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0xBBD3F4DC
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0xB235D553
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0xA04FFEBB

0x3796A4AC
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0xB01C5ADC
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0x8155AB42
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x200CD890
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x5F07782B
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0xB6B5A3C5
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x5CF797A8
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0xF390A7BA
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0x21E49DCB

0x3796A4AC
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x3D61B923
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0xF71BB029
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0xA920F4D7
Thorns.
0xB19DE60A

0x3796A4AC
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xAB2ED3F6
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x0A363F81
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x02EF9853
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xC27B4531
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0x1623F66E
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xEDE1BF44
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x2552A7D2

0x3796A4AC
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0xC085AAB4
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x07A6D134
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xDD73DC20
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0xC3ED7188
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0xE69D4AFF
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x37178B89

0x3796A4AC
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x7C2C063E
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x82747EEA
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xF06036E3
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x25331C66

0x3796A4AC
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x02FD99E4
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x1F88582D
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x66DED912
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x856CF13D
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0xB4CD734F
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x13A16940
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0xAD74AE58
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0xE992C7F3
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x85A3E327
Rimoth-Gilead.
0x42BB6433

0x3796A4AC
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x09B3441D
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x442E377D
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xCDC609E7
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xDBCC7146
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x353E233A
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0xCBAE218A
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0xDB212FF5
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x83401B48
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x5495E971
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x3759CB17
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0x4BC95AF8
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0xA2228A4C
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x1466E291
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xE4F26DFC
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0xEA606E4B

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x57A44335
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0xF3B90FCD
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x84C47997
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xF7E6043B
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0xFA5D9E5B
denied where it is justly due.
0x918BAE68

0x3796A4AC
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0x56ED7046
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0x594CDBF9

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0xA9F9EF77
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x705D9E7F
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0xB6AF8B43
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0xCB9C75C6
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xAB739CD3

0x3796A4AC
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xF43908E2
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0xAA163165
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0x2E9323BB
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x27414ACA
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0x2131D09F

0x3796A4AC
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x9C39F9E2
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xB8FFCAA5
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0xDA75C32C
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x0A997DA3
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0xE3BD689F
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xD8F085B0
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0xD4967041
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x23BFEA20
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0xB485EC9D
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0xDF183565
little children."
0x825D02E8

0x3796A4AC
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0xFB846469

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x71798809
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0x34B8BAF9
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0x83FF85E6

0x3796A4AC
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0xB60921A2
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xD3184DB8
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x2263C710
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x0863C167
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0x1B773FE9
retirement.
0x35D1977D

0x3796A4AC
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x89449E4F
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0xE9DFDE19
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xD530A90D
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0x07B2E627
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x4B7B9917
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x6E742B0B
lamentable blast.
0xB597E1B5

0x3796A4AC
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x2493EB8C
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x9AAC1AC6
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0xF8C5A74F
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x93ADBF1D
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x97980768
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0xD9ACCF14
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0x58CF5264

0x3796A4AC
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x069EF524
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x37DB928D
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0x86680EC8
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x1A65F879

0x3796A4AC
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0x2EABC470
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0xFC4CE21F
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x65CD87B4
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x7C29C919
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x90F79126
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x4EF74EE0
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0xA4EF323C
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x13F9EB1E
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0x71CE2DC0
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x0C3456ED
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x2FAEE85C
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0xBC5EFDCA
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x22018788

0x3796A4AC
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x72E2BA25
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x8A306F1C
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x534ED953
hour of eventide.
0x64550320

0x3796A4AC
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0x8B6D1F19

0x3796A4AC
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0xCB291D6D
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0xAD287B9D

0x3796A4AC
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x26B8EA24
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x5F830E1C

0x3796A4AC
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0xB7F17A12
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x4DA10644
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x6623369E
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x7EF90892
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x7987B6D7
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x76C69300
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0x906BDA91
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x2A86971C
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x27AAC478

0x3796A4AC
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x0FFADDED
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0xA9DDC4BD
room door opened.
0x73053A00

0x3796A4AC
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0x89B57477
found the room apparently empty.
0x665CFB69

0x3796A4AC
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x2AD45D3D
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x43A68D34
animal!"
0xA07327EB

0x3796A4AC
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x3B641E37
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x6977F9D8
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0xD0092AE1
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x5149B94A

0x3796A4AC
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x9125A930

0x3796A4AC
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x8A1E84E1
forth by the said Jack.
0x2F3BDCCF

0x3796A4AC
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0xC6DDE0B1

0x3796A4AC
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xD8E05720
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x075A16B4
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xA7195476

0x3796A4AC
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0xC6D2C7B5
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x29D5A156
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0xF7617370
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x1E565DF8
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x44400B0C
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0xA22A416E
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x8B9DFCA0
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x1463F3F6
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x28CC99A5
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0x9F54D799
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x1E0F5FCE
home.
0x67335B5B

0x3796A4AC
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0xFDD698E8
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0xC0D39786
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0xAC088AF2
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x2870885B
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x63B2A1ED
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0x7569ECC7
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xFAE8E4D2
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x3089D2E0
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x84290579
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x03C81669
her back.
0xC787B991

0x3796A4AC
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x07C6D4C9
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0xEA4DF3BE
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x5BCF5EC2
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0xAC785AC5
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x90DB2300
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x4AB992FF
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0xD6AC5D92
chair.
0xF693156F

0x3796A4AC
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0xCF9C5403
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x1DB0BDDE
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x65F23587

0x3796A4AC
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0xA43DC191
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x9D236170
insult.
0xD3E22870

0x3796A4AC
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0x5092FE10

0x3796A4AC
"I was reading."
0x8DE5CEFA

0x3796A4AC
"Show the book."
0xFE66FA2F

0x3796A4AC
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0x3525A04B

0x3796A4AC
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x17504233
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xA149A060
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0x5B74E16E
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0x06DC111A
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xDF5EEBA9
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0x09B94138
the mirror and the windows."
0xAC9ED868

0x3796A4AC
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0x64CDE3B1
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0xC2F4503C
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x054A0EE3
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0xE1786BA9
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0xFC5AE590
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0xE5F56ABA

0x3796A4AC
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x2C1EF92A
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x9047A412

0x3796A4AC
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0xF1E37E19
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0xCB8234FC
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0xA407E0D7

0x3796A4AC
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x6187CB6F
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0x1F053385

0x3796A4AC
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0x9C642F29
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x62506476
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x0BDE430C
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x085FEDDD
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0xC76CFF94
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0xA220B460
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x5C0B5E2B
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xBDF841D5
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x1863AA5B

0x3796A4AC
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0xF66AFCB6

0x3796A4AC
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x47599A06

0x3796A4AC
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x46B09EF1

0x3796A4AC
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x3B6CA7BC
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0xD11E4A0A

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER II
0x8EAA8891

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xCC5DCBC3
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x5F59FC36
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0xA4342C97
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x452D4A5A
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x40C059E8
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0xF0C4367E

0x3796A4AC
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x0172F3DC

0x3796A4AC
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x18CE4AC3
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x73B49213
young master."
0x11E3E4BF

0x3796A4AC
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x128F834E

0x3796A4AC
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x8334CA12
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x4A686DD3

0x3796A4AC
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x217DFDC1
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0x45813DAE
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x0C0322E8

0x3796A4AC
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x3878876A
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0xC3A7EE32

0x3796A4AC
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x71652A1D
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0xDC32FC96
little of the excitement out of me.
0x6CAB5830

0x3796A4AC
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x5F823DF4

0x3796A4AC
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0xDE1063ED

0x3796A4AC
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0xB71985EC
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0x5EDDFEC6
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0x0532363C
incredulous of my sanity.
0x205BF570

0x3796A4AC
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x8A341690

0x3796A4AC
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x9AEDED08
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0xE2BEAA1D
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0x62FE3BB2

0x3796A4AC
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0x6BD2171F
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xB267D1E4
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x85E3AB31

0x3796A4AC
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0xC4462D25
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xD5BA8A2B
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0xBB7D8A9A
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x534041A6

0x3796A4AC
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0xA5409BE7
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0xF7258AED
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0xF950FD79
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x6BFC358B
them."
0x4DE5328F

0x3796A4AC
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x89B0D682
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x22EB2835
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x41485A01
away, I am sure."
0x634C6A55

0x3796A4AC
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x7BFF495D
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xDF5C4A40
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x8CF7BF46
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0x26CDC10B
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x1C3FCCB4
fetch you away."
0x2AE079A0

0x3796A4AC
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0x486A4726

0x3796A4AC
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x688482D2
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0xC8169ACA
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0xF230C24C
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x21EDF122
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xA5F3667B
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x467C4DE8
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x7FA8B06F
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0xA4B09F90
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xD0187838
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x98A0C0BC
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0x3D2E7491
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0x74C929BA
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x341756B4
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x2382BA6D
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x2DCFC19D
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x2A3BDB6C

0x3796A4AC
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0xCFAB3846
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0xCE0FB5DE
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0xD4BA94A5
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0xBD5E1433
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x6A640F08
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x96DAE140
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0xD19454E0
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x229D1518
in spite of its grandeur.
0x92A9E01B

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0xA39C911C
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x9EB7EFD3
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x07F7123D
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xDFAB6364

0x3796A4AC
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0xA3AB028B
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0xE4D80926
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0x23CAD578
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0xE796F791
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0x5CA25B06
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xCAA1490A
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x8FCEB0E6
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x99BABA53
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xCA659BBC
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x8AEA6015
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xD49FF729
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0xCFA1981C
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x46CC3B86
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x14F8D7B1
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0xBB5D1D83
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x04448583

0x3796A4AC
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x76E08200
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x7F1D1E36
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0x6E4487B8
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x45263B81

0x3796A4AC
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xA9F807D2
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x5F1EBF78
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x75FD55B1
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x1258D25E
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0xC1CA305E
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0xDA730925
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x57E5C745
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x67734623
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x0586A63A
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x04FACD22
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x34F25C1D
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0xB7B57D83
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x2BF70029
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0xF5B86F3E
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x1F1F6E88
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0xBD8254E6
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x4A1CF56D
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x4FB8D124
night.
0xE63026C7

0x3796A4AC
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0xBD14118C
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0xA5C2F3E9
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x1BC9B51F
general opprobrium.
0x4CA2C790

0x3796A4AC
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0xED366B00
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x025815D6
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0xC66AE3AA
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0xF43C8070
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xDB4362BC

0x3796A4AC
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x78D87F02
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0x079FC451
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0xAAE977BF
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0xF2EA95F7
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0x67329A88

0x3796A4AC
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0xD696B28B
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xAAAA45B0
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0x2770E73F
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x087DBE6D
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x9C6D76B9
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x98EC66B0
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x8ADC0C5E
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x5B8D9BA9
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x58095093
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x1534DD0D
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0xF796F917
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x2951F616
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0x6A323678

0x3796A4AC
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x9E0C6DB3
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0xBA41913F
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0xFBDF7563
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x96C6FEDB
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0xE768627C
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0xE898103C
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x3DD81866
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0xF526E844
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x8E0BA923
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x34602288
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x39A43337
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0x275999CB
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0xB12B46AC
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x54D85A78
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x9420476B
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x347F7DAA
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0x9039BC48
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x855022AF
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x4F6E13DF
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xA50C0980
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x9D1E7F07
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x0E03368C

0x3796A4AC
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x4F061C49
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0xB46C1450
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0x72928085
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x2857DF72
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x21F3C9B4
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x79192BA5
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0xC36266BA
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x2677687C
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x299FE1A5
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0x3BECE2B1
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0xBF4027AC
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0xA947256D
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0x2A1FB874
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0xED62A2D1
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x4C5B6C0E
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x9EC01324
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xCFDEE0B9
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x07775E04
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x7D908672
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x8E844969
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x953A82F0
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0x34E47F95
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x22A8BD8A
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0xB2E58780
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x2523590B
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0xDD55DCA0
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x935447F2
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x3178EBD4
Abbot entered.
0xB9B59176

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x93DC6AB5

0x3796A4AC
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0x6EA47232

0x3796A4AC
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0x07D1BA66

0x3796A4AC
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0x0F1BFE66
Bessie.
0x1841D33F

0x3796A4AC
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x449CD978
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x0132EDA4

0x3796A4AC
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x8AF0F1C3
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0xCE20A964
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x4CC1F254

0x3796A4AC
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xAF2AB6CE
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x3F32F980
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x980C787E
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0xA5ECD48E

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0xA2DBC5CF

0x3796A4AC
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x494DECBF
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0xA64296EB
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x53178E7E
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x159DA700
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0xFEF76E9C
then."

0x3796A4AC
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xFF964159
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0xA1F2ACE5

0x3796A4AC
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0x6AC3C245
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0x55D8E08D
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0xF804DA88
duplicity.
0xC92ECCD6

0x3796A4AC
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x0D941DC7
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x829F9F25
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x7C81B278
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0xC6014256

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0x52C91D5F
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x476AA0FE
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0xBBDBE5FD
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x6DC258C1
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x8993C1A9
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x2FBC0E53
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x6BE8BE9D
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0x34CE1FDC
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xE4096CFA

0x3796A4AC
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x2AD73967
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0xBB88183A
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x6DB37F90
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x586F7FE9
pillow, leaning over me.
0x1D6F7767

0x3796A4AC
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xBA13BC94
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x715F57AD
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x8C8A2881
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x8C93242B
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x16F629A0
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x8D9D6211
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0xA6D5F0AD
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x36D284A4

0x3796A4AC
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0x64BE5F76

0x3796A4AC
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0x78EC876E
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0xCBD0E8B1
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xF3B2A441
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x1FAB2AE4
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x200C61BB
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x0BBFBE16
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0x1CB5D5DE
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0xA6095E27

0x3796A4AC
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x96B8D1E1

0x3796A4AC
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x1EF59381
rough.  "I will try."
0x149E75D7

0x3796A4AC
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x5BACA768

0x3796A4AC
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xEDDBD6BA

0x3796A4AC
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x63E89501
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x9BE6C8B5

0x3796A4AC
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0x400E68DB

0x3796A4AC
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x5C0637CC

0x3796A4AC
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0xA5DD9558
soon, no doubt."
0x86668208

0x3796A4AC
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0xE6D103D1
say--
0x46FB0C13

0x3796A4AC
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xCF980065
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0xA274E6BE
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x8BE3D185
rather too hard."
0x918DF342

0x3796A4AC
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0xA4F839B9
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x463FC2F9
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0x9CAD4B55
the main subject discussed.
0xBF8D6412

0x3796A4AC
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0xF3992327
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0xCB392BD5
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0xF90C6F71

0x3796A4AC
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0xF84D73E4
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x73CFED37
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0x74EF4472

0x3796A4AC
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xC992354C
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x505433E9
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xC73BA0BD
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x39BC0BE2
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x62CDEDA7
bad propensities.
0xB731259A

0x3796A4AC
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x82277F02
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x593EB05F
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xABCC7C48
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x74438C52
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0xCE0D6651
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x0A985F7D
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x71DDBA6A
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0x85B733DB
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0xE00000C5
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xAF15BD6B
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xE5867C96
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0xB35F9060
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0x6DA6F841

0x3796A4AC
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0xE5CB236D
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0xEA295113
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x9695CA4D
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0xEB4360EE
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0xCAF12B5F
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x4D8B1E58
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0x58D0E9E9
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x2B2098D7
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0x362CAADA
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xC97916D4
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x6AC5956D
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x586094D1
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x5ED53A36
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x3F2D30F2
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x803B6A7D
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0xE258D4E6
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0xA8687F08
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x01EB34EC
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0xED7B9FD9
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0xAD9E4F32
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0xF860C76A
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xE8511FEE
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0xC6AD5534
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x0961BD1B
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0xBDAC7172
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x9A3098FE
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0x7A1A9FE8
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x0D211730
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0x8CCA035E
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x7244FBD6
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0x258C2D60
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0xD90F615C
untasted tart.
0x8290B67E

0x3796A4AC
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x563B5E8B
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xAC4BF027
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0xF42A9A17
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x33CE34DA

0x3796A4AC
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x8CFB2255
      A long time ago."
0xABBB50FA

0x3796A4AC
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x5FBE2999
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x14D1D514
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x1D655417
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x23C5719F
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0x69C4F60F
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x634FF47C
one.
0x5DD29C7D

0x3796A4AC
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x53356ECD
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x2B22450F
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x35823D08
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0xC8B7FACC

0x3796A4AC
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0x173731CA
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0x69B10537
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x4404CDA9
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0xF253B0DE

0x3796A4AC
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x6812CBA6
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0x5B4B4A27
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xE097E6D0
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0xA6201818

0x3796A4AC
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x2BA5F0C2
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0xF7C15DA7
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x7537AB07
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0xBDF29924

0x3796A4AC
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0xADE3B2A2
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x4F6E22A0
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0xC7C67D8D
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0xF733803B

0x3796A4AC
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x43FCE24F
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0xDB0DD200
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x91EA5CD0
Lloyd came again.
0xABA91B0F

0x3796A4AC
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x8F7D3FF3
how is she?"
0xAE13B9F1

0x3796A4AC
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0x81F22EF0

0x3796A4AC
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x1BA7CC28
is Jane, is it not?"
0x61DB7CB9

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x1977CC3B

0x3796A4AC
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x2DA6EC41
Have you any pain?"
0x1C24815A

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0x3796A4AC
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x5B9D0978
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0x2E46FC4E

0x3796A4AC
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x1F1B6242

0x3796A4AC
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0xFEC027A8
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0xF0B437F3
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0x0085620E

0x3796A4AC
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0xDD1808FF

0x3796A4AC
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x666E8E04
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x9DE14B6F
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x699143D6
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xAF77141C
leisure, he said--
0x789BD749

0x3796A4AC
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0xF831636D

0x3796A4AC
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x8DF40046

0x3796A4AC
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0xA170622E
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x3C47DCB8

0x3796A4AC
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0xBB208E2E
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0xAFB7377C
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0x29CF2B54

0x3796A4AC
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0xAEE3A9F4
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0x0649908E
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x064C77F4

0x3796A4AC
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0x686E7D5F
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x84781590

0x3796A4AC
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x432C7F04
Bessie was gone.
0xC2FD5F05

0x3796A4AC
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0xC92BD33E

0x3796A4AC
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0x15760ADF

0x3796A4AC
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0x5C16EEAA

0x3796A4AC
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x7FD50E85
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x4CA161AF
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x74556EFB
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x4F84B0C6

0x3796A4AC
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0x137426D1
daylight?"
0x143B39F3

0x3796A4AC
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x608507D2
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0xDB7B82D7

0x3796A4AC
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0xC832CE2F

0x3796A4AC
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0x92DEA901
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0xFE3A2AF6
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xEDEE1763
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0x2926E84A
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x8DCFA226
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0xD9F3BE60
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x03158562

0x3796A4AC
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0xBBBC5434

0x3796A4AC
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x03A12201

0x3796A4AC
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x0A75D54F

0x3796A4AC
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x0B804457

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0x999C2BEC

0x3796A4AC
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xE85FB83E
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0xB4BB3798

0x3796A4AC
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x33988BF6
than a servant."
0x6E7E8B93

0x3796A4AC
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0xA51CCB17

0x3796A4AC
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0xF814086B
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0xFC378E64

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0xBB471962

0x3796A4AC
"I think not, sir."
0x3900DBB7

0x3796A4AC
"None belonging to your father?"
0x33C049A1

0x3796A4AC
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xBD95D862
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x6519BF91
them."
0x4DE5328F

0x3796A4AC
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x4DFC5F11

0x3796A4AC
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x3BC7E9B7
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0x69F7947E
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0xCD5D21D0
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x0E606D74
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x25EA7788

0x3796A4AC
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0xE222D9E2

0x3796A4AC
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x4771DF96

0x3796A4AC
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0xD8AC5C25
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x53B19202
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x0EF05D22
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x101FAD70
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0xEE3FC25B
the price of caste.
0x8D391DE3

0x3796A4AC
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x38304742

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0xF8BBC828
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x139DBCA5

0x3796A4AC
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x78F7F50A

0x3796A4AC
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x2C2D552A
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0x5304A1CB
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0xD23DE9AB
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0xE19E8D58
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x70521292
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xB2D6E166
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xBB1EA484
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0x8C186A39
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xC9FC8F32
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x2A5B8F3F
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x62535BE9
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0xFEF2FCB2
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x3035F2DD
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0xF959DDAA

0x3796A4AC
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0xF3FA74CF
musings.
0x9F012D91

0x3796A4AC
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0xD016A30C
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x6FEFF446
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x815354C3

0x3796A4AC
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x7DA59D81
the gravel-walk.
0xFA178A43

0x3796A4AC
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xC95E95E9
to her before I go."
0x1A8D57C8

0x3796A4AC
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x49DCF33C
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0x6B2EAD84
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x265E479B
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xE1AF3A4A
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0xF7298374
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x6718940A
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x050A35FE
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x62AE5A04
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x1F582E97
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x05005C68

0x3796A4AC
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0x4154A7F7
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xCF3C3F69
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0xE6680CB2
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0xDE749E3D
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x7E56C273
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0xEFA87CF4
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0xA8EE836F
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0xC0A15E73
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0x72057663
of each other.
0x57C0D898

0x3796A4AC
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x08BC2E0A
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x7A3FAB4C

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x267752B0
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0xBAAD59F9
little toad as that."
0x81B62BF6

0x3796A4AC
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0xCA7288BE
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x2AE97F6F

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0x7090C518
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0xA57AC0B3
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x04940959
rabbit for supper."
0xA314B05F

0x3796A4AC
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.

CHAPTER IV
0x301B5A2E

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0x086F9987
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x373030F3
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xF3FF598F
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x4576AA05
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x104F1AD6
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0x505B4FF3
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0xE628DFDB
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0x33230401
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x946E122E
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0xBBF3DFB4
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x9A7FF275
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x96D1C4C6
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x3348EBE9
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0xE2C2666B
and rooted aversion.
0x2878C669

0x3796A4AC
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0xFCED6D51
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0x177CE8B1
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0xCB17CAB3
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0xEA8DBF06
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0xE13C337A
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0xA46E85D9
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0x0B0AC8BD
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x6857EA77
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xAA4EEEB7
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0xA4BC9DCF
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xD4753D55
was stopped rather harshly--
0x76E08217

0x3796A4AC
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x3C21710C
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x5C5F1573
should associate with her."
0xB6793433

0x3796A4AC
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x9FE2E065
deliberating on my words--
0x5172BD54

0x3796A4AC
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0xA7D10E11

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0xBB225935
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0xB0993D5E
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x18E3503B
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0x712BC289
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0xD65C7739

0x3796A4AC
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x3A234F77
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x14B57307
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0xC30DE582
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x9E1AA2F1

0x3796A4AC
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0x7D9951D7
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x8EF90CD5
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0x6C1B938C
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x8DADBD54

0x3796A4AC
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0xDA41B860
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0xE961AEEF
wish me dead."
0x1D161CA9

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x4CA7FE32
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xFBBAB250
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0xCDD7401F
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0x02982FF7
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0xDA43D9F3
in my breast.
0x1C3BF2F8

0x3796A4AC
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x77E9A0AB
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x4599716E
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0x3A8BCD1E
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0xBB83BA2B
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xF7C72F1A
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0x0A0F24F3
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0xF0042CD7
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x6CCF3BB7
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0xD30B81D4
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xC507C0E7
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x61AFC316
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x90F10439
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0x944F7302
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0xF492D6E0
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x28635946
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0x9CD7716A
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0xAE71ACC6
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x1DC77998
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0xCAE08C78
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x9FBF2182
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0x713A63C4
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x4351D6CC
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x053A0E80
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0xF8F7E43C
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0xD5364904
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x734AD535
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x3652727B
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0x6DFC99C0
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0xB2C008AF
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0xFD64EEA3
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0x9B92B0CA
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0xF192B7AC
to be happy likewise.
0x3939CE2D

0x3796A4AC
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x2B44FEA1
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x8BF5D9CA
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x4E3C312B
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x12CF4717
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0xC61BB18E
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0xA496FA3C
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x4CE1AFFB
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x7D80DF3C
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0xB7E142D8
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xB230C5A4
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0xB09C80B6
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0x0CF6B555
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x09D7DD33
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xAF814A67
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0xF6FA0109
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x03B22049
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0xF1D1C19D
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0xF628D689
Gateshead Hall.
0xA697E4D0

0x3796A4AC
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xACC804B9
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0x3EF35A06
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0xB19C0EE3
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0xCC80E755
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x925FE188
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x9E73BB68
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0xB8E09FAF
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x3C4A9944
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xEA8081C8
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x3796FE3D
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x1C543BBC
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x8F6F5B2C
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xF6C08883
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0xFDBC3523
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0x1B9F6E23
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0x2D6C8FC9
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x8A4AD0B5
accuracy.
0x5F4239CC

0x3796A4AC
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x8F02C0CD
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x7CC960C5
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x1E5ECE16
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x2DDB42B8
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x13ECF199
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x8B3FBCB1
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x571E6703
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0x11F5AAA2
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x26FF7EDA
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x44B33B4B
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0xFB6C5BDA
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x11F75839
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0xB5AACFB4
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0x140026A4
frost.
0xD0756497

0x3796A4AC
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0x7015A17B
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0xC5CBB844
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xD5952BA6
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0x81B1FDEE
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0xCE304C94
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x61370416
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0xB049FC97
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x6E23DBB7
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0xCE2F4087
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0x37F6D6EC
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0xF42210E8
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x86A1324A
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xBA71F20F
nursery.
0xD22A18B4

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x322D209C
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x45432C88
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x46088F53
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0xBB90F8B9
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x4FAE80CF

0x3796A4AC
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x8F737A09

0x3796A4AC
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x9909A710
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0xB008F1F3
window for?"
0xB9C8D40C

0x3796A4AC
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x29BD9863
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0x6A2373C9
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0xE1F73D24
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x579D9490
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x861B1B2E
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0xB8A76CD6

0x3796A4AC
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0xBF19116A
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0x9AFC10E5
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x6AB3D868
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x0EE02798
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x3020F253
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0xCE0B2923

0x3796A4AC
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0x5917A8D5
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x48FF13F5
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0xF6C23903
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0xC7780C5A
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0xD7E16C8E
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0xEE8179D4

0x3796A4AC
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x05766890
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x0C454BA3
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x5A61D588
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x17033C19
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0xCD9E1620
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x1038A49D
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x5A4BA070
by way of capital.
0x8EF96657

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x4B434C0E
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x6DBE19E8
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0xC49DBEC4
you."
0x50AAC609

0x3796A4AC
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x5C90E3F8
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0xFA187E56
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x1C56B383
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x10D9D9F3

0x3796A4AC
"Ten years."
0x3F2B2277

0x3796A4AC
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x04266DC8
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x72408A6D

0x3796A4AC
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x37CA7089

0x3796A4AC
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0xCF4FA5DF
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0xF3977B7B
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0xA4A6681F

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x97AF4DE4

0x3796A4AC
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x76A65D74
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x9875E261
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x02E39D51
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xC308E34A

0x3796A4AC
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x6F18A75D
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x755492AA
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x62F51272

0x3796A4AC
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x8DA96C7D
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x466E59B4
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x8F028702

0x3796A4AC
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x8061CBEC
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x250D274A

0x3796A4AC
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0xDB7D51E4

0x3796A4AC
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x74E52538

0x3796A4AC
"A pit full of fire."
0xAB887F5B

0x3796A4AC
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x4C820E40
ever?"
0x8C0341D6

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0x3796A4AC
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x6681E577

0x3796A4AC
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x24040FF7
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xD80AD3E3

0x3796A4AC
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xBC09B66C
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x2596DD80
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x4798A1D7
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x7DAA6094

0x3796A4AC
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0xBDE7DE03
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0xB2ED97C5
enough away.
0x0AB69CFE

0x3796A4AC
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x416311C0
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x24EBD444

0x3796A4AC
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x60A5BFF3
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x059C38F4

0x3796A4AC
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x54DDD6F5

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Do you read your Bible?"
0xD3689017

0x3796A4AC
"Sometimes."
0x8BD3B912

0x3796A4AC
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x2B721691

0x3796A4AC
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xE8F842BB
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xE22990E8
and Jonah."
0x5B2D5DED

0x3796A4AC
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x4B4B3F78

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0x3796A4AC
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x412BD667
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0xAA70CBEA
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x01752830
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x820FD614
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0xB9C23FD2
piety."
0xDB42032F

0x3796A4AC
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0xC16E2EC0

0x3796A4AC
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x3A1E51E3
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x53C80779
give you a heart of flesh."
0xAE5FE727

0x3796A4AC
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x1092E5A1
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0xC952FCD3
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0x7105A4EC
conversation herself.
0x707609D7

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x79123EBB
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0xC4AE39E0
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0xA49C5CC7
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xA3BBE2B5
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0xC356717E
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0x1741A452
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x1107E34C

0x3796A4AC
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x25966EA8
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x7EB8F79D
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0x95A73993
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xF0E40CBB
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0x1104A008
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0xBC86E9E1
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x7D49C4B4
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x91694B35
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0x895AA424
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xD123661C

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x19813B43
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x80D1E96C

0x3796A4AC
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0x16F6340A
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0x1A88717C
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0xB7CC203F
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x51D421AF

0x3796A4AC
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0x11AA1222
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x5F7A7064
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0xBBE387D2
Lowood."
0x6FB01D84

0x3796A4AC
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x3E3D0175
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x5566C55B
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x4A23AFDC
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0xF5EF2770
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xAF1DC177
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0x193D8D46
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0xA32001CC
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x1F833E78
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x0161ECEE
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0xC7B16FB0
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x9B733C9E
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x9EAE78ED

0x3796A4AC
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x4693B609
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xF2AC73B9
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0xA91BA5B7
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0xB3BBDE53

0x3796A4AC
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0x156689AD
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0x54CE5D5E
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0xC37CD3EE
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0x2AC268F4
inhabitants."
0x30BCFA3F

0x3796A4AC
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x3DC236BD
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0xC9DA834E
and prospects?"
0x02E926BB

0x3796A4AC
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x82009B3E
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0x6E5C88F9
of her election."
0xBF5D5B21

0x3796A4AC
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x0F25D7B3
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x60BA6B31
becoming too irksome."
0x849B8205

0x3796A4AC
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0x2A631C21
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0xCD0DAF83
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0xF0A377F7
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0xAAB8303A
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x851F1DA9

0x3796A4AC
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x6DC0FADD
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x00893853

0x3796A4AC
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0xBA89F063
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x93879286
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0xCF988385
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x3D014BBB

0x3796A4AC
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0xE2AB4571
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xC42F9CE5

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0xEED3EA1E
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x02F48155
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x72058540
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0xB391B30D
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x799E3F0F
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x0D4E067C
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x0DF99F73
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x6F032C85
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0xC5DD3D46
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0xECB8197A
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x05FC3106
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x99D5144A
handsome attire.
0x9666AE28

0x3796A4AC
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xA50123D1
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0xE3A5DB61
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0xDF15808A
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x01E3F468
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0xCA938239
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0xB72B2A52
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x7CEEEA87
fomented now within me.
0x3C06A4A8

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x3B52A25F
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x9D219096

0x3796A4AC
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0xE239AA9B
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x8348329B
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0xA6219160
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0x5C76401A
to her.
0xD283BA26

0x3796A4AC
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0xE4C61386
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x3E1F0877
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x6587D9A6

0x3796A4AC
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x75B5F2C4
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0xDB479BCA
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x6374AC75
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0xDD937670

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0xDBA53026
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0x63301613

0x3796A4AC
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0x1DA9AEAC
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0xBC4B5EBE
used to a child.
0x90F21073

0x3796A4AC
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0xEE0AAB7B
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x09F728BE

0x3796A4AC
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x5C580896
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x2C2D6A5D
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x4E1AE73C
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0xF4E6B9A4
miserable cruelty."
0xAEA4D9B6

0x3796A4AC
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x5D1F7AB4

0x3796A4AC
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x199C528C
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x76275148
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x387764EA
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xE30D2D5D
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x3FD2F411
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x5D8D03F8
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0xD433BB6D
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0xBE7A0C0E
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x2AB7E8A1
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0xA1C87112

0x3796A4AC
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xE3DD41D2

0x3796A4AC
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0x1F8A84D7
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x91A881F2
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x416DAF49
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x8E69C007
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0xD582B5F7
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x22A868CF
would cry.
0xDCCA2660

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0xF3E35AEC
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x8FCB21EB

0x3796A4AC
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x63D2D985

0x3796A4AC
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x5462DDB2
your friend."
0x4F4A3791

0x3796A4AC
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0x99A74654
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xE5F470A7
you have done."
0xE02CA861

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x5FAB09FE
their faults."
0x9AFC5049

0x3796A4AC
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x52B3B087

0x3796A4AC
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x8A9FCD89
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0xFF12B72A

0x3796A4AC
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0xCF7EB714
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xBFB963C8

0x3796A4AC
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x09CD497C
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0xFB4235EB

0x3796A4AC
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x017A0A66
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0x7848A5A0
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x23115073
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0xDE2A7C20
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0xFC904EAF
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xE31B5037
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0xEDFF4AF0
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0x8981F698
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0xAFA3604A
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x8C36432D
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0xC5B35D65
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0xD3DE9B1F
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0xC061E133
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x76E62250

0x3796A4AC
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x76E7921F
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0x36E3FF9E
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x13238500
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0xFCA74D14
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x5B499E88
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x8838CECC
of my nature.
0x4CB768C4

0x3796A4AC
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x7FCF16BC
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x82F4E988
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0xE3EF1596
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x5E20973C
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x95BFB785
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xC719CEFA
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0xF6125B3E
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0xC85D8080
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x9DE0E4D4
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0xD9F6E681
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0xCFA61B45
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xC6DA43B1
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x46D7F4BF
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x5ED8D260
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0x3B629E24
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x650030FE
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x282DB0F1
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x1DE9C239

0x3796A4AC
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0x8BE0B391
to lunch!"
0xC40E23C9

0x3796A4AC
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xC18FA210
came tripping down the path.
0x0659A800

0x3796A4AC
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x7038C158
called?"
0x67B92153

0x3796A4AC
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0xE6210944
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x48F0F48C
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0xD6D2CB93
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x306B06DA
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x682B528A
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0xA51555C6

0x3796A4AC
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0xD665E33A
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0x1E631018

0x3796A4AC
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0xC6681C92
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x81523013
suppose?"
0x276AD4F1

0x3796A4AC
I nodded.
0x8411169C

0x3796A4AC
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x4E4676F6

0x3796A4AC
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x90F2B1A2

0x3796A4AC
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0xC1D94261
be bolder."
0x0B69769B

0x3796A4AC
"What! to get more knocks?"
0xDA69F7C6

0x3796A4AC
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x3FC5F9B4
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x4A38638B
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x25612E11
for you."
0x89285C69

0x3796A4AC
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0xED3E2D92

0x3796A4AC
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x93434F00
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x0064C806
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xBDC79653
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xC907C6E2
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x87798C66
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x325B0314

0x3796A4AC
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0xF13D0EC5

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x9B3B772E
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x6D83C1AA
provoking."
0x63D99E64

0x3796A4AC
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0xC1E6501D
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x25188644
dread."
0xC7F19EFC

0x3796A4AC
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x3581E12C

0x3796A4AC
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x15ADB5D0

0x3796A4AC
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0xB074D114
others."
0xB1810A3A

0x3796A4AC
"You don't show it."
0x5AC9D550

0x3796A4AC
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0x19B9DE77
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x70C1292F

0x3796A4AC
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x196739D4
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x57F3FE0A
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0xDE5A3631

0x3796A4AC
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0xBFB54E47

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0xC5D297B9

0x3796A4AC
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x2B764B6B
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0x4814C2CC
you'd _rather_ not."
0xB73E2DE6

0x3796A4AC
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0xFEDF7280
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x0296B397
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xCB941D6B
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x318A60FE
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0x90714FE3

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER V
0x4F5B50B9

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0xDAAA80C4
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0xC33E2852
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x1173513F
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0x065AFA06
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xDEDFDBFD
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x191DD7D8
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0xD469416A
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0xCE4FA6D8
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xC77E9397
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0xADE00B56
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xF8B567E0
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0xFAD178B8
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xA625CE64
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0xB5CA1ABE
bye?"
0xEBF6FDAA

0x3796A4AC
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x5D6EAA72
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x9CDFB856
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x0DEF543D
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x6FF73F32

0x3796A4AC
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x79D797DE

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0xD823AD98
the wall."
0x785C6DD5

0x3796A4AC
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0xB76C7FD0

0x3796A4AC
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x574A5B07
been my foe."
0x03A1F0FB

0x3796A4AC
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xD38DDBB7

0x3796A4AC
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xD122034F
out at the front door.
0xE0695840

0x3796A4AC
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0xD348BBB3
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x7FCE8F02
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0x8E184944
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0xCC46CA81
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x893FF2C9
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0xA2BD60D2
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0x612FEA80
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xBA1431B1
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x788CB4D1

0x3796A4AC
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x579B5C4D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"And how far is it?"
0xFF2E0964

0x3796A4AC
"Fifty miles."
0x87FA551C

0x3796A4AC
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x49EEECD8
alone."
0xD3D62EC4

0x3796A4AC
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0x325A42DD
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x7C58D4EF
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0xB4517252
with kisses.
0x758A3F37

0x3796A4AC
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x30A66261
me into the inside.
0x396119C2

0x3796A4AC
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xB6778DB5
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0xE295D2DD
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x60E2ED6F
mysterious regions.
0xF9135266

0x3796A4AC
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x9DBAEB74
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0xC4EC44F2
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0xF28E5E0E
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xD122A0C7
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0xF2E3B7F6
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x196FA23D
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0x702E5AD6
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x8445CDFF
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0xE240810A
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x40446F58
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x36740F16
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0x3D34BE8C
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0xE1F84A22
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0xBA6202C6
"stony street" of L-.
0x147D61E8

0x3796A4AC
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x826C33BA
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x47F4723F
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x9334FB67
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0x8D3C88FA
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x3C693265
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x4933A352

0x3796A4AC
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0xCC8FAC0D
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x31E78240
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x10A6E253
by the light of the lamps.
0x3FB643C6

0x3796A4AC
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0xA9CE015B
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x4ACDC83B
instantly drove away.
0x423634E1

0x3796A4AC
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x1F172858
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x18E6BCA6
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x1EFF9AEC
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x198507C4
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x021504AE
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x8FBFC310
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xD8E65D3B
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x74CB42D8
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x5DDA57B5

0x3796A4AC
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0xAC0CB334
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xD3889A9C
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x235E9FE9
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x983A75BE
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x625A291F
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x47340900
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0xBAF2D19B

0x3796A4AC
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0x6E56A99E
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0x8EA5D062
grave, her bearing erect.
0x93F07BBB

0x3796A4AC
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0x430ED79F
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x390428AD
then further added--
0x9CE485E3

0x3796A4AC
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xC7DBABCC
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x82471685

0x3796A4AC
"A little, ma'am."
0xF421C945

0x3796A4AC
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x873B59FC
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0xED1FD5C5
come to school, my little girl?"
0x6E789311

0x3796A4AC
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x825309F2
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x127D9EC0
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0xFA9BF193
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0xC66C54E3
me along with Miss Miller.
0x4704E0A3

0x3796A4AC
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x36359E89
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0xB9662511
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0xF0045E0D
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0xCBE3E2F5
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0xC8DEB1B4
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xAE528D2F
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0xA429A515
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x51452B12
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0xB6BF240B
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x3116097E
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x73AC62FD
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0xC037723B
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x54B5F296
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x09569144
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0xA0B0F3EC
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x43F16FEE
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x72FCAF58
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0xE4723BA2

0x3796A4AC
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0xF9646D55
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0xE3A230D3

0x3796A4AC
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0x85ACAD6C

0x3796A4AC
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xB50B78CA
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0xAF62143F

0x3796A4AC
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0xFB3A68E0

0x3796A4AC
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0xC04B9F2F
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x1B90E2FB
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xEAE439C9
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0xBBCE7A75
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x9D0B9B0E
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0xC34C30DE
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x392078E9

0x3796A4AC
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x91CE94CE
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x3EED32D1
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0x4E2D6CC1
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x28E41ADB
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x2B2EBB7B
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x12C5CE31
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x95D97222
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x7F92A326

0x3796A4AC
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0xF56DE9CC
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0xF01683D7
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x87CB2ECB
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x2D0D1250
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0xEC89E942
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x437A0EA6
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x7F1C03D2
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x7F85E3A5
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x59C3CFE5
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x2C8B3AC9
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x7CC57472
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x4A8D8144

0x3796A4AC
"Form classes!"
0xD9193263

0x3796A4AC
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0x0FA75871
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x34741C1E
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0xDC114194
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xABE2585A
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0xA8D270B4
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0x67DE75CB
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x40ED9ACD

0x3796A4AC
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x007BCDB4
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x1EB90C30
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0xBDCD204C
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0x83BD4C59
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x2065D946

0x3796A4AC
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x8F50DC72
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0xAFDFDB6F
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x66974DB5
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0xD8B25EDD
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x2475EEDB
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0x656C4EEB
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x89165563
little the day before.
0x9A6587CB

0x3796A4AC
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x0F3CCF7D
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0xBA1DE9DB
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0x0063355C
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0xB2EB95F7
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x29A9B650
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x4893FDBB

0x3796A4AC
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x29DFD2B8

0x3796A4AC
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0xE9162104
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x68FFA33D
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0x0DBD65CA
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x13AFF96D
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x93793E4C
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x79D67FF6
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0xAC7B92B2
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x10994DBA
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x4090931B
the meal began.
0x609DF755

0x3796A4AC
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0x344D6D0F
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0xB4C97880
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0xF0360B30
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0xF99ABCC5
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xF0B12A6A
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x761BDF31
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0xAC85BB5A
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xD513A1F2
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0xC4D3EECE
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x83101ACE
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0xE7AB1A87
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x18FB57E4

0x3796A4AC
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0xADF8F994

0x3796A4AC
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x17A3040A
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x576B4B33
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0x4CB306DC
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0xC9176F0C
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0xA25C9421
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0x747D8CC1
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0x5419865A
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x3C0FCD77
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x8B2562DF
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x56F51C07

0x3796A4AC
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x4B91E18D
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0xE2384297

0x3796A4AC
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x1B7C7382

0x3796A4AC
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xFBF40B91
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x71F13553
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x62336A37
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0xB3A9026C
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x1F0C3DFC
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0xA2472724
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0x5E5A4433
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0xB93675D5
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0x302EF08F
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x6B1235DE
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0x04D2DED2
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xB8B36CE9
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x87474576

0x3796A4AC
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x4F6F374F
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0xA4177009
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x34B6F347
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x7C1A494C
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x666419A2
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x7BC03E87

0x3796A4AC
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x8A5EF2F6
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x47788AB1
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x92CF1160
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x7A6E470C
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0xD3C4ADEE
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0xBE541AAB
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0xCCD9D646
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x00F14233

0x3796A4AC
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x0E93AC92

0x3796A4AC
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x383C9F23
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xDD76B380
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x45BA0738
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0x788EA528
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0x88455CAB
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xBB1DE484
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x0EAA2EAF
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x6E208053
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0xD40B466C
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0xFD915985
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x5495EA1A
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0x4235D37B
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0x2B0BD621
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x3C6427D6
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0xD826ED8F
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x789D863A

0x3796A4AC
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x18AE2BDC
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0xB4EDFB70
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0xCEC0A2C3
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x075292A3
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0xCC76FF68
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x687409CE
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xE20F999E
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x3C8FCF38

0x3796A4AC
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0x251F37A8

0x3796A4AC
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x4C0D51F9
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0xFAB4236E

0x3796A4AC
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x02E998ED
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0xA647CDF6
to all."
0x90B5AA79

0x3796A4AC
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x2042741F

0x3796A4AC
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x10B1AC33
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0x4D14A763

0x3796A4AC
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x08B15795
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0xBAC3F670
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x1D33E41C
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0xE8919EFA
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x46A1382C

0x3796A4AC
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x5F202CEA
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x411548F2
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0xE0E9BAAB
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0xAF1C1BE8
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0xA974D759
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0xE59AD39B
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0x5EDEBAB5
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x66FEBB4A
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xB440F4C4
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x79C33B50
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xFAA3F3D6
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x2A154B17
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0xADDE994D
hollow cough.
0xCBD8383B

0x3796A4AC
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x09C90BE8
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0xA1CC4E7C
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0xB4FFE3CC
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0xB6160197
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xCD24D24B
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0xD13B288E
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0xE3AAF38D
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0xFCDD25AC
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x8F05D437
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x1D17323A
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0x60E0C76E
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x0A9AA08E
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xC886469D
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0x6EB35605
this inscription:--
0x89C3156E

0x3796A4AC
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0xA4B9C4A1
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x4A8B4A5A
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x51AB03B8
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x61FF9AA9

0x3796A4AC
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0xC620640F
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0xA3073FAD
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0xBFA14E55
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0x6D463860
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0xC2F1A174
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x1551821A
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x9E2940C0
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0xA843F294
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x4218C861
I said to her directly--
0x940F167A

0x3796A4AC
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0xE42F143D
her to lend it to me some day.
0xADFC06D8

0x3796A4AC
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x691475EA
she examined me.
0x2A2A750D

0x3796A4AC
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0xF51BD90D
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0xDED5E5EE
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x01F0831C
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x717297A9
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x0C8E0CEA
or substantial.
0x085A36F1

0x3796A4AC
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x699A71BD

0x3796A4AC
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0xA9CBFBAF
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0xB8E6569D
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x19CA1F2C
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x5809F7C7
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x866EC2D1
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0x5B12F79C

0x3796A4AC
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0xF51CE270
is Lowood Institution?"
0x44A29B9D

0x3796A4AC
"This house where you are come to live."
0x9792E963

0x3796A4AC
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0xEA182E9A
other schools?"
0x4485B8A7

0x3796A4AC
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0xE56FAD90
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x128A69AC
father or your mother dead?"
0x67F27A25

0x3796A4AC
"Both died before I can remember."
0x904ADD49

0x3796A4AC
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0x68D9161F
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0xF97BE870

0x3796A4AC
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0x7B4DE605

0x3796A4AC
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0x523FAB0F

0x3796A4AC
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0x88FB0711

0x3796A4AC
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0x9D2462FB
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0x018CD4AA

0x3796A4AC
"Who subscribes?"
0x3250F74C

0x3796A4AC
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0xE78E18FF
and in London."
0xFCA7283F

0x3796A4AC
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0x13AFCADE

0x3796A4AC
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0xE4BECF2E
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0x0F0CEFED

0x3796A4AC
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0x3796A4AC
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x8704E580

0x3796A4AC
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x2B39012A
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0x93C51B51

0x3796A4AC
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0xFD92501D
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x53851C00
all our clothes."
0xB2204184

0x3796A4AC
"Does he live here?"
0x426999C3

0x3796A4AC
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0x761B106F

0x3796A4AC
"Is he a good man?"
0x46E73F8D

0x3796A4AC
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0xA7171017

0x3796A4AC
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0x0307AA94

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0x327F2966

0x3796A4AC
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0x490A3EE9
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0xFD8CB35A
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0xD0FDB5D2
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0x553B447D
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0xAA416175
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0x8FB0D85E
teaches French."
0x88C8159A

0x3796A4AC
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x1E7359DF

0x3796A4AC
"Well enough."
0x791497B8

0x3796A4AC
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x97D8E70F
pronounce her name as you do."
0xDA50DEF8

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0xF41A9283
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0x4DC97F04

0x3796A4AC
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0xCEE7161A

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0xBECD9E52
she knows far more than they do."
0xB4FEA45F

0x3796A4AC
"Have you been long here?"
0x4B63D4EE

0x3796A4AC
"Two years."
0xD53359B5

0x3796A4AC
"Are you an orphan?"
0x281CB44C

0x3796A4AC
"My mother is dead."
0x8E18858A

0x3796A4AC
"Are you happy here?"
0x0C840F13

0x3796A4AC
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x40F5B92C
the present: now I want to read."
0x746DC08B

0x3796A4AC
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xC1E11FB6
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x1C42FE93
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0x618825D5
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x938A05F4
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0xA1AB6FFB
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0x7BBA224C
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x179871F4
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0xFCEFBDC9
day's fare would be like this.
0x60564267

0x3796A4AC
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x0DA79437
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x94A95047

0x3796A4AC
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0xAEE36CFF
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x90AB420F
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x99ED89F6
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0xA3A953C2
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x4EE29A44
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0xA6523508
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x37C46394
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0x3E77DEDE
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x8ECC0264
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0xD6B46BE6
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x0645301C
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x5AC0E645
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0x64CE1AA6
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x7957B702
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x5E0D7127
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xCFE595B3

0x3796A4AC
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xDA58BC2E
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0x5BB48706
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0xF31D1960
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x55F13489
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0xBE64BFC7
first day at Lowood.
0x95037CF9

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER VI
0xB0610EC5

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0xD5AB2C09
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0x5B23BC5A
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0x35C88E5E
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x7DA6129D
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x587EFAB0
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xB7253CC4

0x3796A4AC
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x9C295322
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0xC3A0AB9D
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0xFEA7C800
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0xAC0661BF

0x3796A4AC
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0xBE06A320
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0xB6AE4556
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x7B060A85
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xAA3DBB3D
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x931ED28A
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x7924C27E
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0xFCD02103
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0xF336B0CD
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0xC789601F
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x927E1EF8
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x98F553D4
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x8FB06E91
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0x597B339C
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x532AB3EF
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x6BD881B8
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x443AD5BE
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xABD9CC08
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x63431493
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x7C6ABBCD
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x6C781E84

0x3796A4AC
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0xC59FEA1E
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0x873D33F5
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x7F4F7914
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0xB914AF1C
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x4222F464
&c. &c.
0x909221BB

0x3796A4AC
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0xD82A94AA
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0xA64E16BC
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0x4435DD4C
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0xD2D450DE
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x8F9FBB07
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0x170E7F48
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0x3CF42845
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0xC585AD82

0x3796A4AC
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x93A6BBEC
morning!"
0x53AEAECC

0x3796A4AC
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x2FF8B321
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x95F542D4
as the water was frozen?"
0x34CC4E3B

0x3796A4AC
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xF264CDF8
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x7CF9D372
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0x0758AE2E
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x8F54E9A5
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x3366AB89
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0x61A41BF9
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x4B3407C0
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x266E4B01
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0x9B1AFED7
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xC2E81616
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xF9D79627
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0x666317D0
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x5238D947
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x6336EB3F
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0xCEAB9D52
altered its ordinary expression.
0xB1536028

0x3796A4AC
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x76175CF0
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0xCA0FDCA7

0x3796A4AC
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x9C3D2B35
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x52843B18
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0xD4070612

0x3796A4AC
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x7755E487
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0xBC74D95C
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0xE2E119BA
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x39A1861C
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x5A38A744
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x4A737C7B
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x1590F066
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0x33D2FF2C

0x3796A4AC
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x9EF12A49
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x49AFD63C
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0xDED91F9E
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x8AA888ED
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0x4D5C01A8
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0xCC85ACE0
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x1E43A5A7

0x3796A4AC
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x295634A2
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0xBB26557E
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0xB1C6D36C
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x17166C8B
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x17BC0190
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xBB341FC4
to clamour.
0xF6A9C217

0x3796A4AC
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x91A230C1
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x3BE71469
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x6EB2EF7F
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0x7717E339

0x3796A4AC
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0xD4E50851

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x99469F9D

0x3796A4AC
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x2F375C70
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x4152E44C
floor.
0xAA8C60AF

0x3796A4AC
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x5815AB5C

0x3796A4AC
"Helen."
0xEC311C49

0x3796A4AC
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x062B96D5

0x3796A4AC
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x4964FDC5

0x3796A4AC
"Will you ever go back?"
0x5F82DD6E

0x3796A4AC
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x3A2216C7

0x3796A4AC
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x861440A5

0x3796A4AC
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x052EA46E
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x3B20D5EA

0x3796A4AC
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0xC805076D

0x3796A4AC
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x66ECE646

0x3796A4AC
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0xDBC7FC2C
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x70F2D1B4
break it under her nose."
0x55BA28CF

0x3796A4AC
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0xA482780B
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x02D627D0
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0xDCC2994E
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0xC9F41B28
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0xBC114766
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0x13B377A6

0x3796A4AC
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0x9B2527EB
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0xCE11D1B2
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0xEEDED323

0x3796A4AC
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0xEEDA75CF
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x09F7AA9D
required to bear."
0x2A00C579

0x3796A4AC
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0x3510FA27
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x110BF285
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0xD726526B
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x7D3422C9
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0xC7627721
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x53876B5B

0x3796A4AC
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0xF709F4B2
good."
0x6886D534

0x3796A4AC
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x056FB033
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0xD6EE73DB
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0x4F30BF05
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x9B901D5C
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x7386CD53
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0x8EB335D3

0x3796A4AC
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0x144B8F9E
addition: she kept silence.
0x1FBA248A

0x3796A4AC
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x3A16FDBB

0x3796A4AC
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x7A10222A
grave face.
0xE259D56A

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x174F5F82
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x7A545AD2
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0xF77F6ECA
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0xAA30D448
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0x61BA9E6C
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0xA3D6FE28
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0x947320B1

0x3796A4AC
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0xF5B59679

0x3796A4AC
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0x3729695A
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0x0DFDA19B
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0x2C3CE3CC
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x9C0C55D9
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0x4ABBBA41
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x63D0D0F4
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xB074FFED
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x13B525BA
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0x5BCC76E3
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x9631EB81
answer ready."
0xD8A32658

0x3796A4AC
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x2D7C1CF0

0x3796A4AC
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xE2F8C511
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x61084C98
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x05A94ED4
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0xE990EA9C
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0xD5669608
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x88F65E76
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0xE6669271
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0x98A42DB7
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x854DEF8B
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0xEEAF6D16

0x3796A4AC
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0x70D40FEB
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x9A926D99
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x9A11595D

0x3796A4AC
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0xD9F181EB

0x3796A4AC
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0xF16B4C75
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x54232EED
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x75654F1D
I wished to gain."
0xEDC8CB0A

0x3796A4AC
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0x1B89CD8B

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0xAA10AD2B
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0x4672D8A2

0x3796A4AC
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0xA21917DB
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0xD840B92A
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x025A692A
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xE0135E6D
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x55D71AB4
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0xAE5F7607
person who struck us never to do it again."
0xC25E7DE8

0x3796A4AC
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0x972E23D7
but a little untaught girl."
0xAD96D5B8

0x3796A4AC
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x13D76328
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0x926ED49D
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0x37329361
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0x6E39AE98

0x3796A4AC
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0xA9E1C732
civilised nations disown it."
0x993B3BDF

0x3796A4AC
"How?  I don't understand."
0x78AF53B3

0x3796A4AC
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0xC4836338
certainly heals injury."
0x5457973A

0x3796A4AC
"What then?"
0x44D8C603

0x3796A4AC
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0xBE8E2C94
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0xA7C14F76

0x3796A4AC
"What does He say?"
0x84CC5714

0x3796A4AC
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0x4C521B71
you and despitefully use you."
0x751F746D

0x3796A4AC
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0x3717E759
John, which is impossible."
0x3C3FA44A

0x3796A4AC
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0x002D048A
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0x210EA8A7
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x465B1403
softening.
0xF0C48CD9

0x3796A4AC
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0xAD561CF1
remark, but she said nothing.
0x2EA5496A

0x3796A4AC
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0x1D22B3CA
woman?"
0xA7FEDBDA

0x3796A4AC
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0xBF5A9F83
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x59EF8BF2
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x4C10971E
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x848F8C8E
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0xD8EA24CF
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0x12D7F55F
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0xDF07B20C
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0xD21B7F99
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0xA01F18C3
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0x10A716A5
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0xB42C3BD2
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x16D4F1A0
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x50023F53
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x6F093826
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0xAA976A53
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0xC5D28051
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xEF8904AA
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x2BA02B95
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0xB6A8BA40
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xA6F74B96
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0x31AF55B0
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x6BAFD57B
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0x92C66907
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x421A9547
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x10C45751

0x3796A4AC
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0x954D0F33
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xCC6D4904
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0xFF06471B
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x0F715516
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0x7F29115F

0x3796A4AC
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0xF90430DF
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0xF4D4CF7B

0x3796A4AC
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x1DDF9719
without reply as without delay.
0xE550DE79

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER VII
0x5740ADE2

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x338C1046
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x994C2A74
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0xE165D846
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x4EFA572C
were no trifles.
0x2F2B9567

0x3796A4AC
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0xD6FA6E7C
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0xD84FDECD
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x3AA57FEE
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x43D0F7D9
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x29ED9C15
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0xC6DE40A7
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x0483F10A
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0xC7F54F9C
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0xFA40C908
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0xE9501291
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0x35A85325
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0xD8DC9399
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x9D365303
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x9EAFA74B
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xBDA75FE2
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x1B6BEB39
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x1D38C5A4
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0xE62D9416
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x23357608

0x3796A4AC
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x569B3EB6
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0x71ACB3E7
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x94AFF1F7
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x6141C117
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x9C7894A8
meals, was served round between the services.
0x835C99A6

0x3796A4AC
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0xC6BD85C8
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0x46BE5AF2
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x770942AA

0x3796A4AC
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x2BE0AD1E
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0xF7BAFBB3
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x670DCFFD
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x8461D0CE
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0xC3022773
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0xC9D28907

0x3796A4AC
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0xB0D79FE8
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x76B3B3A7
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0x5399C116
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xAA025A72
starved arms in their pinafores.
0xF8DED13A

0x3796A4AC
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x0F2B43C1
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0xA28A4B6D
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0xAC358F5F
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x27E53B0A
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x5EFA918F
invariably obliged to part with.
0x742E3E5C

0x3796A4AC
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x31CC7A03
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0xACB0258A
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xE08E6108
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x4F0D83E1
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x6806E629
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x28D37533
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x8ACD37BC
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0xEF1596E3
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x402863D6
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0xA49B64BD
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xC62D8132

0x3796A4AC
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x53E2FDF7
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0xDB7AE524
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0xD35FE19E
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x7F14DF08
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x11FF58D7

0x3796A4AC
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xA1CF2C2A
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0x870135AD
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x4DC2574F
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x23C7E861
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x99D4802B
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x592D4BFD
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x6192930A
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x9821D75D
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0x7FB7C3D4
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x77677749
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0xFDF90CF2
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0xEA89947A

0x3796A4AC
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xCE637987
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0xC8C73027
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0x2268ABBF
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0x972A0346
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0x6C148514
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x825225E4
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0xB2FF9275

0x3796A4AC
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0xBC7C4AB4
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0xA89F0FE0
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x542EA04A
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0x3C9F24F8
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0xB726C970
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0x72BCCF9A

0x3796A4AC
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0xBD10DB63
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x22C5925A
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x1610E136
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x54F65817
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xCE42AF6F
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0xCB60B5D6
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x5668CB18
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x7CED7A6E
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x48487AA4
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x3B147C7F
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0x26456356

0x3796A4AC
He paused.
0x768DF121

0x3796A4AC
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x486CDAE8

0x3796A4AC
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xEF8A57A6
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x3688C941
to one."
0xA961EA7A

0x3796A4AC
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x3ED8CBB2
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0x68C25D1D
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0xF8620FE9
occasion."
0x433792D3

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x22C6E634

0x3796A4AC
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xA662670A
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x2D7F078A
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x0E010049
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0xD5717DA1
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x61B1B09A
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0xC6C2A6FD
what authority?"
0xC79C7E3F

0x3796A4AC
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0x5FD16686
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x7FE736DE
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0x0D87E125

0x3796A4AC
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x1D81B789
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0xCDF6556F
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x6104D6B5
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x6F74F9A2
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0x00E54296
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0xB82AB261
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0xEF9C0961
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x85C3F516
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0xB438BB7D
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0xA812B3A2
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0xACE8B292
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0x8A617062
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0xE3469F47
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x1AD0FFB4
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0xA101D0B7
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x655E5616
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x3E427E44
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x6E556DFD
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0xF9A64946

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x54F0A2F1
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x92CBDA56
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x41C48932
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x5283E7E0
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0x7099E9D6
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x0CA72C9C
severity.
0x1A19B59B

0x3796A4AC
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0x95A79CAD
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x5B48E261
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0xBF4F53CE
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xBD63E9B9

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0xF4A29DD0
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0xD7F82B8A
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0xDB59656E

0x3796A4AC
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0xC2A14021

0x3796A4AC
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x555592E7
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x60F0A1B6
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0x53277FD4
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x87658610

0x3796A4AC
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x2C2F1E91

0x3796A4AC
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0xF57FAB7A
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x66270BBA
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0xA66EAEB7
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0xC52FE442
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x330E4A2F
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0xE91817FF
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0xE67E4D69

0x3796A4AC
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0xB042E25B
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x29994EB3
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0xAA5EF4F0
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x194AC68C
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x9E81B9DA
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0x46892672
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x17EA6AF8
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0xA4656F21

0x3796A4AC
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0xC0017EC8
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0x96157B63

0x3796A4AC
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x680D8859

0x3796A4AC
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0x8673655C

0x3796A4AC
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0x4E429798
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x35CE40BA
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0xE085DE08
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xAB8285E4
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x473EC6D1
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0xDF4E80F8
time wasted, of--"
0xCA418551

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x48FCDF9A
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0xD87137CD
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x7594A6BF
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x87A82B08
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0xFD1C5871
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x416ECDF3
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0xF6EFC5F5
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0xCE93FCDE
false front of French curls.
0xFF6B3B5E

0x3796A4AC
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x386F4809
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x25331E40
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x6166CB37
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x66FBD755
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0xE6FE4A16
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x050C12CC
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x748E2956
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0xF671AA74
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x4DEF8829
my attention.
0x61F81F6C

0x3796A4AC
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0xB210F809
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x6F7A9FE2
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x58802EE7
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xC5E7F14D
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0xF79F338B
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0xF5EEEE37
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xC6E85F65
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xEDC4C1C9
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x5180254D
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x9B6487C6

0x3796A4AC
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x8AC54EA6
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0xC2ABDC5C
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0xFB963FA5
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x46CE76B5

0x3796A4AC
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0xD42FA580
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x6EEC5983
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x22B6CD9E
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xEA5ED0F3

0x3796A4AC
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0x14A015DF
punished."
0x999189FA

0x3796A4AC
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x4AD2DC5E

0x3796A4AC
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0xCF5794E8
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0xB508F470
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x4527BBB5

0x3796A4AC
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x911628B1
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x6FD53D0A

0x3796A4AC
"Place the child upon it."
0x4B8921DB

0x3796A4AC
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x3CF3A123
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0xB0FA6A77
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0x3A67A3B2
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0xEF8CF5FC
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x45E9F38B

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x3DECEB4F

0x3796A4AC
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x484733A5
children, you all see this girl?"
0x42A89B53

0x3796A4AC
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x15607ACB
against my scorched skin.
0xAE480FFF

0x3796A4AC
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x684AEF1A
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x5BD6B23C
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0xC848E9D9
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0x47571DD9
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x14E74C5A

0x3796A4AC
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0x084971A2
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0x4A4CA0C5
must be firmly sustained.
0x98E642EA

0x3796A4AC
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0x9A8EEF70
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x0C8A8C85
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0x4DC45B09
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xD8664CB6
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0xC049E8EC
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0xB2865EF6
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x73A72510
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x5214DAB0
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xD0A7269D
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0xF4F47459
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x018072B3
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x03516B7C

0x3796A4AC
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x02D5FC03
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0xC8C89AF5
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x436C9BEC
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x42C496B4
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0x31E654CD

0x3796A4AC
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x6F393FCE
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0xC6E80850
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xB908F476
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xC63ABE42
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x3AC1181F
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x4E6D6235
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x47316B47
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0x6616EF2B
waters to stagnate round her."
0xD8D4944F

0x3796A4AC
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x870C215A
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x2176012A
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x6FA8C0AD
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x6133AAA0

0x3796A4AC
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x445A3003
her during the remainder of the day."
0x3EDFB270

0x3796A4AC
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0xA7E2C1F9
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0xA1576975
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x7AA551C4
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0xC561F2DB
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0xD31E3038
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x1538349E
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0x87261245
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0xEFF21AD1
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x595037EA
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x5374528D
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x9B27E1A3
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x8E89CC69
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0xBFB87509
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x57EC035D
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x8694463E
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x8C553A54
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0x25DFBEFA
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xA9161A33
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0xBF81FD6F
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0x29942D2E
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x4F82292A
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0x8102C038

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0xD38B4F62
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x8641D87C
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0xC2E4C868
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0xC991ACA0
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x8FEE4F07
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0x6A90137F
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x204749E4
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x56516371
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0xDE48CD4F
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0xA1323273
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x8A938C2D
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x6B9284B3
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x42139150
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x1EAFE6A0
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0x4DF80E3D
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0x39E100C0

0x3796A4AC
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x710B0248
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x1BB63E8A
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x686835B7
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x5C660B9E

0x3796A4AC
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x9C862424
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0x07E4197B
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0xA993DA39
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x99AEFAAF
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0xD9506E19
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0xCE6AE964
first who spoke--
0xB860D667

0x3796A4AC
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xA2EFAB90
liar?"
0x2F7DF018

0x3796A4AC
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x42331943
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0xDD17295F

0x3796A4AC
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0x56A0FF5B

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x592B7B32
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0xAE4154D3

0x3796A4AC
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0xCDD80AD9

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x7E6A44F1
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x45A7E2C0
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x2D05B895
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x2854F819
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0x3AF2CB3E
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x10A366C8
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x364253D3
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x9F58915E
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x8D0F0B9E

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x69D9A3DA
gently to warm them, and went on--
0x70E899D7

0x3796A4AC
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x47EC4FA6
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x64EC9399
without friends."
0xF35A737D

0x3796A4AC
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x9B4604EF
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x75557BCB
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0x265A6722
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0xA894731F
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x2923301A
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0xBA1B6DAE

0x3796A4AC
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x0FBFBFEE
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x63E3544A
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0xB9859847
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0xF8956038
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0xA445F94B
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x0F4D176F
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0xA8361314
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0xF5DC61E9
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0xE5F2153C
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x172CE858
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0x91352DF8
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0xE875F0AC
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x22DF1651
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0xC1A36BCA
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xF71DE2F5

0x3796A4AC
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0xF65EB4FD
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x2C2EC4DE
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xC4DF0578
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0x77876303
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0xD9978B40

0x3796A4AC
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0xC3F3F7C7
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0xBEB618AF
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x96B6DD63
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0xB760090B
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0xD561B345
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x495263A2

0x3796A4AC
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0x945B091E
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x1138DFE4

0x3796A4AC
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x41CA6788
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0xA15E75F4
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xD278EC64
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x65DA0926
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x8EEEEDC3

0x3796A4AC
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x56DAFFD7
your grief away?"
0xD8D43106

0x3796A4AC
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0xAE4A36B3

0x3796A4AC
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0x3796A4AC
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0xA1CE2809
will now think me wicked."
0x51FBA39B

0x3796A4AC
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x4F0F019B
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0xE9545C2B

0x3796A4AC
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x89779569

0x3796A4AC
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0x2D409040
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x454B8918

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x0A638815
care."
0x26616585

0x3796A4AC
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0xC9F87103

0x3796A4AC
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xF740FE5F
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0x63883F9A
always keep me."
0xD8A4DBAB

0x3796A4AC
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xDCC82900
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x52FD1740
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x75CBDA23
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x6555F104
exaggerate nothing."
0x607C7B3B

0x3796A4AC
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0xE03E22B5
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0x239D014B
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0x3754DE60
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x30745C8F
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0x7A1C4182
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x74DFEE00
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0x3D16C713
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x984C828F
Temple fully believed me.
0x81D64C61

0x3796A4AC
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0xC5AE3E89
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xAEB3C199
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x5E7ED1B8
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x2F492D4A
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0xCB38E032
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x93BF6FD3

0x3796A4AC
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x486336C3
then said--
0x82D29AFB

0x3796A4AC
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x6C4ED6C9
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0xAAE681C8
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x61F67054

0x3796A4AC
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x38A87EC1
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x05065159
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x53CE46A1
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0x446B83B5
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xC7CDC059

0x3796A4AC
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x0BA136D8

0x3796A4AC
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0xC6E26862

0x3796A4AC
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x95846B79

0x3796A4AC
"It is a little better."
0x0927644F

0x3796A4AC
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x108EDD54
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0x928799D9
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0xBF3AA251

0x3796A4AC
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xED69B8CD
rang her bell.
0x4E004B6D

0x3796A4AC
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x7D70390F
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0xAC569A06

0x3796A4AC
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0x9FEC4443
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x79A21F21
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x41B6C7FF
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0xD133D17A
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0xDFF15AEB

0x3796A4AC
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xEAB382B2
There is not enough for three."
0x22651CE2

0x3796A4AC
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0x7EB3B24B

0x3796A4AC
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0xE7F81D6D

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x9689EDFC
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x6E599DA4

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0xF827B1D8
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x49D27D3E
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x6CE0AA74

0x3796A4AC
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x4FC391C7
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0x9DACAD57
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x0082F0E0
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0xF8B26EBC

0x3796A4AC
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0x634E3577
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x314B64FA
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x9A982837

0x3796A4AC
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x0207C6A2
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x455CE426
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x5568A809
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0xB156255F

0x3796A4AC
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xA8B5CD68
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0xC53EAD9E
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0xF9354E5C

0x3796A4AC
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x9B105881
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0xE673EE75
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x41DAEEED
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x4773B763
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0xD89961D4
struck with wonder.
0x61F19367

0x3796A4AC
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0xF1C18E40
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0xE0C2C52A
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0xB86F93B7
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0x01C0AA0D
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x12F0BF19
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0xA6287EE5
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x7E049A61
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0x13FBA1A7
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x9E866CA2
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x214542D2
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xE3673F9F
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0x10CF57C1
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x398EC922
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x3282227C

0x3796A4AC
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x6569E9F1
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x8F148240
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x84B3F223
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0x6957A3DF
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x8BB4A482
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xF5F3D5DF
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x3EB80165
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x149275A1
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x6E349DCB
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xB2FE6542
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x0070D991

0x3796A4AC
"God bless you, my children!"
0x6F28D232

0x3796A4AC
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0x12710DE6
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0xB5E41597
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x1E523EC5

0x3796A4AC
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x8268F2BE
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x3E75BB72
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0xCB45DFFB
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x335FB7CE
shoulder.
0x34EE5A56

0x3796A4AC
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x8C01098C
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0xB33E98D7

0x3796A4AC
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x1B17C598
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x33C66F1F
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x99597D38
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0xB020C126
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x38575B10
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0x2C93E20E
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x69CE37B6
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x360D8E70
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0x95C50A86

0x3796A4AC
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x78F17044
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x9584222A
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0xEB32E244
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x9D502EA2
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xB7A1E82D
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x4F404F22
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x08B7693E
through the ranks of my companions.
0x09BCD54B

0x3796A4AC
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x7F489E29
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0xD9E9E34F
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0xFB801615
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0xB38B7FBA
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x6C79ECAF
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x8026C4F4
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x869FE089
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0xE1DB96F5
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x944E012D
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x533A172A
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x0E6AEDE6
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0xEC61AF93
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0x5435F6F4
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0xAD8BA2D9
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0xDE0224A7
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0x6A15EA10
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0x24B83708
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x0C10DC70
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x448EDE2F
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

0x3796A4AC
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0xE310D7F1
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER IX
0x7DA2D0A2

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x7E176BE4
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0x42F384FD
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xFF44144E
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x77C68853
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x067A7C13
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x3D91E6F5
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0xDD505929
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0xF6A320C9
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x5208066A
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x56DAA34A
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x19C641A3
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0xB141FA36
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0xE44F4DF4
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x9898FECF

0x3796A4AC
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xB4CB9ABF
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0xFF25E36F
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x9A0A95B7
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x1B8C2492
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x1DE8CA74
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0xD148B416
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x7FB4F6D0
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xC428335B
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x5DC5E234
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x6B90545C
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x70EA683E
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x30A6769B
of skeletons.
0x26615E95

0x3796A4AC
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x144DB9AB
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x63EAC96E
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x207E9589
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0xE8105D98
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x75C53A5B
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xDB2B4527
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0xBB138631
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0x96673A3C
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0xB94455AD
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x462B4493
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0xB037C315
advert.
0x8EFDBEBF

0x3796A4AC
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0xFEE38446
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x8DD9E732
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0xF90DD215
question.
0xAEC233CD

0x3796A4AC
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x3CDC2EE2
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0x8E21BFA9
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0xBD5A013D
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0xBD7C3396
hospital.
0x752AAD5C

0x3796A4AC
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x8818965D
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x04FAB74D
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0xFDD5E2EA
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xCBA3E7EA
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x3017180E
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0xA84DF990
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x2E73C651
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x6883CC10
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0xA513EB57
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x8650DA1C
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xD86FE067
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x2F6A8D15
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xDFA364A4
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x0CDF95B7

0x3796A4AC
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0xEC2263A4
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x63662190
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x878C5704
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0x304480C3
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0x24444556
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0xED87CF11
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0xAE3FE627
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0xAF72349D
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0xC2765CD5
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x04578B8B
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0x75888F57
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xEC57E884

0x3796A4AC
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x642DAE84
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x30F002DB
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x7B29906C
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0xDE93E482
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0x28BC3AD0
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x4BDC42A5
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x0864AF37
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x37B0C008
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x8BC6DE6A
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x2E97EB0A
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0xCB405438
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0xC04B5371
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x9EFFEB05

0x3796A4AC
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x6715BE3A
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x27448845
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xB0E96C96
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x52160EC4
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xA5F997EA
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xBBC27E6B
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x3BB83205
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0xFC68DE1C
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x25BDA5DC
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x2B4B61C6
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x578120A9
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x858B00C1
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x2B2D1211

0x3796A4AC
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0xBECAD9E5
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xAC8880DC
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0xBE77ED8C
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x440A82D5
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0xEAC6245B
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x8DA0D056
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x4198DACF
higher things.
0x44985D1F

0x3796A4AC
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0xDE3AE789
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0xC4C6F7D1
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x545C83EE
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x9219FA79
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x6CC90A8F
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0x338C65A9
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x973A370F
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0x2CCD0914
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x4524BC41
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x3D6F371F
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x8E313054
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0xEA9A0CF4
alleviate.
0x31F6E7AF

0x3796A4AC
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0x810EFD12
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x5A1E47F6
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0xF0D1A0B7
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0x6FC30D44
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x4ED5710B
verandah.
0xB607F3A6

0x3796A4AC
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x43C9C658
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x060D4257
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x5004ABAA
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x58134014
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0x0CEC45E2
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0xC3C471AF
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0xB73BF6D1
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x382C9845
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x4CA664BE
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0xF2950FAA
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0xE365B3CD
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0xD005521C
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xD5B9BE54
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x30EFFB54
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x650C2279
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x7CA5FEA4
done before:--
0xC195B701

0x3796A4AC
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x22CE8671
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0xC85E60A0
have to go who knows where?"
0x28708B15

0x3796A4AC
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0xE3251ABF
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x8B73984A
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x0FAF74EC
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0x5F36F562
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x756CD130
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x61CD0E63
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x62EC0181
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x20DACF81
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x1127D3B6
ran up to her.
0x62771DC4

0x3796A4AC
"How is Helen Burns?"
0x8A89B0BB

0x3796A4AC
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xC93B40D1

0x3796A4AC
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0xAECC05E3

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"And what does he say about her?"
0xC16577A9

0x3796A4AC
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x4D7B27B0

0x3796A4AC
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xA4215107
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0xF1E58308
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0x482C05BD
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0x8BA6A862
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xA6D70DD3
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xB94C9EE0
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x21F6B03E
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x7E30DE8D

0x3796A4AC
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0x28AC7560

0x3796A4AC
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0xEC3A5695

0x3796A4AC
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x5FE6FAD4
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0xF1508F57

0x3796A4AC
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x8168F09A
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x3AB5664F
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xB3B6FA64

0x3796A4AC
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x27B704FD
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x8BB62D1D
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x867C54A1
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x3C2FB4E8
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x68239FB7
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0xB9D08DAF
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0xBE9EFBBA
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x0298B60B
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0x9E419E8E
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0xEADA1129
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x62C8F18A
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x8F8352BD
with her one last word.
0x2D8311F8

0x3796A4AC
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x2921D6BA
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0xDDC2D419
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0x38410426
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0x6699EBF7
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x662947DB
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0x8FDA44FC
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x0D31CF0A
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x0B3344AD
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x96A86613

0x3796A4AC
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0xEE732A43
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x05A8D3D8
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x618D4F45
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x8FF1397D
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xEE17747D
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x14AEACA4
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x17694832
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xEF889B1A
of seeing a corpse.
0xF6AEF90F

0x3796A4AC
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xB95C73FC

0x3796A4AC
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x2BE6E904
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x9C3D9C92
instantly dissipated.
0xB15BD1DF

0x3796A4AC
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0x7D13FF4C

0x3796A4AC
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0xCFA0899F
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xAF7AAFD9

0x3796A4AC
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0x1D3373E3
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x5A0E5E71
old.
0x91475A95

0x3796A4AC
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xFEDCC579
strike some minutes since."
0xF753BB32

0x3796A4AC
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x0F31ABC3
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0x0523426F

0x3796A4AC
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xE6B3E678

0x3796A4AC
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0xD25E835A

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x9616AA53

0x3796A4AC
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0xBA487213
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x5CADA58C
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x809EDB14
whispered--
0xF1CD0FEA

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0xAB87B417
quilt."
0xF600DBAD

0x3796A4AC
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xCA23A504
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0xDED3C470

0x3796A4AC
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0x33E1A0D1
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x034684C7
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0xADCC1322
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0xFFB79BFC
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0x96BB94D1
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x59E4F452
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xF6AB3D04
been continually at fault."
0xA5A6268C

0x3796A4AC
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xD38BF0E7

0x3796A4AC
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0x8A329BF0

0x3796A4AC
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x0E189CD1

0x3796A4AC
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0x0E3701EA
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0x1D0DDDCC
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0xCF6C60A3
reveal Him to me."
0x27DC54A4

0x3796A4AC
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0xC72570D7
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xB3D3D3CD

0x3796A4AC
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0xF047590A
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0xC6A38A8D
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0xD15CF3E8

0x3796A4AC
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x963766AB

0x3796A4AC
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0x6DD61DD7
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0xE5D255B4

0x3796A4AC
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x88028557
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x61F81923
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0xCB2E439D
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0xDE6D2D21
tone--
0x29C2F472

0x3796A4AC
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0x2CE851B2
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x78D88C60
near me."
0xF2E6D000

0x3796A4AC
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0x0520309B

0x3796A4AC
"Are you warm, darling?"
0xC82F99FF

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Good-night, Jane."
0x0F602B40

0x3796A4AC
"Good-night, Helen."
0xA85048E8

0x3796A4AC
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0x5945DF51

0x3796A4AC
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0xEC5CE12A
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0xD2A7653A
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x4286C3EB
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x8AC279D1
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0x8CFFDF4D
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0x0A398429
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x26AFD633
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0x255104EA

0x3796A4AC
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0x64A1E9C5
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x21012089
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
0x52F3687E

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER X
0xAF6D3283

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x5F66FE15
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x9B743716
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0xE5686D6C
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0xCFF74D9C
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x17A2EDAF
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x599D0C3C
connection.
0x6D0DC373

0x3796A4AC
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xFF506E40
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x4FCF086E
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x1995BD1D
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0xEEE94188
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x7DFDD3B7
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0xD8749A8D
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0xDA264893
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x2274FCA5
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0x28B9C385
beneficial to the institution.
0x200E1199

0x3796A4AC
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0xBF903154
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x503739BD
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x0639510F
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0x3EFD9BDC
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0xDDBE27D4
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x9264DE26
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0xD646F9F5
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0xDF2512B1
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0x6F52A630
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x404F4B35
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0xCAAFBC06
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0x1898D21A
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x3536B320
testimony to its value and importance.
0x907003B1

0x3796A4AC
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xB2600D0F
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x45139564
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0xC3AF68CF
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x99BBE8BD
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0xE62655C4
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x41A31849
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xDD9D0989
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xE057A98E

0x3796A4AC
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x3E8C672A
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0xF1BF3D16
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x714C9843
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xF8F414AB
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0xEF1AF8B0
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x78106968
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xD41D3F16

0x3796A4AC
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0xD7FBC086
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0xD6713B0D
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0xC5B830DA
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x9D8BB89E
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xBA2FE2F8
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x4887E1EF
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0xC940F620
character.
0xDDB6DA54

0x3796A4AC
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x0903D35B
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0xE04E71AE
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x9E5B0AFC
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0x933446B9
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x4F7A5F4C
of the occasion.
0x2CCD5DB9

0x3796A4AC
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x51B40E2E
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x37E04438
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0xE701FD3F
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0x48AEFD5C
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0xAA1953C9
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x62990DB7
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x30DB9DC7
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x456810CC
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x1A8DAD47
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0x1C948C63
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xE37D852A
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x7B35B63C
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x4455E3AC
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x68CCE309
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0xB62D4591
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x78D538D0

0x3796A4AC
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0x4A3D596A
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x7844A988
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x16673A07
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x358F22D1
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x25AB5064
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0xADFD3418
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x6761AFA3
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x774FF37A
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0xAFD3D890
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0xC87C4250
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0x1C74B17C
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0xDACE2E48
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0x584EB468
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0x1D1AC367
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x6D975F17
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x285FE678
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x5EE39553
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x8852FD50
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xEF44902A
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x2E08DDB3
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x49446B9C
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0x71A489E0

0x3796A4AC
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x447DDD29

0x3796A4AC
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0xED2D82E2
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x47457DFB
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0xCF004D01
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x66F48A88
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0xEB4707A1
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x3E4E22D0

0x3796A4AC
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0xCB18CA77
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0x0F26F6B1
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x599C84EF
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x1A468DBB
instantly revived.
0xD85DAB7A

0x3796A4AC
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x7E328CB8
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x6A1CE204
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0xF4C1B0C2
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0x9300E9A9
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x8F898910
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x47BD9090
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0x3492237F
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x53E9CFA1
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0x95417059
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0x4E2CCFAC

0x3796A4AC
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x73FCA8BB
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0x8AE3DC4A
think_ again with all my might.
0x2A1D098D

0x3796A4AC
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x77315058
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x27854FEB
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0xB39B8D35
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0xD09D8CC0
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x576C2845
their resource?"
0x69FBF512

0x3796A4AC
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x112EAACF
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x9569F388
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0xE0C0753F
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xFF0CA21C
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x00410533
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0x4028A087

0x3796A4AC
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0xE0825248
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0x8389225F
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x8A8BE3B2
_---shire Herald_."
0x4ADF041F

0x3796A4AC
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x54BAD48A

0x3796A4AC
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0x191622E3

0x3796A4AC
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0x104D0063
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0xBF1122F7
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0x0B2ECB82
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0x899EEFC4
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0xB152C8AF

0x3796A4AC
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x8F082AB2
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x3509F465

0x3796A4AC
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x988F8DA1
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0x90DDE8BB

0x3796A4AC
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0xFE410F85
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x2D5A52D9
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0xA2F548A5
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0x9FEDF05C
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xDFE57FAD
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0x59055649
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x0D08993F
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0x6DDCC96A
shire."
0xD745BFBC

0x3796A4AC
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0x933A36DA
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0xD786F4F4
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x2B561010
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x7C979A10
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0xF03B09CE
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x6203D92D
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0xD3FE6775

0x3796A4AC
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x8F1B4E77
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x2283CE7D
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x607E5C18
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0xCAA2DCD6
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xB97D1F3C
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xE461D424
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x99CEB5A0

0x3796A4AC
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x0857E337
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x5473AC20
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x62A1B392
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xE8BA3C1F
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0xACB86738

0x3796A4AC
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0xBBA2EE68

0x3796A4AC
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0xF96E15C6
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0xD06AE733
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x0C05CDC1
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0x646CB343
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0xDD18CD4D

0x3796A4AC
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0xA7932EA2

0x3796A4AC
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x05D79B94
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x57A2D7EB
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xC98EF88E

0x3796A4AC
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x5D70AD57
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x79D9FF0D
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0xEFAA50FE
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x4EFFC713
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0xCB2B5614
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0xCEC98065
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x4EBFC580
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x94BC1FAC
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x825F6C69
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0xF1A2F3CC

0x3796A4AC
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x2BCC4A99
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0xD0F4B171
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x5027A6DA
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0x7B739E65
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0xCDE6B747
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0xA892F183
direction:--
0x4344D0DD

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x155B5BC7

0x3796A4AC
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x36AA4D49
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x845598B2
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x83F69F9E
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0x5060B8E8
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0xBF9C58F1
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x3FAD9CB0
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xA83CF17B
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0x0F9FDF58
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x55B08033
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x9BA2257B
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x54C28E89
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x64953E58
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x235F1539
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x6331C3EE
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0xB466BB2A
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xB22AEA20
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0x1551AD1A
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0xD20CB3CE
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xD3D8D8D0
probably, be a good way from the town."
0xF758E62E

0x3796A4AC
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x932E8BDE

0x3796A4AC
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0xB52DF886
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x9E667E70
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x00A3D199
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xFCF496BA
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x09D4D96D
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0xBFE9BE91
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x72D63E93
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x4DBFAF59
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x0381F518
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x5ADB4B2F
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x668C5A4F
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x87E18D8D
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0xD38CDD76
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x8B70B005
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0x9FF72067
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x5CA10AD2
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x4D25EEA6
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xDED0D61A
forthwith be furnished me.
0x82C834A8

0x3796A4AC
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x26F7AFBF
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x4C4F153D
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x159536C1
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0x82B80DBE

0x3796A4AC
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0x1F262F8A
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0xFDDBC62C
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0xE81BFEA9
years ago from Gateshead.
0x134CF621

0x3796A4AC
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0xB376D8FA
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0x2191B063
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x6426892F
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0xBA8A456A
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x3923AA38
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x17802030
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x75CFB9B9
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0x6E1C6484
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x26961829
while the change was being accomplished.
0x1CC090B3

0x3796A4AC
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x9E608FF5
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0xA58E192D

0x3796A4AC
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xB4DC3E67
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0x26F82EEC
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x5D208D0C

0x3796A4AC
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x446EC012
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0x508A6647

0x3796A4AC
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x5B769BF8
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0xFABA5B43
complexion.
0xD8EC005F

0x3796A4AC
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x4F76B425
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x12562EAA

0x3796A4AC
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x8982FC19
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x8EC4921A
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x23155651
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x40846457

0x3796A4AC
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x1CF0D7EF

0x3796A4AC
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x34070C06

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x23DB1F81
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0xF9BF321B

0x3796A4AC
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x38E08F76

0x3796A4AC
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0xB90D15AA

0x3796A4AC
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x9081DD02
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x86F6BDE4
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x23C2EDB5

0x3796A4AC
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0xE8BC027C
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0x86B15410
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xD84B11A6
would make two of you in breadth."
0x9B8039ED

0x3796A4AC
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0x6D1FBC76

0x3796A4AC
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0xEAFC02D9
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0xE1585B7D
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xD15532DB
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0xE339683E
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0xA62BE6A0
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0xAF100757
quarrelling--"
0xDA03C76E

0x3796A4AC
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x97CAE246

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0x0A9697F9
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x021F8042
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0xCCE92B8F
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0xD814C2BE

0x3796A4AC
"What does he look like?"
0xA181C1E3

0x3796A4AC
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0xE3FC3094
has such thick lips."
0xB6EB49D9

0x3796A4AC
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x8B26AFE6

0x3796A4AC
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x53453E25
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x85BD76B1
a deal of money."
0x40A55EEF

0x3796A4AC
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x542AFDEE

0x3796A4AC
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0xDBA14DC0
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0x23792B87
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x874F6366
you were quite out of my reach."
0x6D00E1EF

0x3796A4AC
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0xAA2501D4
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0x512A88F8
shape denote admiration.
0xE50CB2B5

0x3796A4AC
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0xB81CE239
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x1CDDF85E
a child."
0xD2CE47D2

0x3796A4AC
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x157AF2B5
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0xD8757D9E
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0xE4053FBD
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x6180D9C4

0x3796A4AC
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x572247DD
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0xCAE1588E

0x3796A4AC
"A little."
0x72578018

0x3796A4AC
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0x00B7EB82
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0xE245BFDC
charmed.
0x5F04F923

0x3796A4AC
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0x11BC152A
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0xB89AA6F9

0x3796A4AC
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xB9C3FAD1
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0x775C4504
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x5A63B72A
and which she had framed and glazed.
0x2C997490

0x3796A4AC
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x0C432B50
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x146BB22A
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x1E14CB82

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x863E3348

0x3796A4AC
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0xB67564AF

0x3796A4AC
"I can."
0x88856282

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xCAC0E3E3
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0xB9E071C7
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0xA62A79E7
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x0677EC4D

0x3796A4AC
"Never in my life."
0x0BFFA5C3

0x3796A4AC
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x469C4830
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0xB3E06B54
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x09B7F264
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xB93FF521
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x8D8D2B01
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0xF25494BF
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0xECD51181
father's brother."
0xFAED3E50

0x3796A4AC
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0xC4051A4E

0x3796A4AC
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0xDD5765F5
tell me--"
0x241B3653

0x3796A4AC
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0xEDC5C73D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xC5DE8C35

0x3796A4AC
"So he went?"
0xB1C71096

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x1D727276
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x021CCFB0
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0x1CEA57BA

0x3796A4AC
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x6E1349D2
wine-merchant."
0xAE877DC3

0x3796A4AC
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x736C8344
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0x8A4143FC
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0xAF385432
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xDA68C977
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x34639CAE
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x9F51D652
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x5CA3D49C

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XI
0x64A8C37C

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x21BBC03E
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0xF9A79B68
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x63281F02
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x881B09E8
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x3577E64B
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0xB9590AE0
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x1C7E70F8
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0x56EA1625
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0x3F54BB1A
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0xC93CD0E7
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0x03C03ED6
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x543B7A14

0x3796A4AC
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xCF89EE94
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x2CCD6582
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0xE3D59138
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x0A6ED96C
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x8767736F
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0xCD8F9CDF
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0x9B79169B
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0xE387345C
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0x20778860
troubling my thoughts.
0xC48807CC

0x3796A4AC
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x25F48DC5
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x3B416FEE
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x3254A09B
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x67C206FF
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0xDC498C0A
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0xD7D021BE
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x0822DA00
the bell.
0x43D9BE9D

0x3796A4AC
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x6749C288
the waiter who answered the summons.
0xA550B663

0x3796A4AC
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x3E5F6898
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x4803463E

0x3796A4AC
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0xDFC670D8

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Person here waiting for you."
0x71E3312B

0x3796A4AC
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x0E8C6B32
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0xF5FD6AA9
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x57F93992

0x3796A4AC
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0xC923555F
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0xFD0FDC4E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x0B30AE00
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xB7212016
Thornfield.
0x23EE0DF6

0x3796A4AC
"A matter of six miles."
0x62EEC81A

0x3796A4AC
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x7D73FCE3

0x3796A4AC
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x602BD711

0x3796A4AC
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x5FA47E2D
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x170ABB2D
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0x81864BDE
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0xA10A1C28
much at my ease.
0x41E0FF6A

0x3796A4AC
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0xD028A651
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0xDF07762C
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x2B711060
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0xA7BB1393
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xFBA1CD54
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0x21C90600
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x348C3310
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x7ECC5202
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x780E9995
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x111EE016
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x403F8B54
road now, I wonder?"
0xB94764D6

0x3796A4AC
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x92F16EBA
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0xB3D3F45A
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0x1D4E9B39
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0xFA8A0A9E
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0xF73AE55B
more stirring, less romantic.
0x7B293E4B

0x3796A4AC
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0xAB608B9B
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x583D9B90
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x6057B3FD

0x3796A4AC
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0xB633A742

0x3796A4AC
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x050B71C9
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x0ADA6A63
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x2809F136
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0xD2C24505
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x49C2BB0C
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x9A688C88
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x7FD3B4E0
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x0A74ECBD

0x3796A4AC
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x65733811
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x6DABC081
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x131DCAF4
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0xEDF861EB
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x8C683CE7
itself to my view.
0x3E9E91DE

0x3796A4AC
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0xFF7248F4
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0xCF628441
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0xB9595459
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x8757876F
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x434F59E3
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x7DD27917
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0xF17FADF5
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xA03874D6
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x2DAD3AD1
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x6ACB8871

0x3796A4AC
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xEDF65DF9
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x8234864D

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x1BF02732

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xC2A0EB64

0x3796A4AC
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0x3C0FBE66
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0xF1852058
trouble.
0xAFB6BA76

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0xAC462838
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x9BB6E6E3
the keys of the storeroom."
0xA91AEA46

0x3796A4AC
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0xDB5DEAF4
delivered them to the servant.
0xA58E7ABA

0x3796A4AC
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x01B712E7
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0xF9EFCD02

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, ma'am."
0x71D5E443

0x3796A4AC
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0x1AAC8B2A

0x3796A4AC
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0x5833604C
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x97A9C6D4
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x51612B42
too soon."
0x46C7E254

0x3796A4AC
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0xDE18552A
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x82F962E9
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0xBB97A347
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0x46F45640
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x47D20403
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x73F5AC8F
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xCDC26BA2

0x3796A4AC
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x91BD9B18
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0xAA753507

0x3796A4AC
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xB5CEACC1
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x685ACA9C

0x3796A4AC
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0xF7BB54C1

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0xC0EC11EF
future pupil."
0x2CA6EBFC

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0x070EF948

0x3796A4AC
"No,--I have no family."
0x11AFC243

0x3796A4AC
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0xC346F2B1
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0xE19F0368
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x1F0E27E3

0x3796A4AC
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x75A4A924
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xCF1AB347
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0xE56946DA
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0xEA8DF0F4
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x36D7376C
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0x7EEBFCEC
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x841429EC
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0x7CE2E58F
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0x477FA037
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x28CDB76E
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x2E6C1684
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x2CB669EB
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0x1450CBA2
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x6AF6EEB2
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0xDF8273CC
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x64A611D3
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0xD8EE8D03
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x868728B0
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xC5E3279E

0x3796A4AC
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x7EFA0911
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0xA7BD6B96
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0x6CD6620F

0x3796A4AC
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x7560A8EB
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0xAE21FB2D
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xC86D6FA4
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0x3B07F76B
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0xF921DE81
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0x917721CB
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xE98D8D67

0x3796A4AC
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0x512831DC
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x29D952B5
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x36CB21C9
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0x0FA974A4
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0xE6C2C411
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0x62B60222
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x2B912DBD
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0xCDCF35FD
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0xC38237B3
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0xC6A71E03
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x0C84E114

0x3796A4AC
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0xB2346FEF
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0xE0F6BBF9
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xE0F740E1
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x4076AF6A
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0x7C5C4C1E
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xACAABF64
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0xAAC6DA2B
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0x441FD8A2
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0xF890C892
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0x05FA7699
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x2D215CF7
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x2AFE7434

0x3796A4AC
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x88AEBF01
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0xD8D5A65B
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x9C3B1588
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0x18036064
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xF0C1F074
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0xB2869F11
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0xCEF7F398
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xE44E5BD9
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x6544DB1C
an indefinite future period.
0x94284EF7

0x3796A4AC
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0xCB6FA5A8
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0x400F725E
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0x1B734021
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0xD49E0F9D
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0xBE40C627
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x6B15C9DB
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xEF9082B9
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x163D757D
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x1BAAFC1A
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0x39ED8389
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x66E15757
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x6973DBED
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x01FB65C0
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0xE8CE7056
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0x9C027248
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x81FF3721
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0xC77BDD5B
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x317F948A
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x9DEDE880

0x3796A4AC
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0x54D702D1
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0xF26D5DAB
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x2525DCEA
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0xC23FCD7F
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0x8C4C81F8
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0x2F88DABE
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x59ED66F6
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0xEBA804CC
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x996E2ACF
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0xF5F9BBF8
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0xA8CD6879
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0xBB83993A
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x7090FD7C
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0xB928AFD1
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0xA098552B
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0xDA62107E
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0xF6C269E2
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0xA4961F46
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xFE5CA65C
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x0CC06288
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xB5A3F1BB
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0xAD5881FB
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0x77521F1A
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x8AEA1FA7
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xB90FB23B
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x263D3717
house and gates.
0x62FF04B8

0x3796A4AC
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x0A0A6A93
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x2F57E8EB
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0xAC685BA4
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xEA82ED67
appeared at the door.
0xD28AE70B

0x3796A4AC
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0xE8FC85E4
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x5288D610

0x3796A4AC
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0xC791D975
much.
0xA5C1A109

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0xBB7F91E4
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xB9FFC6C6
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x4B100772
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x0A69F7A9

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x8FC64A00

0x3796A4AC
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x73EC683D
was called Rochester?"
0x6AE81368

0x3796A4AC
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xDEB44957
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x6ADCB3AF
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x93168318

0x3796A4AC
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x289279C2

0x3796A4AC
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0xC6E4F066
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x466E67ED
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0xBB02135D
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x204C575C
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x4B2E8019
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x621FA6A2
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x2BEBE11A
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0xE0ECA9A1
expect nothing more."
0x6D0B34A3

0x3796A4AC
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0xAD229A19

0x3796A4AC
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0xAA7F33D4
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x148B21ED
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x799D8677
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0xEE5D8D2F
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xCB37ED16
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xFAC24D39
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x821B87E8
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x0731D366

0x3796A4AC
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x576C61FC
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x9C56446A
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0xC5CF4316
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x19B94265
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0xB1281A08

0x3796A4AC
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x13909897
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x4E060E30
approached.
0x3B5E3D0F

0x3796A4AC
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x74716190
nurse; who answered--
0xFFE8049F

0x3796A4AC
"Mais oui, certainement."
0xD8DBFF56

0x3796A4AC
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xA2A53B88

0x3796A4AC
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x1E6EBF15
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0x5FE34E2D
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x2945D256
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x4AD3B1C9
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0xCEF989D2

0x3796A4AC
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x38F0998B
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0xB176759A
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x07048160
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x4A934284
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x631EF128
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x42BEE72D
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x1B02B749
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0xD8934FA8
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x84F58DAC
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0xB322A0C5
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0xAA81A101
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0xB9C30F6F

0x3796A4AC
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x5C9DF954
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x2A7FF934
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x3BFF6505
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x6BDD6D11
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0xCFFDF506
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x455B3B44
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x317C3A03
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x682D8F3D
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x95CA9139

0x3796A4AC
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0xE2572F90

0x3796A4AC
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0xC432229A
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0xBB501D7E
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0x3AE10A34
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0x7CCEE036
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0xAEA52F8C
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0x3C49ABA9
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x5FAC3D30
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x49719238
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x660FC81A
fed with crumbs."
0x39C969B0

0x3796A4AC
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x9B6A9DB8

0x3796A4AC
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x29B99D96
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0xE9D135AD

0x3796A4AC
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x03DC48A4
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x83520B0A

0x3796A4AC
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x2FAE1461
clean town you spoke of?"
0x25299F20

0x3796A4AC
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xFCD5D7AA
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x388736DD
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x048666FE
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xD5DBB3F6
hear me sing now?"
0xB710485A

0x3796A4AC
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x0650964C
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x1E2C6B87
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x2B3A0EE9
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x90309A4A
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x322BE791
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x99C3D16D
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0xFBCAC9E6
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0xA9B7E32B
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x94819B45
affected her.
0x3220A2C2

0x3796A4AC
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0xEAE76F85
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x4A9EAC7B
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0xFE0E236A
at least I thought so.
0xF359519D

0x3796A4AC
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x2A5AF7D2
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x19F5EA2C
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x8C261541

0x3796A4AC
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0x4EAE6FB6
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0xF86FEC8D
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x06245838
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x5FA56A1B
carefully trained.
0x5D822C02

0x3796A4AC
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x504726FC

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0xD09035F2
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x3360A46D
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0x6053D9AE

0x3796A4AC
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0xBF65788F
say, with whom did you live then?"
0xB4717ACA

0x3796A4AC
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xB7D423CC
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x0B97F267
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x6E045B53
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x6ADF23FB
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x6DDB7E2C
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0x548270EC
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x7A39BF7B
and I never see him."
0x9E4F3D55

0x3796A4AC
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xB39B8B2D
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x37A64157
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x78517D49
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x726C18F0
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xD48F5E74
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x07E7FE6B
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x1ADA9DEC
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0xE9280926
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0xFA5AA595
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x6A9390FE
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x498296EB
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x31292E10

0x3796A4AC
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x199E9771
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x6D014243
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x0516BC2B
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x53C25A7C
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0xAFC75CDA
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x807438D5
use.
0x4831EAC2

0x3796A4AC
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0xC14AE0C3
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0x5F161467
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0xC90C518F
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x3EC32A92
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0x04AE9C44
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x863FB08F
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x24B34EE9
sideboard.
0x36E4A655

0x3796A4AC
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x2DADF73D
before seen any half so imposing.
0x8328DAD6

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x9C921410
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0x18D1475E
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0xED32D87C

0x3796A4AC
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x0B2D0141
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0xD19E4F70
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x78E9064C
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0xFB6FBC19
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x0F202FA4
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0xA74F99A5
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0xA98EDE18
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0xAEAAC1EF
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x8E463EA3
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x5AC7EE78
general blending of snow and fire.
0x5EB5F335

0x3796A4AC
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0xE5D224DC
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0xA338F34B
were inhabited daily."
0xE6A81FE7

0x3796A4AC
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x3FBABCF2
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0xA7C71AA8
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x15DF8C33
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0x8E2A2834

0x3796A4AC
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0xDCF8EDDD

0x3796A4AC
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0xD0E76097
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x7D10FDE6

0x3796A4AC
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x0BE4E730

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x572A8B08
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x3BD76F71
Rochesters time out of mind."
0xFEE685B2

0x3796A4AC
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0x657AA278
liked for himself?"
0x82A99B2F

0x3796A4AC
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0xCBAEC965
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0xD06A86E2
lived much amongst them."
0x28ACC702

0x3796A4AC
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0xA284B1A7

0x3796A4AC
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0xCC8C10E7
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x4203375E
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x22751A47
conversation with him."
0x54FFFACA

0x3796A4AC
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x5EEE48F0

0x3796A4AC
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xCBBE2AF8
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0xCEE57FF7
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x149EC810
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0xAD535DBD
he is a very good master."
0x78C3854F

0x3796A4AC
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0xE4EBB076
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x43D70973
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x990BF255
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0xC6963488
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0xA23757AA
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x299219DD
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0xA74C60E1
definite notion of his identity.
0x3BF58C55

0x3796A4AC
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0xB6534443
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x825D4EB8
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0x14FF7582
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x11A5C009
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x0973E767
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x82F0DC80
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x8E87849D
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x989FFC46
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x64D6F704
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0xA2983A46
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0xA496C08D
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0x92DD9F2D
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x73EF8C35
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0xD70A6C62
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0x14F9EA43
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0xEDF8AEAC
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0xC97DAEFA
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x222D378A
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x6D34A95E
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x9B486875
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0xCE7E5191

0x3796A4AC
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x2F641E5A

0x3796A4AC
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x93993445
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x750B6FC4
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x3AB63674

0x3796A4AC
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0xAF1E2FDD

0x3796A4AC
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0xF71EC024

0x3796A4AC
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x2A8FFAEB

0x3796A4AC
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0xD80D371D
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xEBBB4284
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xF901F397

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0xECA387D3
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x777BF5F4

0x3796A4AC
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0xFFFE2C3A
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0xA64AE773
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0xAD003DCB
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x00234EAE
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0xC54C0491
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x815478EE
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x5C4B3A7A
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0xC36C925F
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0x5BB35219
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x64A9E7B3
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x1D0A19E3
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0xA81234CF
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x5AD2BBBD
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x54D47DCF
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0xF2FE0225
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0xC03DB12A
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0xCD8F0AF6

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x0379CCB3
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x751078F7
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0xD0FCD812
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0xED5A8FAC
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x803349F8
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x7C5738F3
Bluebeard's castle.
0x3BFAB8CB

0x3796A4AC
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x962B7312
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0xD08BC72B
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0xC0098EFB
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x50D7F834
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x7F304395
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x273E7E10
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x4D629C3B

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0xAF7B8806
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x5F655901

0x3796A4AC
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0x22FB0888

0x3796A4AC
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xE78728E0

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0xE66E67AE
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x39E9FED7

0x3796A4AC
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x1439682D
odd murmur.
0x7E9E219E

0x3796A4AC
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0xF1569FD2

0x3796A4AC
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0xA400FC66
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0xDD5CCB00
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x5F71F14D
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0x4F0AC1FC
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0x289044F0
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0xE2069C72

0x3796A4AC
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0x2537CC3E
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0xDD4D12F7
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0xCB6CCF21
be conceived.
0xA4AE619A

0x3796A4AC
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xEB5EDC68
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xCA69D73F

0x3796A4AC
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0xD2E963D8
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x6A1E3EEE
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0xA18AE0E3
pupil this morning?"
0x9A00EEE5

0x3796A4AC
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0x27E0D1FD
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x73F96465
hall, exclaiming--
0x220933BC

0x3796A4AC
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0xE8661820

0x3796A4AC
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XII
0xD3C2C5EC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x61D964AB
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x5113E940
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x3783B14C
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x943C585A
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0xEFABCFEB
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0xFB6B4CFD
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x6B7FF7B5
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0xA9583C0C
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0x5919E241
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0xC81CAAF1
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0x617AE326
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x19E465AA
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x0610DE42
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x30651023
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0xDD6E181F
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0xCEAC3E5C

0x3796A4AC
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0xBDDD1F89
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x38D805C4
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x50918133
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x1633DC29
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0x823FECFA
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0x9B2B20A2
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x10C4A972
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x9ACA9C5B
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0xD2F4BA6C
of her mind and character.
0x3A4AC708

0x3796A4AC
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x8F5F9710
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x3AEE2702
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x6AEA97EE
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0xA682C01E
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xD879F3C5
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0xF1BE67A5
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0xF4A5BCE0
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0x9DB3092E
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x28FCE234
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0x00BD8965
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x9389070D
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x839D5339
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x0F2CA8EF
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0xEEDD77FA

0x3796A4AC
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x869A37C4
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0xD5955F94
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x50476837
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x6BF26D54
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0xD4FF6BD9
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x44A33EDF
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0xD426D50D
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x40CC0132
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x251DFD05
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0xAB1431B2
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0xF3C14EBE

0x3796A4AC
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0xA8217E79
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x1184952D
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x5E974E48
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0xCA420436
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x6213E073
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x260B4EAF
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x1191DCA8
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0xDCE45B01
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xF3759F42
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x3414CD25
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x950C3188
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x06598879
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0xBC942863
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x1DDA9D6E

0x3796A4AC
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x283DC67C
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x6D7756A4
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x88B0C654
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0xD7A35C48
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0xD58CF571
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x5508AC86
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x6BA7A9EB
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0xE9921271
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0xAFC665A6
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x3313F96A
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0xCC3DCB6E
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0x7B552BE9
every effort of that sort.

The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x22535E60
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x0ADCD0B2
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x2B37A301
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0xD8F17B34
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xA5B22B52
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0xC168BB84

0x3796A4AC
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x12623BCE
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x039607C4
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0xBBEA2550
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x132EFE2F
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x18F85EB1
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0xE61F7C73
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x33068C17
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0x90E78209
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0x25333BBA
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x5EB86436
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xC83F5857
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x1D1E12BD
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0x37580FE4
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x4BC3947C
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x0B5F7314

0x3796A4AC
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x3E1E563A
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xB39CC717
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0xB1CE2C24
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0xB9B525A1
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0xAFC9C7BF
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0xC0F9146A
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0x5EBC2755
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xF462F546
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xDD44E766
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x4887B644
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0x88D76135
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x9BDC427A
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x0738D09B
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x6BAACF4A
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0xB2701377

0x3796A4AC
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x7489BFF0
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xB4688420
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x5E1CA61F
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x64F7DAA0
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0xF0A64957
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x9C6AAD67
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x0192503F
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0x1E8A2D89
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0x4E299CF8
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x23523C8D

0x3796A4AC
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0x453BD764
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x991C151B
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x9AC6E55A
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0xC677675F
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0xA6A8050E
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0x634D24E1
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x6C7B87C1
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0x60C62D6F

0x3796A4AC
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x76A94D52
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0x3F5C890D
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x415697B4
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x11C880F9
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0xC8D6964F
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x562489B3

0x3796A4AC
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0xD3149C88
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x03CADA25
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xEA718403
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x1F5C01AC
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xBAC6B1A2
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x074C62FA
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0x9CD4A0CF
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x315B2D64
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xD36FF610
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0xCB26D27E
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xBF223630
me.
0xD35B5291

0x3796A4AC
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0xE91FDB3E
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x71F682DD
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x378C8D7E
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0xFF1B4008
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x34B28E9E
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0xF82A51CB
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0xA5784A99
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xD78A6552
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x893B724E
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0xED88C479
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x95AFC580
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x44C66FE0
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0xEA45FA34
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xF00883F8
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x5D5C5071
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x4BFA3525
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x74C3ABD3
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x2900F13F
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x05B5DE05
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x0565AB5C
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x48907D8E
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0xF630FBD2
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0xBEB5905B

0x3796A4AC
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x994B5736

0x3796A4AC
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x3EAE6740
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0x9BC4436E

0x3796A4AC
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x3771D63E

0x3796A4AC
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x87B3408C
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0xE2B7BF5D
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0x7D1937A6
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x068D45BB
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x33C184C9
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x11F3BDC8
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x5B42450D
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0xC27C0501
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0xD1D2BE4A

0x3796A4AC
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0xDF358C06
now drew near him again.
0x325AD035

0x3796A4AC
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xC82F9A73
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xE6543D2B

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0xB1866749
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x74820E14
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xDE17867F

0x3796A4AC
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0xC586949C
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xB69479B4
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x080F3107
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x96D1B91E
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x6017AE18
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0xE3C24F02
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x15287908
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0xC4EA863D
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0x7C01A12A
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x55B2A0D4
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x55DCF8D0
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0xD290C643
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x3F28BA36
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0xEFA0D88B
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0xD8B46E77
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0xECB13E56

0x3796A4AC
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x190042BC
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0xA61EF516
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0xEF676F27
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0xE7D8AC00
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0xB024DECC

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0xF094F963
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0x18D4F046

0x3796A4AC
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x2418ABD4
direction before.
0x318672E7

0x3796A4AC
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x1D3D0E53
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0xD86E0BE8

0x3796A4AC
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x76EDBE48
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0x1D99383E
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0xB835821D

0x3796A4AC
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0xF5ED3E73
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x36683B35
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x8FC21C3F
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0x75E45042

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Whose house is it?"
0x164C044C

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x09D8CD7F

0x3796A4AC
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0x099614E4

0x3796A4AC
"No, I have never seen him."
0xD6957801

0x3796A4AC
"He is not resident, then?"
0xBAAF0DAA

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0xBD54ECAC

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot."
0xCF51246F

0x3796A4AC
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x1A9CF2DA
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x37CFEF93
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0xABDEA255
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x8A8EC545

0x3796A4AC
"I am the governess."
0xBADAC09B

0x3796A4AC
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x4A3D1E31
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x069C5091
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x0559D6FE

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x185A5A29
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0xEA06B85D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0x442C1A94

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0xB4BB4759
afraid?"
0xF62D4975

0x3796A4AC
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0xA18D59B5
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0xF783A512
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xD6E23F8B
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x3F926129
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0xDD5AAFB2
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xF9106A43
he laughed.
0x417063CD

0x3796A4AC
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0xBCF21B93

0x3796A4AC
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0x07E4F802
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x6491DB26
come here."
0x40A2E328

0x3796A4AC
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0xA7059478
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xDEC56F36
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0xB17D99B2
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0xBF860344
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0xDB43EF12

0x3796A4AC
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x31A36F96
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0xEBBCB8FA

0x3796A4AC
I sought it and found it.
0x90B335F2

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0x37885705
you can."
0xDAB84B8C

0x3796A4AC
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x7D0428D2
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0x13F92D84

0x3796A4AC
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x2B3E644B
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xDFFA50AC

0x3796A4AC
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x6BAD390D
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x9AB5FAF6
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x60B76C17
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0x901FDF88
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xEB69244E
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x9CB1E740
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0x21DC0DB8
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x6334C484
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0xC8FAAFDB
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x5F375E7A
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0xDABA6E37
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x6C2870EF
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x1FB9506A
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x84EAD20B
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x6BA9AA7B
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x1DF2ECF8
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x1D0EC095
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x6C103ADD
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0x4CBB9511
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xA3148542

0x3796A4AC
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0xA4B87304
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0x330F39F5
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xD2AECDF5
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0xDE7B9110
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x48C171E4
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x764BD243
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0x60B950D1
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0xFA29972B
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x583E6841
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0xB76FA5B7
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x278442AB
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x8DBB0B3D
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x754D701D
as it would be under his.
0xF2117FFA

0x3796A4AC
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xB5CC5282
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0xC5B68FD8
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0xCF515AD2
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x7857C8EA
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x283F036E
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0xB4E58548
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0xE3B7CC35
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xB878474B
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xEA594434
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xF42B52A4
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x68F23682
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0x540E4695
door, and went in.
0x27330BC8

0x3796A4AC
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0xBF52448E
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0xC05C0EC8
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x440025AA
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0xE57B959D
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x6B724447
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x6B194A99
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x677840FE
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0xBF938FD9
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0xFAD2576B

0x3796A4AC
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x4F9E51F5
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0xADE2017A
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0xF439C996
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0xAFD8355C
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0xB90A27A6
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x7691499C
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x8F981BE8
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x7AE5D122
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x6CF4EA8D

0x3796A4AC
"What dog is this?"
0xB82F30B6

0x3796A4AC
"He came with master."
0x2C43CF23

0x3796A4AC
"With whom?"
0x3EA21E8B

0x3796A4AC
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x8CA5907A

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xF9F2A972

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0xE9431D57
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0xC338235B
sprained."
0x2E030DB6

0x3796A4AC
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0xAA8C3178

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x25DDA5DA

0x3796A4AC
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0xB62E4564

0x3796A4AC
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0xA6E6F0C2
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x1CDF9EDD
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x0651E778
upstairs to take off my things.
0x89CEB359

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XIII
0xC57E633E

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x3FD2B773
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0xBD428C9A
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xCF7EB0A5
and waiting to speak with him.
0x9B9E27EC

0x3796A4AC
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x86F3E1AC
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x26DC854C
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0x0B2344CE
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0xA2BFA1B8
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0x277573F0
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0xCDD7A1CC
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0xF49D25D6
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0xD14E37F1
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0xF3C627A7

0x3796A4AC
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x585A2C6B
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x7C0B7C75
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x71995C8B
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x378D5622
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0xF86239A6
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x3423A9F5
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x04566408
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0xE0B52DFB
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x04CA18CA
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0xF7010DFC
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x4B065702

0x3796A4AC
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x3A59F100
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x7A0645F5
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x38E9A53B
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x2BB6FACF
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0xF0FCBA2B

0x3796A4AC
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xDEFD79C5
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x64D130AE
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x16D968FC
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x5C083A1D
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x923BFBFD
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0xBDBC2030
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0x58959D57
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xD32DDB86
fireside.
0xFCDADEEA

0x3796A4AC
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x3DFF96EC
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x16BF6A38
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x377545B8
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0x174E4C78
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x27AD3C1F

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0xCE9154DB
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0xAA375D1A
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x45336A86

0x3796A4AC
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xE9BCD9B4

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0xDD3C4F15
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x2D72C978
candle."
0x6E16A400

0x3796A4AC
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x6E40DA15

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x895F319D
is here."
0x8A49D87F

0x3796A4AC
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xE83B222A
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0xA898A9B9
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x95FB9C06
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0xF3007665
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0xC1521448

0x3796A4AC
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0xA606A074
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0xB1305B14
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x04936FD3
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0x6CE4A304
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0x343302F2
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0xCC9F144B
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x0677DD95

0x3796A4AC
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x126732C2
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x02B87A80
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0xC6DE2139
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x4552AE6D
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0xA0699AE7
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0xD2F78110
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0xFB948AB2
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x5A22178C
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x36B8DB8F
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0xF0943708
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x1916EFEE
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x38194EA9
neither tall nor graceful.
0x0D340F58

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x421F952A
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0x28E634C5
lifted his head as we approached.
0x5D72DDDB

0x3796A4AC
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0xEE56BBFD
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0xC9FFBE83

0x3796A4AC
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x0BE47422
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0xC2775C4F
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x369A68E9
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0xF749C8A2

0x3796A4AC
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0xAEBCB64A
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x4A79155C
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x2D1ACE11
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x20694EBF
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0xF8CCF288
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0xCFF2CA55

0x3796A4AC
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0x0F34FF9D
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0xD19ED11A
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0x7A235F80
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0xA1457DD7
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x9C9712C2
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0xBB8735D4

0x3796A4AC
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x18EBDD64
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0xDF7891EF
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x5D28FB27
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0x1DC119D0

0x3796A4AC
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x0358BB46
might perhaps spill it."
0x526F6693

0x3796A4AC
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x8E56B887
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x1987F3E1

0x3796A4AC
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x98BC9F6A
votre petit coffre?"
0xC2E9B0EE

0x3796A4AC
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x94CA5186
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0xBD0C9E85
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x3FE8AEDC

0x3796A4AC
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x933474E9
thought pleasant things."
0x705A7E8B

0x3796A4AC
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x76FD4BA0

0x3796A4AC
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x7B18AE06
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x3B807929
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xF85649E4
nature."
0x0AFBC812

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0x0EC45E15
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x55AF2A36

0x3796A4AC
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x609B77F8
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x55FA590C
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x3ED34FA4
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x7550F763
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0xE3A4E7AB

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0xB9FC4435
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xCBD9D388
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0xDC2344DC

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0xB7685116
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x4668B220

0x3796A4AC
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0xA8FF08AE

0x3796A4AC
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x80325ACE
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x17B9E457
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x9B597FB3
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xC426E88D
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0xCF5E848B
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x4D07B6E4

0x3796A4AC
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0xE5DCCAE7

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And you came from--?"
0xD06CB8D8

0x3796A4AC
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xAEABE23C

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x779237CF

0x3796A4AC
"Eight years."
0xD7EB6B86

0x3796A4AC
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x88FA61F7
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0xB4AAA1D7
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0xD1887CFF
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x2996C031
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0xC22A3034
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xA35DA8C1

0x3796A4AC
"I have none."
0x38087BCE

0x3796A4AC
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x622726F3

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0xEEC22B77
that stile?"
0xF78FD119

0x3796A4AC
"For whom, sir?"
0xA5303DFF

0x3796A4AC
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0xA45B7194
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0xD9A8F2BD
causeway?"
0x6600AFCF

0x3796A4AC
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xEC3C9BC9
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0x3D3DA207
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x736C0F80
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x27251945
revels more."
0x4546AB7B

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xAD5EA0E9
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x4D5BA015

0x3796A4AC
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x088586A0
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x36E15D10

0x3796A4AC
"No; none that I ever saw."
0x838BF3EA

0x3796A4AC
"And your home?"
0xD97DC422

0x3796A4AC
"I have none."
0x38087BCE

0x3796A4AC
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0xACF5527B

0x3796A4AC
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0xF645E937

0x3796A4AC
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0xB5614D9E

0x3796A4AC
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xB1C69793

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x15E95E15
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x7AABFABE
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0xBF78E666
Adele."
0xDF799AEE

0x3796A4AC
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x1ACB8D6A
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x9D1C63B7
felling my horse."
0xC924FD66

0x3796A4AC
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0xA4078CA4

0x3796A4AC
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0x0340E6CA

0x3796A4AC
The widow looked bewildered.
0xF5BF5AD7

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x0D1B619F

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0x3796A4AC
"Have you seen much society?"
0x688411B9

0x3796A4AC
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0x9D3704E7
Thornfield."
0x00E0F721

0x3796A4AC
"Have you read much?"
0x45E4C777

0x3796A4AC
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0xA35DEDA7
very learned."
0x29F70F88

0x3796A4AC
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x2601C945
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0x8918D3D3
parson, is he not?"
0xAE2FC5B8

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0xD4FD24EE
would worship their director."
0xB4BF910A

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, no."
0x4DEADEE2

0x3796A4AC
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x8C70D5EB
sounds blasphemous."
0x8A4C2667

0x3796A4AC
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x38D9B83A
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x1A3CF86D
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0x2A848A91
hardly sew."
0x0CE7324E

0x3796A4AC
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x02017F79
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0xADB28B92

0x3796A4AC
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0xD149555E
Rochester.
0xA9F141D6

0x3796A4AC
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0xE13F74FD
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x045A2BF0
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x02E731EA
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0xBEDBFC85
to bed."
0xE4112024

0x3796A4AC
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x4EAD6EFD

0x3796A4AC
"About ten."
0x175A0011

0x3796A4AC
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0xAC7006C1

0x3796A4AC
I assented.
0x6AD9D6F7

0x3796A4AC
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x89A37D6E
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x6AC9CD0C
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xE52ED1C5
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0xA3E4058D

0x3796A4AC
"A little."
0x72578018

0x3796A4AC
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0x244B3D6F
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x9BCAAB2C
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xEC0A9A5B
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x676A308F
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xCA40FACF

0x3796A4AC
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x168B1648

0x3796A4AC
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x8AF40425
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xACE30BA6
not well."
0x687704B3

0x3796A4AC
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x0D001167
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x84622D2E
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0x5DA612D8

0x3796A4AC
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x54CC3687

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x77F6A75C
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x67205E50
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x5C43ADBD

0x3796A4AC
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0x2C33C8E7

0x3796A4AC
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x5594AEB5

0x3796A4AC
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x46CA67DE
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x9672C9E6

0x3796A4AC
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0xC9C9AEF5
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x204F2780

0x3796A4AC
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x88CE6618
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x34D04B88

0x3796A4AC
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xB49258EB
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0xA812B8FD
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0xA13D1361
hand yours?"
0x30DC992D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0xA3B2C003
some thought."
0x50A45DF6

0x3796A4AC
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0x31905C91
other occupation."
0xDD22EF7D

0x3796A4AC
"Where did you get your copies?"
0xDB98B94B

0x3796A4AC
"Out of my head."
0xA0A87E6B

0x3796A4AC
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x635D33B2

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0xF51BC594

0x3796A4AC
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0xDE55366D

0x3796A4AC
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0x367A9B5D

0x3796A4AC
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0xFD8AEB19
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0x34A6720A
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0x357B1FFD
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0xC1C57000
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x8DCDCEFC
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x921AAB5F

0x3796A4AC
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x3668020D
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0xF20E5C29
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xB7E4D534
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x659CF703
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x3ADD894E
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xF6F39DF9
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0xABEF35CE
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0xDD5E0934
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x216F2CEB
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x01AC9D27

0x3796A4AC
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x353FC7EE
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x46AA4F22
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0xF029BEAA
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0xD1A686F2
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x2D7B6727
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0xF371B9ED
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0xE066171E
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x272EAD08
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x86632E69
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0xEE098D4A

0x3796A4AC
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x6659EEA9
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0xC6A0C117
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x6AC763AB
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xDC9676EC
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xA54D0A4F
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x4DED5D0B
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x351A800D
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x26E2876E
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x6BC047EF
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x3FC6BD1F
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x1E602952
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xAF703D3D

0x3796A4AC
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0xB4DD362F
presently.
0xF30B9A62

0x3796A4AC
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x9113CE49
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0xCA762824

0x3796A4AC
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0xA3D6AECF
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x2C5AEEB0
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x33BEFC27
each day?"
0xC907FBB8

0x3796A4AC
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x62C580D7
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0xD1F634A6
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0x3FF0F66C

0x3796A4AC
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0x3DE44E0C

0x3796A4AC
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x92E468EC
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x297521A2
powerless to realise."
0x175E0E31

0x3796A4AC
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0xBFD001F6
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0x5F6A72ED
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0xC3D39F20
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x7AEDE8C3
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x9D489A3F
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x24CFE664
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0xB3113044
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0xA41CD765
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x68BB61FB

0x3796A4AC
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0xA3B47D76
watch, he said abruptly--
0xD83CD469

0x3796A4AC
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x9FB4B6D0
so long?  Take her to bed."
0x7299DBB7

0x3796A4AC
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0xB6FDB56F
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0xF884C8E0
much.
0xA5C1A109

0x3796A4AC
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0xD39B775D
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x76C40C25
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x552FBAEB
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x202A0065

0x3796A4AC
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x2EAB9EB9
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x347EE43F

0x3796A4AC
"Well, is he?"
0x6B87D62C

0x3796A4AC
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x619E588C

0x3796A4AC
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xC42FCC9E
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xFD3E7014
temper, allowance should be made."
0x768E0349

0x3796A4AC
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0x3796A4AC
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x8F445AB2
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0xB86ECF94
make his spirits unequal."
0x8FAF9E04

0x3796A4AC
"What about?"
0xCAE3F9C5

0x3796A4AC
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xD0A4837E

0x3796A4AC
"But he has no family."
0xB3D43E76

0x3796A4AC
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0xFEDCFC13
brother a few years since."
0x1480F185

0x3796A4AC
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x4DCCFCBE

0x3796A4AC
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0xE8A66379
the property; only about nine years."
0xB855B597

0x3796A4AC
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xAE35D57B
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x66B42E43

0x3796A4AC
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x5E1040AC
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0xEEB7B8E2
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x4A697BEE
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x3902F047
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x7943245C
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x7DCB478D
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0xC7372ECB
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0xAFC3337C
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0x1F4B187A
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0xF3A38AB1
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0xB7ECFD22
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x88F03743
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x05928868
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0xED0DD0EC
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x0D0F804A
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0x141A3444

0x3796A4AC
"Why should he shun it?"
0x7705CC45

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x76FDBB60

0x3796A4AC
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0x62124694
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xB66A632C
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0xB6A71E9D
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x7617767B
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x83B8350E
subject, which I did accordingly.
0xC860ECD4

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XIV
0x2A304247

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xC295830E
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0xB2B50A5D
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xAFD1E7C6
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x75C9E487
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x1DC85C75
generally did not come back till late at night.
0xB121B054

0x3796A4AC
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x7E5ABA9A
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x5A1B0061
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x5E30B79D
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x71275BF3
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x3EA022AD
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xF03C77D3
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0xC5A9F347
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x69D41AD4

0x3796A4AC
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0xDBC50B34
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0xBCD1351E
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xBF3C2DD7
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x0507D297
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0xD16AA237
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0x707386E6
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x15340E99
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0xA09F84E1
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x9BF3B504
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0x0A651743
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x3E3CE85A
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x9B5A8C88
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x71FE91F0

0x3796A4AC
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x20962F8F

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x94868799
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x6C1537A2
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0xA39F23F8
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0xD156BFBA
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0xF323D5A3
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x4CA61D56
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x74CCE748

0x3796A4AC
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0xB34CBD80
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0xE64940CF
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xDDC552DB
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0xB093AD07

0x3796A4AC
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xA9022F13
contemplation.
0xAF60A132

0x3796A4AC
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0xA3D9AFA5
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0xBB963EB9

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x32262441
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0xC32C9980
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xAD28A26B
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x5C054E3E
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0xFFD4E01B
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x864991BD
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x24A4917E
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0xBAFB0C44
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x8E5FE48C
said to be thicker than water."
0x2CC55159

0x3796A4AC
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x5A1E3652
knitting-basket in hand.
0x0136B6F5

0x3796A4AC
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x46312A01
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0x68247D19
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0x71E0A0F1
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xBD586084
performed."
0x065604BB

0x3796A4AC
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x90ED445C
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0xE0D35A30
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x6A31E8C0
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0xEA2CF4EA

0x3796A4AC
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x9BE9C1EB
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x0431B84A
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x0E4A8C21
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0xC8EAA140
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xA75AA0E9
mind to do."
0x19DC2193

0x3796A4AC
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0xE6A58991
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0x79B7A817
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x100B2927

0x3796A4AC
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0x6DFCCDB6
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0xACBA9B91
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0xC367B37B
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x55D7B744
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x5BA0970F
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xB004231D

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x6B643FA4
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x7B691724
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0xA8BFC37F
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x4F995B8E
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0xBA0298F8
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x8279FEED
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0x510D5095
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0xAB5178F2
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0xE3665AB1
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x33AF75F5
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x4E1CC4D8
feeling.
0x15F95CD3

0x3796A4AC
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x2FF086CD
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x4A3FAF6E
fastened on his physiognomy.
0xB542B3A5

0x3796A4AC
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x3E5B0FA8

0x3796A4AC
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x5C1B7CD7
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0xF3DE4827
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0xEFB98FA4

0x3796A4AC
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x15AD19E3
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0xCD136A03
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0xBB0D4425
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x0896FA99
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x092ED618
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x4E6A6D82
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0x634FB6F2

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0xE4C50B83
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x41493D98
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xC39DDC18
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xE106387E

0x3796A4AC
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x7157EE00
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x67AA9A8E
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x200FB23D
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x9EFE39A2
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0x75B529AF

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xCAF12DD1
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0xD76DED7B

0x3796A4AC
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0xA1BDC592
does my forehead not please you?"
0x2B0BDA59

0x3796A4AC
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x70667092
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x7F936300
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x391E9322

0x3796A4AC
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x85BA4B0B

0x3796A4AC
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x4F3DD4BA
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x149EDC89

0x3796A4AC
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0xDEED378E
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0xFD2423ED
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x57465CDD
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0xB6CFD5C1
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0x690B73F3
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0xB8467CF2
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xAE6365B8
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x19DC426D
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x359A3AC7
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x1270E8D1
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x1CAAB344
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0xD564BAF3
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x5371B8AF
me?"
0x826209F6

0x3796A4AC
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x024B6DE6

0x3796A4AC
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0x5E0737C5

0x3796A4AC
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x43B7545F
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x7191A285
capable of being re-transformed?
0xE0EA7D98

0x3796A4AC
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x81CC1554
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x31A22AE6
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xDA5DDE93
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0xE5DD5C04
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x1C5CE7F7
to-night."
0x99AA87AC

0x3796A4AC
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0xC2B33D53
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x4689BB75
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x48F71FFB
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x1A131A34
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0xB2A85D79
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x6750C817
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x31A996BE
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x454D7337
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0xDB23AE43
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0xBF79D3B3
confidence.
0xFFAF9E71

0x3796A4AC
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x8634005C
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x4B2A5281
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0x96CF26E7
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0xFCDBDC1D
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x755DF02A
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0x3894F012
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x63840382
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x1BEA7D2B
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xADEAFC3E
you--therefore speak."
0x303EA80C

0x3796A4AC
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0xCA79BDF2
smile either.
0xD0146C74

0x3796A4AC
"Speak," he urged.
0x3BCB30EC

0x3796A4AC
"What about, sir?"
0x17391FE6

0x3796A4AC
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xFA156C6A
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x309F29E4

0x3796A4AC
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0xFF180163
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0x94BF2F1D
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xA7C568D9

0x3796A4AC
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xDC08906B

0x3796A4AC
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xC4C439C8
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x07590B4E

0x3796A4AC
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xCA4A2BDE
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x15A306E7
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x2F623AB6
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0x948E11F8
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x09B08972
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0x938E7405
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x95FC739D
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0xA02C3E6C
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x69DF01AC
rusty nail."
0xD6967A4D

0x3796A4AC
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x2C77A334
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x3159C7CF

0x3796A4AC
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0xA6D907B6
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0xEB2211F0
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x91071C71

0x3796A4AC
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0xCFEEEA6E
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x62E8A44B
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x242A4920
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x1F596C6E
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x13EA5EB5
people in one house?"
0xFADEF8D9

0x3796A4AC
"Do as you please, sir."
0xE8A7CC90

0x3796A4AC
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x7220FC29
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0xFC9C04E9

0x3796A4AC
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0x571FD765
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x6574826D
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x1DBBB57B
and experience."
0x8C5D720E

0x3796A4AC
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x0829CDE0
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x364AEDD0
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x0934E2E8
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0xEA8B80F9
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0x807529A8

0x3796A4AC
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xF7978837
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0x56846225

0x3796A4AC
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0xC90B54E6
expression; "but speak too."
0x228C1DFA

0x3796A4AC
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x95C69782
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0x78BEA25B
their orders."
0xB64F8DB7

0x3796A4AC
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xC5DCDF56
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x56E0B52A
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x289B2704

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x8C9DFF6F
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xCACF1E8E
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x69AB6A47

0x3796A4AC
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0xDB666B12
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0xD1CC3E4F

0x3796A4AC
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xB15526E3
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x191EBC37
salary."
0xB0C4EB39

0x3796A4AC
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0xA24587EA
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x247F2680
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x0CA24AF9
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x0B6754CF
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0xEB910CDD
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x9685DD78
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x77B2BB8C
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0x0AE28A21
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0xBB49570B
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x133597DF
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x913DE6FC
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x312B5576
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0xAC8814D0
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0xD8B07478

0x3796A4AC
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x6EC515DB
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0xA278B9CA
as well as imagined--
0x2B2C2DE5

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0xEB44563B
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x16193EE3
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0x44A7EDD4
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x2871F972
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xFC249CFE
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x84F2F259
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x739A7DED
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x9E7941C9
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0xA86D102B
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x9B918966
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x6845635D
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0xF4612BCC
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x28667700

0x3796A4AC
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x7B176C0A

0x3796A4AC
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x022E0370
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0xE5C5D486
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x0659D716
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x83437BC5
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0x89BDE0F8
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0x42B88D6F
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x6BBE8080
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0xC2899A86
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x4B3572CC
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xA74374ED
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x4DFBE1E2
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0x968E1F5F
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0xB1C37318
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0xAA92D5F4
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0xE16B76FE
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x2ACBF5CC
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0x870963F2
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0x304EF454

0x3796A4AC
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0xFD446E62

0x3796A4AC
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0x540DFDA5
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0xBDC25700
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x8231C44E
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x11AE8BA0
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0x317B8B04
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0xB00673B8
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0xB075D284
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0xCAB9AE65
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x97B3315A

0x3796A4AC
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x7FAC769B

0x3796A4AC
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0xA4A22EB8
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0xA028BA75
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0xD7EAA13D
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0x769330CB
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0xB640591B

0x3796A4AC
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0x1C8AAFCA

0x3796A4AC
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0x95B2CF09
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0xDEF15EED
moor."
0x0847A561

0x3796A4AC
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0x65F853F5

0x3796A4AC
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0x6F047D40
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0x54AE7A7A
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x236BD97B
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0xB08DE4CF
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0xF9F22794

0x3796A4AC
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x78FAA958
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0x3BB4D520

0x3796A4AC
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x40B14BE1
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0x16DF2883
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x428A3F82
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0xDF29403E
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0xFDAA49A2
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0x7E9F060B

0x3796A4AC
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0xDD239691

0x3796A4AC
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0x889A6A43
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0x0BE2C7C9
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0x0F626A6F

0x3796A4AC
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0xFB69BB62
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0xB8C42E81
misery if you listen to it."
0x88D64883

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0x99FFAF89
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0x0656265C
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0xA86D1A9F

0x3796A4AC
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x5152CAB4
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0xA850921F
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0xA8732FA4

0x3796A4AC
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0x4FD63FD7
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0xA6A7305B
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x95772909

0x3796A4AC
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0xD1A4B30F
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x00CB53DE
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0xA0C46F29
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0xC6769ADC
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0xC5405DAC
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0x8008F118
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0x94818CFF
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0x3076D2DF
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0x9F9FE121
which you might revert with pleasure."
0xDEF6F1E2

0x3796A4AC
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0x916BDB4B
paving hell with energy."
0xBF078ED5

0x3796A4AC
"Sir?"
0x4A6427AA

0x3796A4AC
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0x999C302D
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0x1F083510
been."
0xD1DFDECA

0x3796A4AC
"And better?"
0xB40BF0D8

0x3796A4AC
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0xE261BF29
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0x7568EBF6
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0x58994F85
and Persians, that both are right."
0x612DAABB

0x3796A4AC
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0xD560BAA7

0x3796A4AC
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0xC908A343
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0x5BBF8DAF

0x3796A4AC
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0x387C94BA
is liable to abuse."
0x98B80EE6

0x3796A4AC
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0xB38DBABD
abuse it."
0x54BCA5F2

0x3796A4AC
"You are human and fallible."
0x1369A7B8

0x3796A4AC
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0xD3DB0FB5

0x3796A4AC
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0xA0A4B07B
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xB56AD047

0x3796A4AC
"What power?"
0xC4AB300E

0x3796A4AC
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0xBC16B1B4
right.'"
0xEDE03A6C

0x3796A4AC
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0x40FCFFF6

0x3796A4AC
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0xBE448D29
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0xC10D108F
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0x1CB5D160
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0x0589176C
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0xA227CF00

0x3796A4AC
"Where are you going?"
0x6E377895

0x3796A4AC
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xFF3CA48D

0x3796A4AC
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0x60A8F79D

0x3796A4AC
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0xE7C4865A
certainly not afraid."
0x7FEAAF54

0x3796A4AC
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0xF4C879FC

0x3796A4AC
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0x10ABF6CC

0x3796A4AC
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0x3E8B9C0F
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0xC6A99593
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x0F0A70C8
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0xFD989263
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0xBCAA6797
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0xDD2E1BA7
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0x8D5E8439
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x03AD2930
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0x575283F4
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0x9DDC059D
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0x8D995993
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x066611F3
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0x34371F82
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0x450BAC54

0x3796A4AC
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x4D18EECE

0x3796A4AC
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0xBA28C9D4
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0xF4FFB1FB
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0x31CAE7B4
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0xD35E80DF
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0x17FF2BAE
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0x0760E95D
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0x4D99C1B4
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0x4487D2CB
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x008E4092
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x07B72D8F
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0x62C4912C
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0xAC7900BF
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0xDE30D4CC
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x41E45F8F
will be realised."
0x63EA79D5

0x3796A4AC
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0x14CB8DF2
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x84B62808
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0xD681B9B3
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0x9779EB31
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0xC570F1D2
and small white satin sandals.
0xE8EBCC84

0x3796A4AC
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0xDBF3A729
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0xDC96447F

0x3796A4AC
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0x5A895F6D
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0x62773E7A
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0x455535B2

0x3796A4AC
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0xA53018F8
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0xEDACD2C4

0x3796A4AC
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x12A1D49B
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0x5B899F1E
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0xC975054B
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x23799CC8
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0x38798F8E
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0x9A16F387
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x18ECA9F5
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xB0DF0339
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0x2A5B02F8
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0xA6B3A717
Good-night."
0x94695987

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XV
0x230AFA06

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x81492A10
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0x3B56BAEF
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0xA27F1A74
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0xB26A423F

0x3796A4AC
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0xE3D823CC
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0xA25B6816
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0xC3657CC6
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0xD18DE87C
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x5C172EF7
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x0EC8975E

0x3796A4AC
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0xC55A78A1
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x5F61E104
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0x4AD72AD7
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x6B1108D4
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0xF60F0266
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0xFE17EB54
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0xF66E1219
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0x3530A8CA
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0xE72B1FB4
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0x3986C0B4
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x805D9CEF
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0xF0E56D37
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x2748EDD5
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0xB250A6B8
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x607F7D87
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x77C4F783
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x98CCD067
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0x40453A15
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x1D09AAC5
now, if you will excuse me."
0x145188E0

0x3796A4AC
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x344A1F60
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0xFDEBB2C7
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x698A88A7

0x3796A4AC
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x7965A80E
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x8653570A
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0xF0519923
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0xD5722EF8
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xAE210A23
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0xCB3371D5
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x4700889B
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xE27280ED
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0x55EE7282
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0x26B2E1CC
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x84524375
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x7BA0B657
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x8E6FE9E4
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x70D97089
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x5CDA8E1F
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0x908557BA
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x623A33BF
cochere_ of the hotel.
0xE08B6CA4

0x3796A4AC
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0xEC47A247
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x9D17C180
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xD6C250B3
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x6E6B1EF0
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xB62F0D9B
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x1873CC9C
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x4A8ECEF8
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0xED9BBB3C
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x66F8B6E6
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0x9AB02EEC
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x01B1B762
current--as I am now.
0xEE19C082

0x3796A4AC
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0xD54F958C
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xA7021A40
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0x5251A7FF
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x96CCF750
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x5916347B
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0x880BFBBC

0x3796A4AC
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0xFEE4539E
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x51D79130
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0xEBDD1CE9

0x3796A4AC
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x2A21CBBD
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0xC189F18B
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x040F439F
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x7A197BDC
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x6F19105B
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x906E2E77
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0x0EF99386
his countenance: he went on--
0x3825EFB8

0x3796A4AC
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x975D702D
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x470DC0B9
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0xE776550F
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x15A9F583
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x11D95941
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x0F7D8F95
if you dare!'
0x180DE8F9

0x3796A4AC
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0xE3DAC64A
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x678B15DC
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x2600982A
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0xDF0B56CF
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xFEF37548
but straw and rotten wood."
0x62927414

0x3796A4AC
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x098C1C90
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x2F8ECEE6
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0xAFFA8908
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0x750BB957

0x3796A4AC
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x715BC650

0x3796A4AC
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0xC750F96D
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x62AC4FA7
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0x8FA7A123
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xC88CC68F
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0x04F7B59D
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x53E1BCDA
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0xA5D893A8
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x4B4342C1
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0x5BE38E4B
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0x66416164
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x61B74494
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x88E17F27
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x5858FBC6
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0x1C4F24FA
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x1559C70E
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x708F28DA
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0x79C42A08
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x847DA23E
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0xDBD033AB
After this digression he proceeded--
0xF6D2DCA3

0x3796A4AC
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x33C79489
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x3312A626
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0xD6794BE3
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0xF9C04B27
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0x600FE9E0
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x2D42A51C
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0x1A8713A6
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0x9FCF3CAD
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x3F7B1260
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x3093E874
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x6FFDFF35
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xB89D6727
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x32AE1E07
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0x05B7A571
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0xECE2F9CF
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x17B1F356
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0x52E11773
who had been her dupe.
0x6189B476

0x3796A4AC
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0x9200C5D9
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0xCFC6BA05
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0xD540BF30
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x260AC5F9
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0xCD5BF7C6
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xB96B56FB
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x43BC3C04
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0x54F9CABC
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x2C43287B
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x454F3666
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0xE481E4FF

0x3796A4AC
Adele here came running up again.
0x61C19B88

0x3796A4AC
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0xCCB63A15
wishes to see you."
0x7F8E388A

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x0699B455
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x6601E7F0
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x2B9B7A65
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xCA45249A
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0x6846F474
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0xE1A903D8
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x8251F95D
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0xD8233BB3
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x2610938C
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xC5F04811
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xC7BB70B2
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x473F5F32
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0x50F15881
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x6D90E6BA
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x26D6F049
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x7607C941
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0xC4FC8979
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0x509AD759
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xC03BE906
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x63D23248
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0xE4DCEDF1
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x9B0E3C87

0x3796A4AC
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x18B6D502
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0x31BA9998
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x3937FF08
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0x9EE871C7
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0xB9C88144
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0xD78AA3F9

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x1B3BB001
you too: it darkens."
0x4A60B608

0x3796A4AC
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0x7BDC2DF9
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x8C493898
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x0B0916BF
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x9A9DB11B
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0xA1AE054A
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x2894EE0B
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x6062DC90
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x7FDECB92
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0x12FBB971
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0xBBFC2006
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0xA3BEF1C7
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0x74B64DB1

0x3796A4AC
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x7D4269EB
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x2D1D614E
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x6F3C1187
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x1956D68D
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0xD1B5B712
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x779BD175
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0xF2B0F7DE
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0xED1848CE
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x8F738538
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0xDC5903CB
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0xF21D5156
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0xB6758311
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xFEA18562
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x929CF067
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x656D7EF7
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x12CC6D99
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x0F26FDE5
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x0B4DABE8
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x7C056EA3
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0xCF2842F5
benefit.
0x7FFEFA9D

0x3796A4AC
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0xEF1E3A6A
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0xF63EB1DA
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x8B13BEE1
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0x8556BD7B
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x146A013B
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xFDA9180A
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x50267DE1
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x51016B03
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0xDC603310

0x3796A4AC
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x14990221
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x6D71B1E0
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x41C5B087
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0x4909FC60
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0xBBC23232
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x1E716389
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0x5AD2703D
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x2FBD0963

0x3796A4AC
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0xA97B141A
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0xDDE4BAE6
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0x1BFE86C0
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x82DA3D4C
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0x37E7C344
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x6A60837D
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xC2C52B50
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0xD1A80AA9
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0x63EEE9F6
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x2155A6A4
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x69986D3D
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0xB4D0711C
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0xD645A7DF
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0x28806EDF
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0xA26CBDEA
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xA68AEBFB
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x35216575
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x7051AC5A
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0xBA3F5FC1

0x3796A4AC
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0xB49E1F1B
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0xDEDBDC3B
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0x24C9F39F
Thornfield.
0x23EE0DF6

0x3796A4AC
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0xDC356ED6
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x51DF414D
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0xB9D31520
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x5D65D6FC
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0xADB9478C

0x3796A4AC
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x0C6B8158
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x2BD58B2A
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0xE5216C6A
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x96C875F1
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x96E06250

0x3796A4AC
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x3351D00C
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x1051B8CE
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x330F95E7
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x262ADE48
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0xD17DF82F

0x3796A4AC
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xF468FCF5
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x03BECCE1
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x6B876BF9
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0xD54D0490
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xD1237F5A
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x1C8598DE
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xC69F1A13
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0xCDB2587C
enough.
0x973D29C9

0x3796A4AC
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0xBC24C41C
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x5E3EFA27
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x1E1094EB
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x3993BADF
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x5AC35FEB
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0x08A9E86A
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0x3E893D3C
there?"
0x0328D320

0x3796A4AC
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0xB94F9A34
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0xA8825D87
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0xCAF38649

0x3796A4AC
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0xDC077F60
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0x3C7279CE
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0xBB9B6E80
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0xD141C625
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0xDDA12C7C
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0x02285307
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0x5CBF76F4
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0xAE519009
burning.
0x29915A24

0x3796A4AC
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x2DCA0147
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x5504B3E0
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0xA71840BD
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x3A457E3E
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x40A25C77
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x3B212B90

0x3796A4AC
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x8559B7A8
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0xFFD069CF
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xCBD78BBB
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0xF1DA4B8C
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x7AD61E93
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0xF94B2898
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x3A62F0E8

0x3796A4AC
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x7C1055B3
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0x9388A431
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0xDAB23881
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0x43C960C6
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0x3A7339EE
water.
0x3DABB61F

0x3796A4AC
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0xE96ACDA0

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x44E3D5D2
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x8611C01F

0x3796A4AC
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x3FDC1A38
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x1AA2D1C7
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x7D366DF9

0x3796A4AC
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0xAEBE9C27
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x4C1F641B

0x3796A4AC
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0xD4A8A8F5
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x0EF44FAF
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x8FCEF63D

0x3796A4AC
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x0A098A31
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x5ED56526
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xB8C8000D

0x3796A4AC
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x588AFF94
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0xA8C389BD
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x718F67F5
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x48C44BFF
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xDC9FACE4

0x3796A4AC
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0x8C164055

0x3796A4AC
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0xEDAD356F
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0xFE5DCECA

0x3796A4AC
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x049AB8B7

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0x4E5B375B
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x77D7CF49

0x3796A4AC
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xD9FA62B7

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xCCA084C9
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x19973ED4
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x39B50D8A
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0xE08EC79B
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x1183D319
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x915ACF0B
move, remember, or call any one."
0x5F75EBEF

0x3796A4AC
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xBDE8118A
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0xBA388F80
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xDF85B0DD
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0xC1BF006D
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x296DFF7B
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0x93EA4FAB
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xD6F26D76
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x7864C562
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x9EE05701
"and not something worse."
0x285A8126

0x3796A4AC
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x3929A2AF
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0xDC24FC38

0x3796A4AC
"How, sir?"
0xC9E726B3

0x3796A4AC
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x16B7975E
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0x1EFCADBE

0x3796A4AC
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0x33822F27
door."
0x39852C5C

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0x92695BC5

0x3796A4AC
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0x4BD8D5A1
think, or something like it?"
0xE7888C8E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0xAEBB3D4B
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x38905C85

0x3796A4AC
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x7D004402
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0xFE27A574
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x185CC82B
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x8E7ADC27
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x6F847D10
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0xED097512
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0xEB2484AA
hours the servants will be up."
0x8D3B932F

0x3796A4AC
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x71A41838

0x3796A4AC
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xB3435F32
go.
0x298E32ED

0x3796A4AC
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0x8F3B952C

0x3796A4AC
"You said I might go, sir."
0x265D81FA

0x3796A4AC
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x9CB877EA
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0xF7655122
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0x1641460A
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xF4D8DEFE
At least shake hands."
0x8680DE23

0x3796A4AC
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0x295EF123
both his own.
0x038AB408

0x3796A4AC
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x5D7BBE2A
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x964079DC
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x5AF7E308
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x9CC98F0F

0x3796A4AC
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x63C985C3
his voice was checked.
0x3739BF5D

0x3796A4AC
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0xBD3CEC2C
in the case."
0xDC6389CE

0x3796A4AC
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xE3290A9F
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0x90104BA9
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xE481B478
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xF8C8C023
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x3E2E94D8
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x74DC5566

0x3796A4AC
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x08B009DD

0x3796A4AC
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x83C6BB82

0x3796A4AC
"What! you _will_ go?"
0xE9078C3C

0x3796A4AC
"I am cold, sir."
0x259D6CC1

0x3796A4AC
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0xB21E8AD5
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0xD5A7ACCD
expedient.
0x126AEC2F

0x3796A4AC
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x88C0A040

0x3796A4AC
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x9304897B

0x3796A4AC
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0xA46A3264
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0xBA2546A5
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0x4B362B3C
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x6AFBD76E
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0x92CA8FCF
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x6C49CAA7
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0xAF0FE6C6
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x7714E33D

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XVI
0x8EC3B511

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x18AE1F01
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0x50A1A7FF
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x31CDA380
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x36340B4A
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0x59BF6C3D
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0xBCC8A246

0x3796A4AC
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0xA9A979AE
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xA5AF59FC
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0xBD157C64
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0xDBF9C058
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0x30E00434
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x22745CC5
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xC973C2D6
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xEE397C2B
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x378F3335

0x3796A4AC
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0xD604D477
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0xA202965A
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0x061C4EBD
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x3D1A1364
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x48656C9F
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0xC23BE916
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0xC1C6A1F5
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0xDEA7E842
no other than Grace Poole.
0xA7B8D0F9

0x3796A4AC
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0xBA6C3FA6
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x03DE28A6
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0xCD1E4FC0
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xCCE732D5
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0xD2FBB2E9
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x9D0994AE
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0xEAE6A604
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0xE4AB7C02
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x808BE127
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0xCAB6F938
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x9A9B8257
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0xDCBD2E54
went on with her sewing.
0x0DC64EC7

0x3796A4AC
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0xDF3C8E8B
is past comprehension."
0xA29BF5BA

0x3796A4AC
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0xB5788849
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x3BE2BD02

0x3796A4AC
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x0EE8CCE2
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0x74EB0704
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0x18862B9C
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x46907A33

0x3796A4AC
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0xB4ABEF6C
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0xB0A01B85

0x3796A4AC
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x8212F58D
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0xA5FC01CC
she answered--
0x833C32C5

0x3796A4AC
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x83C6F71E
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0xCCE44C96
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x27133D55
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0xA0E9C472
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x3A3B0DAB
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x6A6267A0
a noise?"
0x28FB9E49

0x3796A4AC
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x7F1C0A78
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0xB59A7F66
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0x8B83B85C

0x3796A4AC
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x405D3ADA
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x6F0496BC

0x3796A4AC
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x22DE531A
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x82D36286

0x3796A4AC
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0xDB7FC18C
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x59ADA4B6
conscious eye.
0xDB5E2256

0x3796A4AC
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xEA26932B

0x3796A4AC
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0x4EA1E777

0x3796A4AC
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x4C35BB27
gallery?" she further asked.
0xAFFF6898

0x3796A4AC
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x3B6DC5AA
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x033C6A25
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0xC8F7D762
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0x1658B3D8

0x3796A4AC
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x4CA24050

0x3796A4AC
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x8427CB3B
you get into bed?"
0xC7761618

0x3796A4AC
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x10DFB54D
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x5B03EB05
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0xBDC9E366
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x3B93678A
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x5677C774
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x5B9332F5
lie down."
0x246DE89E

0x3796A4AC
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x560D7CF6
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0x5B0878F4
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0x641A53AC
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0x2843B7FD
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x696A2A16
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x5C20C305
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0xE0265469
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0xF06E532C
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x1440C682
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0x299D0AED
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x440DBBFC
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0xBA9D0210
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x1B615F5C

0x3796A4AC
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0xAA311FA4
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0xAF7B10C8
entered.
0xFC364DBC

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x33B3F63A
be ready: will you come down?"
0x0F1E85B8

0x3796A4AC
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x1648646F
carry it upstairs."
0xBE084C65

0x3796A4AC
"You'll have some meat?"
0x984BAFC3

0x3796A4AC
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0xAA843BE2

0x3796A4AC
"And the sago?"
0x246EF8D9

0x3796A4AC
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0xC8652A3E
make it myself."
0x06FA45DB

0x3796A4AC
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x37B4E538
so I departed.
0x7D7CE292

0x3796A4AC
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x22657BA6
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x6CF200FE
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0xDB56ECF4
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x8D1F865B
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0xA6747D9D
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xCC2CC833
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x47C75F65
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x8374C649
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x3A7AEA18
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xBD4A6663
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0xDBCB00CC
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x7B4F93D6

0x3796A4AC
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0xEB1C8085
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x1FE7614D
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xC18C219A
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x01BE732E
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0xA57628A7
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x4FF50345
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x41659BC1
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xA072B3BB
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x7E6527BC
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x0DF3AF6C
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xBC75DA89
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0x50A2AFEB
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0x20D3CE4C
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0xB5FD3639
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x2F94D264
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x6CBEAF6D
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0xCBB7F27E
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x4D4CC3C5
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x923AC15E
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xB1C8B426

0x3796A4AC
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x5831B7D7
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x47BD4E85
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x29535E53

0x3796A4AC
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x80726A65
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xB6146127

0x3796A4AC
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xBC37E26C
thinking.
0xF0306216

0x3796A4AC
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x6CC6D40D
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xDA69BC1A
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x97D0ECFC
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xCD04AAA9
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x42B26E88
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0x71AF2D58

0x3796A4AC
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xB9086686
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x3432CF05
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xC43A57ED
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x8BBD9E08
impatient."
0xC0DED130

0x3796A4AC
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0xA7091A05
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x798FFC5D
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0xBBA327B8
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x68135CFF
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0xD25103F5
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x1FB24CD4
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x07D4BE99
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x2A1174A0
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0xF4ADC990
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0xB036D842
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x7321E4C3
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0xCEDD83EB
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x9D48051A
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x0ABEF2A2
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xBE9E90F4
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0x719E8155
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0x227AD549
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x72054766
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0xFE84141F

0x3796A4AC
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0xD619DF3A
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0xC3BBCA5A
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0xEF724969
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x479F2992

0x3796A4AC
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0xD1A24B2B
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0x54F845DC
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x6322535D

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x1DC9F9CA

0x3796A4AC
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x7E119B13
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0xE336EDAB
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x656926AF
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x762093E4
deepening into total obscurity.
0xC4ED34A9

0x3796A4AC
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0x82E3BF28
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x903C283F
his journey."
0x8E56F61F

0x3796A4AC
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0xD7E92D2C

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x07F49AE1
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0xB5528038
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x424EF1CE
Colonel Dent, and others."
0xD67CC1DE

0x3796A4AC
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x34FD0AD0

0x3796A4AC
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0x57D67C86
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0x400E93D6
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x6D226A71
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x23A2F7CE
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0x2C98A047
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0x00B49EEF
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0xE96FA38F
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x74F16F3D
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0x362B26D8
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x9EF13E0C

0x3796A4AC
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0x7248B65E

0x3796A4AC
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x1C925E86
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0xA1559DFE
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x2E0D5937
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0xBF3150B3
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x4D41F338
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0x84AB69F4
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0xDC7FC149
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xD7BF440C
the evening."
0x1093E30A

0x3796A4AC
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0xDB1AD095

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x3AF0F61B
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0x8A17EDBA
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0x009944B9
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x0D953419
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x99385CA9
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x591807F5
was certainly the queen."
0xA3019238

0x3796A4AC
"And what was she like?"
0x58CBADB3

0x3796A4AC
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xAE6514D9
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x32E27ACF
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0x5A439B92
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0xD8D3AD71
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x5F02D0EF
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0x0320BBBD
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x46F0EAD6
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x4F578D7A
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x6B9C7B68
jetty mass of her curls."
0x3D889120

0x3796A4AC
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x3C8C3AF9

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0xA5BC8A40
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x31E525C2
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0xECEC966C

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0xB5B2406D

0x3796A4AC
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0xD962BE17

0x3796A4AC
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0xB68E7399

0x3796A4AC
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0x3F1AB4AC
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0xD38FA397
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x691EE847

0x3796A4AC
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0xEEE52B51

0x3796A4AC
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0x8D6231B9
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0xA33BA253
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0xD607B838

0x3796A4AC
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0xD0859819
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x7A7E3303

0x3796A4AC
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x7817DF1D
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0x521139AE

0x3796A4AC
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0x5B8E9586

0x3796A4AC
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0xAACB8663
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0x9A173E80
began tea."
0xDA27953B

0x3796A4AC
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0xA7438233

0x3796A4AC
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x2E5DA64E
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x2DFFDE94
conversation was turned into another channel.
0xA9648820

0x3796A4AC
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0xF5ABAF2E
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x5DB5EEC9
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x16457162
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0x06F0B0C3

0x3796A4AC
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0xE4AF0706
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x42654149
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x424F5216
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x44FDCD98
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0xBB2B66D1
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x69CE590C

0x3796A4AC
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0xE6D75EDB
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x02AE450A
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x82E8BAA7

0x3796A4AC
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0x64C5CBF1
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0xAF1AC597
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x12307B92
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0xD203BA33
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0xCBE6FF6E
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x9D492362
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0x81324B5E
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0xAC2754DD
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0x075B7870
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0x66C687D8
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x2830F65C
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0xD4B65BDD
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0xFA89CF9A
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x8634FDCF
is no extrication.
0xB48CAAD4

0x3796A4AC
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x44E9A553
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xAE3A97F7
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x83773AA0
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x07002E44
poor, and plain.'
0xF95F320C

0x3796A4AC
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0x5A67B551
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xC11A9A7A
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x8CFA484F
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0x5F133EA1
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x62540198
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x8C13FA3A
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0xC300E4D1
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0xA0F2EBDE
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x6E9F880C
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x836801FA
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x9D24DC7D
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0x79511D85
accomplished lady of rank.'
0x1A3E6168

0x3796A4AC
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0xFE90E25F
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x3AC20141
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0xFB7D90E4
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x2A4117B9
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0xAFE6EFC6

0x3796A4AC
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x771E79D3
calm, and fell asleep.
0x643A87A7

0x3796A4AC
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0xACC785BF
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0xFAE04355
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0xB5FF5183
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x65C36D3C
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x766FEFCB
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0xA4C3405D
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x25AFB1A9

0x3796A4AC
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x7DB61E03
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0xEB533B24
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x18B9D4B9
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0xA03CD848
maintain, even externally.

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XVII
0xA683F30D

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xE62226F2
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0x39F19471
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xD1035BFF
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xAA56F3D8
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0x117EE430
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x7F67D614
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0xDD0EA008
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x32EAC53B
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0x2F04DE7A
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0xCCDE5725
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0xB3F0C62D
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0x9322C2B5
on the contrary, I just said--
0x48849257

0x3796A4AC
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x1F1AEE23
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x0689F05B
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xACB9725F
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x2640E8FF
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x5864886F
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0x3E4AB0FD
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0xF73E1B13
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0xEED855F0
wanted and would be despised."
0xC917BEAC

0x3796A4AC
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0x30D56661
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x32B4775B
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0xC71277C1
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x6315227F
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0xB03B8C05

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0xD0196E1D
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0xAA1433A6

0x3796A4AC
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x71116803
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x2D4DEFDD

0x3796A4AC
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x8E061D09
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0xBE5FC7A0
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x30D252F8
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0xFAFD324F
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0xA6946F1A

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x7839B943
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0xBFB06955
holding the note before her spectacles.
0xE814710A

0x3796A4AC
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x14FD103F
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x665B885E
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0x07B3C7F2

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x390A1543

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0xDEE368E5
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0xC4B057F5
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x1AB002F3
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0xC9C946B3
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0xA888A881
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x5D348417
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x427AA055
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x851603A2

0x3796A4AC
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x3885CC32
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x0C7B5894
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x1FD36204
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x820815F7
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0xEFDF1E83
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xDB232FD9
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0xC49AAC65
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0xBFB6381C
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x562D33F0
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x937BAADF
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x22F622BA
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0xE9EEDD46
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x4FF14955
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x9408A5A8
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x68333C83
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0x59D3D9BB
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x672B2160
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0xF3CD9CEB

0x3796A4AC
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0xC1B32762
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0xC25792BE
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x00E96269
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0xAFAC4769
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0xBFBB42C5
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0xE688D65B
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0xB43D5CC0
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0xFDCA32EE
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0x41CB75C6
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0xD9F35B64
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x50D2DBD3
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x7A51B428
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0xEEA45481
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x968A9443
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0xCEF76A24
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0x092F434E
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x971A2B16
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x8688F606
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x8E737E52
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x0981DE52

0x3796A4AC
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0xC7668204
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0xEB725194
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x063D40EC
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0xC51D77C6
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x64A5A8A4
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x6824AD7C

0x3796A4AC
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x290927DB

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0xD74819A5
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x60E20759
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0xE2AA8169
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0x5606AD25
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x4F556DA5
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xD02ADDC9
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x48C28E79

0x3796A4AC
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x59AC133F

0x3796A4AC
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0xBED7687C
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0x40642B6E
the money she gets."
0xD4C1B55F

0x3796A4AC
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0xBBD9742D

0x3796A4AC
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0xF95A0B53
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0x69F64276

0x3796A4AC
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x5BFB0135

0x3796A4AC
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0xE0AFD309
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0xC710E34B
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x9AC455F9
excluded.
0x956781A0

0x3796A4AC
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0x9E17765B
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x208FFEFF
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xC004B69C
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x790BF9A2
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x6B374B3B
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x336A06F6
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x7420E094
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0x021568D4
sides.
0x9B6CCDB5

0x3796A4AC
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x9AF8C259
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xA6A958DE
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x16754BC6
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0xEED21E8F
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0x631ED949
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x75676E2B
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0xF84A573C
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x4BDC193D
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0x2907C496

0x3796A4AC
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x7E991938
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x3C704F8D
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x7C0F8DA0
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0xD4D53D7D

0x3796A4AC
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0xE1F0DBA1
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0xE0D3119E
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xB110B45F
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x6FE1603E
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0xC36E204C
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x9575B099

0x3796A4AC
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x1C93EFAD
minutes."
0x66B6F24C

0x3796A4AC
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x1F5F5F68
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x64ECB5AB

0x3796A4AC
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x8A81C2A5
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x7B090538
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x6EEF5402
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0x2BA0F685
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0xE5B48022
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0x823E8799
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x1C82A1C4
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0xAF5664A5
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0x566E940F

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0x31872C9C
below.
0x7DD9F1E4

0x3796A4AC
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0xCFBE3ED8
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x7DE27B6C
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0xB489EAEE
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0xB57C3B65
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0xCA235052
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x6058AA44
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0xC091211F

0x3796A4AC
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x3344A737
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0xE4325748
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0x4B903A6C
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0xAE3847CD
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x828458E0
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x19FA3994
and, for a time, a hush.
0xE97F552D

0x3796A4AC
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x7487EA8D
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x40B87C88

0x3796A4AC
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xB39E8213
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x4EE036C1
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0x39C5164A
on apprend."
0x36900D57

0x3796A4AC
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0xC9803920

0x3796A4AC
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xF5626666
mange."
0x7C90926D

0x3796A4AC
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0x0EEB6C13
get you something to eat."
0xF1BCB449

0x3796A4AC
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x01DC2524
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0x165207A4
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x2D8176E5
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xBB970BF6
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x60B3AFE7
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x455F2AC8
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x90D72139
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0xD1398091
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x38DEC402
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0xB40F81D4
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0xBEB2DCBE
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x8C2E5385
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xE96FB849
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0x3D63E82D
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x75261705
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x56A47313
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x65B9FF4E

0x3796A4AC
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0xDF68647A
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x63A51D23
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x8CB1757F
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0xE1D8A366
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x419C5A8A
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0xFC10DE01
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x0F1D5138

0x3796A4AC
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x97B7611E
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x0AD1991A
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x2ED3E908
dinner?"
0x57468EBA

0x3796A4AC
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0x8DDED1A6
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0xB5A81478
is your dinner."
0xC3A9BF4A

0x3796A4AC
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x138DC3DC
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x38893626
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x43AB9E32
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x31290C78
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x4E495CAD
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0xBDB4BB35
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x6DB179D4
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0xA9D4D0F7
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xEF08DC20
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0xA08078CC
quel dommage!"
0x5DD13E02

0x3796A4AC
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x53E5286E
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x57E51824
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0xB50AD111
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xB0F32613
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x1649D9E4
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x51D37C14
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x82C52D4E
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x6C0880C1
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0xB7A8387B
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x665977C5
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x50565B7E
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x15D8F0A4
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x2694F41E
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xC40AC8D8

0x3796A4AC
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x1DFA1D30
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x9753A0D4
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x2DBC40CD
sought their chambers.
0x71F848A2

0x3796A4AC
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0x7DAD509F
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0x7F70E4BB
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x6F5BF947
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x613462C3
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x63EEDA20
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0xE31922C0
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x210BA4F2

0x3796A4AC
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x068F3D7C
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0xDE5B7D96
ladies."
0xB01EC427

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x81A3F6CE

0x3796A4AC
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0xBDC175E9
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0x89992880
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0xEBBAD99A

0x3796A4AC
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x056FED28
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0xC973256B
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x5A823291
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xE6604691

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0xB12BC2C0
answered.
0x6E08E4EE

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x7DF1F66C
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x2C6C63BF
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0xD5920CBC
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0x96E13C8E
case of contumacy.'"
0x2E2D2478

0x3796A4AC
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x2825E12A
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x2FD0C026

0x3796A4AC
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x2183A5C0
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xE91BD88B
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xFEDC9EAC
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0xF2599576
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xBF69341B
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0xD889E606
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x8E43A950

0x3796A4AC
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x078F6131

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0xFBFF892F
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x39E914D9
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x60A327EC
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0xCA6A4986
stay at Thornfield."
0x1523D97E

0x3796A4AC
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x12FE21A1
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x965479D8
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0x639B5834
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x11B0F88D
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x0EFEF11E
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x2254AAF7
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xC8E37D8E
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0xCCDE4A20
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0x67790C1F
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0x8A1009F9
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0xB463C54F
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0x927889EC
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0xC9E43795
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0x62C3DF60
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x519F1941
descended.
0x7150B729

0x3796A4AC
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x90522A9D
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x4A187695
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0xA948A0C0
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0xF99A01EF
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xAA191A58
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0xC786903C
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x73CA8313
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0xAB3C994A

0x3796A4AC
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0xA3575EB7
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xEAEE0EC4
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0xFF3C2930
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xCBD0A334
touched my knee.
0x4D4DD4B8

0x3796A4AC
"What is it, Adele?"
0x8E4EDE8B

0x3796A4AC
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x7E03D503
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0xD1E887F4

0x3796A4AC
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x81C87FE6
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0xA4AE75D1
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x0D4285B7
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x6054A354
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0xFB4AE3F4
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0xD63BB22C

0x3796A4AC
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0x30594451
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0xB248E091
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x6960AB29
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x8D7E0E19
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x2701F41B

0x3796A4AC
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x06CED691
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xAEF41708
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x4386A357
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0xF219F962
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0xE1ACFC91
stared at me.
0xB5B9ACAF

0x3796A4AC
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x091074CB
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xC7200DD0
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x4326E2A4
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x9A1268CF
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x34D13224
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x3290BA14
and may as well mention them now.
0xA1FD0733

0x3796A4AC
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0x4A24C92D
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0xF8BE3CB1
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xE55766EE
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0xA241268D
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x380BB91B
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0xDD30BBE4
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x47C2B4AD

0x3796A4AC
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x2482F7AA
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0xF36A71C1
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x090D6100
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x14E62582

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0x90E5D8FC
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0x481B6083
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0xD01A5BB6
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xAF48C286

0x3796A4AC
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0xF9542036
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0xA736343D
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x2B67528E
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x44FF0D9E
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x41F11448
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0xE3FC35FF
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0x7AACF635
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x0D4554B9
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x321EBE0C
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x02F3A2A1
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0xF5FDC5F8
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xB679FF98
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x45688E3D
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x86ED8E59
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xF313C8F0
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x755EF2E9
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0x47EAF996
truly imperial dignity.
0xE150AE0F

0x3796A4AC
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0xF193C577
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x7430CBAD
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x0F8D8B00
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0x2DEE7483
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xEDBED991
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0xF733A340
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x6C491D78

0x3796A4AC
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0xAB495A19
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0xA9AAAF8A
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x2B3E1052
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xEE35E8B9
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0xE05FE3E5
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0xEBC8625D
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0xA3DCB8A3
haughty lip.
0x070D96DA

0x3796A4AC
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0xC79D0156
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x3EC12414
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x9B9B6E08
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x4732D547
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x49F6516D
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xB47FB9F6
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x6FDB3D8E
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x6FDB88E7
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x3F212CF1
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0x0659A837
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x0FA8FA00

0x3796A4AC
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0xC7EC4886
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x96ABB13F
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x2C2D6409
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0x371E1DDF
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0xAD706EE5
in spotless white.
0x4A00C6CB

0x3796A4AC
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0x67B4CBEF
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0xAA01B405
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x7A918C2F
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0xEB9B682A
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0xA3ED140C
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0xB565EBB0
together.
0x2981BC9E

0x3796A4AC
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0xF4BDE3DB
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x3A2D8BD3
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0xF851EDF4
gravity--
0x6F68250E

0x3796A4AC
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0x0E8CCEED

0x3796A4AC
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x04EFA873
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0x8B9B5047

0x3796A4AC
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x664406F1
little French girl he was speaking of."
0xC4C74205

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x70EAAAAD

0x3796A4AC
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x1CEC8BB8
child!"
0xECA1EEB2

0x3796A4AC
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xDCCC83CC
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0xE05324B2
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0xBFD59DA4
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x8CE1E82A

0x3796A4AC
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xF9123D90
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x2DCC10F3
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0xC60AF21A
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xE4BE8EFB
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0xC3D7E945
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x632A06CE
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0xC689F7F9
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x751EFF2E
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0xFC96F4E3
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x9774B6D1
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x9F330E24
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0x88479A03
blood or vigour of brain.
0x121B6702

0x3796A4AC
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x56F2D085

0x3796A4AC
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0xD46EA74E
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x3862CBDE
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0xF732F358
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0xA6A2F5FC
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x0F0D6B5A
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x9CE20D96
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0xEAA97EF2
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0x38669257
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0xB6EA7DFE
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xFCE4C39F
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x00D04183
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xCAF24823
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x520629C1
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x348F949D

0x3796A4AC
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0xA998390F
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x8067A23F
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x99B9D6BE
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0xD57F7D8F
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0xF6763C93
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0xCE6F6933
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0x1C2DB3DC
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0xC8BADD6E

0x3796A4AC
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x474250A6
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0xCDE8965E
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x82E959F7
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0xA1DA65C0
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0xE6A3283B
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x60AC2B00
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0xB5179210
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x5A5588DC
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x19029C50
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x14181859

0x3796A4AC
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0xB18D0CE4
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0x157A569E
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0xEE58A699
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x331B8FB0
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0xAC3E4687
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xF1980048
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x8EC19C80
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0xE4F56CAB
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x7F5B5964
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0xC4945626
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x3895E06A
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x509B72F3
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0xA4876F1B
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x3316F0B3
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x8950A531
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0x820E4BB8
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0x46A1E9EE
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0x1038A4C3
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0xE793E498
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x78DEE205
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x3013DDBA
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0xA555E949
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x27EA9295
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xDD0D48AF
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0x2F00FF04
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0xC25D6E05
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x276C96CB
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0xF9B5248B
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xB290370A

0x3796A4AC
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x813B76EF
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x83A1F78B
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x8D4916E6
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0xA95F8E6C
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x544DB11E
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0xDD7193BB
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xC24CDEB3
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x328E3652
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0xB9C87F01
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x811E95AB
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x8CBF5561
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0x1BB6222A
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0x41D955E5
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x7827E711
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0xE17BEE83
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xB971DD76
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x8E05606F
selects a mate.
0x0A920759

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x436E8E98
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x2C30274F
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0x19B870A6

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x07CD2F9D

0x3796A4AC
"Nor am I."
0x02C3C70C

0x3796A4AC
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x689C5CBB
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x97607493

0x3796A4AC
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0xD931984E

0x3796A4AC
"You should have sent her to school."
0xCA150AA2

0x3796A4AC
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0x0764DBF9

0x3796A4AC
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0xDEC6FA1D
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x356C9051
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x7F41646B
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0xD80539AD

0x3796A4AC
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xF58E36C0
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x6BE54171
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0xA5FAD8F2

0x3796A4AC
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0x56FB29F0
straight before him.
0x46E61441

0x3796A4AC
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0xF4E82F7D
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0x6BD80FE0
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x4F150E4E
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x8B90C598

0x3796A4AC
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x16031C6F

0x3796A4AC
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x427F504D
her question with an explanation.
0x220DDBC7

0x3796A4AC
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0x1E3572E4
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0xEE3BB2E4
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0x019BF917

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0x9984E075
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0x9B996257
the anathematised race was present.
0xEF5A3E85

0x3796A4AC
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0x3536F407
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0xEBCE1085
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x9CA802FA

0x3796A4AC
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0x221902DD

0x3796A4AC
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x6AE634A7
three times with portentous significancy.
0xE7834D2F

0x3796A4AC
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0xB91E3C66

0x3796A4AC
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0x718D871E

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x67CF117C
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0xF26B2B12
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0xCBF61780
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x272BE948
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x412A9D8B
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x4B979AFC
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x5B01AAED
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x48AF1ABE
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x7FF391C5
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x32D8E280
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0xAB347EEE
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0x2DBF9F07

0x3796A4AC
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0xAFDC8C05
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x01AF21EE
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0xF64674BE
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x514267AE

0x3796A4AC
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x51E00148
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x7249A0BF
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0xABE77FA6
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x3CE35B17
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0x44D0EFBC
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0x4CFFC19F
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xBA60D8C2
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0xFFAFFED9
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0x7B5509A1
lady-mother?"
0xE12957AD

0x3796A4AC
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0x7EFDE922
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0xFE845C97
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0x74D2AB04

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0x1226A7B1
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0x7A122F26
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0x9B80CF37
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0xB7F32078
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0xDAB5E0BA

0x3796A4AC
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0x838A1027

0x3796A4AC
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0x08A10633

0x3796A4AC
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x5EF8CA84
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0xB89B5B95
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x9917A197
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0x9A593122

0x3796A4AC
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0xCFE769BA
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0xDFCEFD5C
she would give us anything we asked for."
0x72288AEF

0x3796A4AC
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0x1A0690A3
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0x6DCD024E
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0xD1051CDE
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0x870CF674

0x3796A4AC
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0xC078D560

0x3796A4AC
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0xE7268EFA
in voice to-night?"
0xEF0061E1

0x3796A4AC
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0xDA0C8628

0x3796A4AC
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0x61DCAF5B
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x290E399F

0x3796A4AC
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0xD9F742CC

0x3796A4AC
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0xB25B694B
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xFAD429AD
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x706233C6
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0xB38AC7FC
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0xBF09EE91
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xFEED1B76
hand."
0x9D7EE3A8

0x3796A4AC
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0xA7A882CE
Mr. Rochester.
0xCD16BA00

0x3796A4AC
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0x87F35C60

0x3796A4AC
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0x92114487

0x3796A4AC
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x862F79B9
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x9E535B0A
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x89DE1115
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x7926A9E7
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0xC74F6BCD
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0xC820F596

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x22D7377D
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0xFAF17BEB
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0x23B987C6
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0xF578A9B8
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x153E33A5
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0xD29F084B
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x7A8A4892
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x54D9420D
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0xEA91A31A
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x88147F54
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0xF343E812

0x3796A4AC
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x7DAA9711
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0xCAD386AA
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0xFAB62816
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0x509DDB20
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0xB90EF6E7

0x3796A4AC
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x70121428

0x3796A4AC
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0x4EB3D3CE
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0xA7079033

0x3796A4AC
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0xC4E29FBD
water."
0x89256F18

0x3796A4AC
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0xF668C0B6
such things _should_ be done."
0xE806FCD1

0x3796A4AC
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0xDFA311AF
fail."
0x43C4F008

0x3796A4AC
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0x0341EF84
proportionate punishment."
0xA529A976

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x5195BB67
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0x680BE82A

0x3796A4AC
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xCFB77360

0x3796A4AC
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0x3900EE3E
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0xCA63C069
capital punishment."
0x66FB24A7

0x3796A4AC
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x8CE961A4
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x43918319

0x3796A4AC
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x5E45D6B9
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0xFC032D09
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0x3602BEE6
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0x78E8C8AB
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0xB5079F6C
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x414A23C7
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x0BE626ED
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0xC2DE24CE
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x6F1FE759
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0xEBC736AE
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xC66A80E7
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x189756D0

0x3796A4AC
"How do you do?" he asked.
0xDE193B42

0x3796A4AC
"I am very well, sir."
0x06B0CE7F

0x3796A4AC
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x791DA59E

0x3796A4AC
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x704162CD
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x7B87F1CF

0x3796A4AC
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x1EC8EB28

0x3796A4AC
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x2CB36D8F

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x6B6E7663

0x3796A4AC
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x70BF5CEE
What is the matter?"
0xAC0F90A1

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x4FD9921E

0x3796A4AC
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x6FC5601F

0x3796A4AC
"Not the least."
0xBFDA30C7

0x3796A4AC
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x8545AC0F

0x3796A4AC
"I am tired, sir."
0x667B2A6B

0x3796A4AC
He looked at me for a minute.
0x79AC1A27

0x3796A4AC
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x23C9C5E9

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x46AAD038

0x3796A4AC
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0xE468328B
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x899532C9
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0xA39008C9
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x9851480C
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0x470955AE
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x171DC6A3
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x6DC33C8E
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x0A1DAB64
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

CHAPTER XVIII
0xC2911BAC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0xF340935C
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x2EACFB61
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0xE5A771E5
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x565FC5AC
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x21C53DFE
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x60CA1D8A
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x79C829A1

0x3796A4AC
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xB2C88204
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0x81D05318
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0xCAD6B2A7
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x5CAC0993
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0x95BA1B3D
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x38043FDE
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x6228B42D

0x3796A4AC
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0xFF4729F1
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x26954068
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x57923C23
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0xDF077631
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xF12E03F3
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x7FFE3DC6
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0xB262D649
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0xBCD633C5
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x71DC417D
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0xEAAA91DB
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x6202C869
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0xC8D243E2
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0xE0C7DD64
drawing-room.
0x67808FE3

0x3796A4AC
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x49B9CD0F
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0x95AC9597
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0xF39770C5
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0xCDE60767
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0xB9745F01

0x3796A4AC
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0x1786631F
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0xEBB23DBF
usual seat.
0x9B9B5118

0x3796A4AC
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x89EC85C5
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0x99969C0F
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0x9AE0D556
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x5ACC6F3A

0x3796A4AC
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x38E4A6CB

0x3796A4AC
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0x6EA46C59
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0xD784021E
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xD4D18BA2
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0xCC41CF7A
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0x1DBDB159
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x51118BD8
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x4B06651C
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xFF3CEDE0
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x93F72E0B
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x3584025B
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x9A924B40
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0xE6AA3BE8
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x8943E6A8
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0xC15E7189
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x51468C77

0x3796A4AC
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0x8B8D5BE7

0x3796A4AC
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0x7B7D6FA0
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x85EB15AC
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0xF8F89480
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x7135C104
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0xEA22B20A
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x1EE483F1
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0xBA290929
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x8382B757

0x3796A4AC
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0xF32514E9
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0xCC65BC3B
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x30E277F4
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0xFFD3B401
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0x463FFACD
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x9B507479
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x7C85F376
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0xD0568F76
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0xC0C92D56
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0xFB743B44
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0xB7218A1A
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x632DBDD4

0x3796A4AC
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0xA741FDCA
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0xC1BD2972
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x91B0DD3B
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xA3405BAA
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x362DFF0B
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xE81D2309
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x06614545
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0xB568911C
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x93392F31
wanting.
0xFB1439E9

0x3796A4AC
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x31D5413F
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x03D23227
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0xE3EDCB55
curtain again descended.
0xD3659284

0x3796A4AC
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0xB5229D3B
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0xCAC72E8E
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0xAF684343
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0xC56E1F58
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0x36A29F74

0x3796A4AC
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x87AE1C2F
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x27CDADD8
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0x967CD2B9
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xC361F62F
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0x2CECB461
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x76B25C6B
attached fetters.
0x3279C688

0x3796A4AC
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0x0B65AAFD

0x3796A4AC
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x806834AA
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0xA4658C9D
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x44C5050E

0x3796A4AC
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x57758B9A
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x96AE6C59
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x46D288EE

0x3796A4AC
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x95C030F3

0x3796A4AC
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x8ED2AC1D
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0xEBEC8AB2

0x3796A4AC
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0xD6DDF8D2

0x3796A4AC
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x6AD2CFB2
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x16B224D2

0x3796A4AC
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0x90DBE94F
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xA21B5BEB
colour rose.
0x83C11EAF

0x3796A4AC
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0x67FE0EC5
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x5DC4BA6A
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0x5EF021BB
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x9030D0D5
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x5EF596ED
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0xEFC3D1FA
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0xD25E76D8
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0xD62E2DD7
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0x9950001E
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0xDDCD30B9
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xF3A278A2
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x0FC7FFA2
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0x1A303016
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x9F081E34
returns in memory at this moment.
0xD8145A2F

0x3796A4AC
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0x530AF9A5
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0xB1CC9E19
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x9C8DBFDE
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x37420E21
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0xC21ADD0A
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x17A8609D
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0xDC0EDB9C
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0xDF88A0B3
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0x9EC8FDF3
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x0AE549F5
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x7F9C3601
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0x6E22BE09
very pride, irresistible.
0x20871244

0x3796A4AC
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xB4429F86
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0xD6B337C2
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x38EB20A9
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0xD845FEC2
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x7970981D
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0x457085C0
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xEB423B3C
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x96B6A0CE
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0xD5990440
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0xDD69C400
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x79A00CDB
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0x3AEB94A1
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x672951EC
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0xA7890617
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x90D5533F
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xAEE7F440
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x38992129
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x30F687D3
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0x08E17846
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x598B4ED8
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0xAD87B1FD
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x0A904EE1
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x2DD00A6D
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x3DCD358C
torturing pain arose.
0x66EC5683

0x3796A4AC
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x8C10C3EA
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0xDC14296E
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0x4B3508E1
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x7F772A50
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0xA36B919D
not charm him_.
0x58EEECF2

0x3796A4AC
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x2CB97B5D
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0xBF232B6E
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x2E889053
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0xCA76F759
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0xA0B081B2
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0xD14323F9
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x3222595B
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x1F6DF097
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0xDED0A5EF
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x813B10C9
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0xB306478F
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xFE467867
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0xF235E82B
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0xC9C98919
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0xBA296B5A

0x3796A4AC
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0x287F36C3
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xDA7E2FF5
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0x71001EA1
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0xFD1E80AB
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x8ABB1CF9
silent conquest might have been won.
0x7B0A021A

0x3796A4AC
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0x556B43FF
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0x890C211B
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x940F331C
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x76360999
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xB546DEFF
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xE7975C8A
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0x1CCDA500
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x8891754E
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0x529712FF
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xE0390065
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x875196EF
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x9DDBFA94
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0x9A051550
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x931FD0C5
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0xC82B4D0C
shines on."
0x288049E3

0x3796A4AC
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x5BFE0230
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x69508177
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xFD8E5BBF
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0x398E0DF1
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0xA0D60E39
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x6E8FE175
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0xDCCFD7CE
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x69BD28D6
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0xAFFBD3DF
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x1AFF4505
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xCB7FCB02
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x4A43741F
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x5C8ED44F
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x27F43108
as I wished to act.
0x2121777F

0x3796A4AC
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x9DEE8388
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x9E3B68B4
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0xAC6D41E0
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0xFD4FF704
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0xBE90EFF3
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x5CBC456E
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x97C213EB
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x8731BB00
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0xCB756BB1
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x2FCC151D
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0xDD11025A
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x0C89B609
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0xBA00625F
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0xAB741809
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x46E8113E
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x3F6904E3
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x5E2CB9DE
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x56D94163
nature.
0x4A7B4268

0x3796A4AC
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x452CA879
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xFDE470A4
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0xDBE2F287
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0xAABC22C7
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x84D7CA5D
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x8D70BBA9
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0x84E99B2E
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x1E693B03
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0xB1D81AA5
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xF52090CA
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x75E7ACC8
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x401CC66F
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0xFF49CF74
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xF3B01FD5
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x65A8A954
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x2211A610
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x8D3995FD
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x037F16FD
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x635B9737
vivacity of conversation.
0x709C93D4

0x3796A4AC
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x0D235D03
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0xF897C2F7
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x7CF7306E
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x796A45D7
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x5FB41224
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0xFEF67631
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x96096CD6
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0x30D0D0C7
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0x72278737
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0x10B87B65
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0xB186273F
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x199EEEF1
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xF55FDEAE
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x8D75680A
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0xE34C34FA

0x3796A4AC
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x293E15FF
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0x6C0F2F2A
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x4211CA74

0x3796A4AC
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x8194F314

0x3796A4AC
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0xFEBCC78B
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x1DC999BE
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0x66B59320
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x27938588

0x3796A4AC
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0xCB2C58EF
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x13A52599
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x5F0568F9

0x3796A4AC
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x3D44745A
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0xA9F742F9
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x80420DA1
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x1874ABC7
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0xD2BB8301
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0xD3A98ED9
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0x4F7CDA5A

0x3796A4AC
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x21A739D8
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0xBE222871
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0x97987559

0x3796A4AC
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0x688D3154
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xF588C9EA

0x3796A4AC
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0x123FC0F0
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x8799B624
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x56FA9C4A
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0xF300469F

0x3796A4AC
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0xB43C3896
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x3C4EBCFC
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x2DB6C4E8
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x186C2C02
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x3134B4A0
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x631005F6
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0xF2138E2B
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0xB0E0053B
least so I thought.
0x49CC2E99

0x3796A4AC
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0xAC46EA37
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0x332F2FC8
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x36918B20
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xB3E56CCE
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0x549DDF5D
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0x4C6B1463
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x9E14415C
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0xE76DCBEF
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xADE612B2
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0x95331DE4

0x3796A4AC
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x2B421953
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0xE4D05FC4
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0xB78E5F8F
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0xE70B5331
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x8FBBE1F2
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x88663F28
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0xE4347201

0x3796A4AC
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xBF27CCF3
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x64625CD8
that "extremes meet."
0x95A00E83

0x3796A4AC
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0xF84FD38F
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x813EDEA5
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x2AD7173E
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x94B00EA6
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x8558B9BA
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x67F5CD5C
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x89894BA4
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0xE31AB056

0x3796A4AC
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x3766A8E7
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x8B374FCA
a placid eye and smile!"
0x3B5EFA79

0x3796A4AC
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0xBE27A85C
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x9956EC53
Hay Common.
0x0252D942

0x3796A4AC
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0xAFBA6995
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x08F88373
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0x361AC72F
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x42B190FC
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0xEBD80786
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0x756871DC
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x744093A9
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xB57FD171
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x6E844BF2
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0xED614541
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x6A221EC8
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0x7EE227FD
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0xA5159E64

0x3796A4AC
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x21890833
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x32AD0269
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0xE3A51C0C
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0x3F7B89BE
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x53299FDE
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x9D5BFF03
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0x46B980C0

0x3796A4AC
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0xFFA81DF8
off," replied the magistrate.
0x63755BEE

0x3796A4AC
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0xC87F93B3
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x457F852E
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x6C1DFD93
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0x285188D2
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0x0B6102ED
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xF7CE8C01
see her?"
0x04FBDBCD

0x3796A4AC
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x8AE586AB
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x857F61F7

0x3796A4AC
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0xE4C8D793
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0xF19E8726
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x2AA37E41
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x7E91915F

0x3796A4AC
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x2018CEC6

0x3796A4AC
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0xA7523EE0
must and will do it."
0x195E0514

0x3796A4AC
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0xDC40E80E

0x3796A4AC
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0xE553A910

0x3796A4AC
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xF9A70C5D
in, of course."
0x631315B9

0x3796A4AC
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x8CC14BC8
throw away such a chance of fun."
0x5A67E5D9

0x3796A4AC
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x29C7B827

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x75E43777
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xB8F7F3A0

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0xFB31E7D7
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0xE52FA3E5
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x3E378AE4
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x14A81EB5
forward."
0x56621716

0x3796A4AC
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0xBA24EBAF

0x3796A4AC
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x7044477F
Sam!"
0x1C36DA1B

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x25A0CD8A
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x0932FEDB

0x3796A4AC
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0xD2CA6163

0x3796A4AC
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x89CF7CDC

0x3796A4AC
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0xE034734A
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xC3C84D21

0x3796A4AC
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x9E948543
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x8E817F95
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x281A0EB8
one."
0x2B108A94

0x3796A4AC
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0xF75EC1BD
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x4EB34312

0x3796A4AC
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x9861A505
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x10CC05A1
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0xB3AC172E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0x6169F8A1

0x3796A4AC
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x75A5A87B

0x3796A4AC
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x2000F7A5
once more.
0x2A17E198

0x3796A4AC
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x5BB21DC2
know who will be her first visitor."
0x32E52815

0x3796A4AC
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x7DA24A9D
said Colonel Dent.
0xC9BE3B20

0x3796A4AC
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x233CBBE3

0x3796A4AC
Sam went and returned.
0xEBE1F90D

0x3796A4AC
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x32581AB0
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0xAE367EB6
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x6CEEED35

0x3796A4AC
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0x51E6A8E3

0x3796A4AC
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0x28326525
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x27832241
of his men.
0x6BC6A9DA

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xD733060E
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x411F1D2D
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0xDBA05493

0x3796A4AC
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xE7497C4A
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x2E3E3C8C
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0xA42E5D71
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x13F7B1D4

0x3796A4AC
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x2E8012B8
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0xE6E37189

0x3796A4AC
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x3E7381F5
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0x2A5A63A3
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0xDF3DC89A
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x96488FD3

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0xB5D39AAB

0x3796A4AC
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x9C2680CB

0x3796A4AC
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0x064387DF
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0x8ED1AC6E

0x3796A4AC
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0x2B99AD21
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x26DB66CF
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xA0A4B61C
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0xF422A29E
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0xE0FFD5A1
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x72BEB56D
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x1EDDAE59
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xDDD01161
morning, as he threatened."
0xD7059D3E

0x3796A4AC
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x47491874
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x5BE10059
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x2D84E0B7
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0xE4E340AE
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x514249A2
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x8B16153A
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0xFC612046
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xA67129E3

0x3796A4AC
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x28DEA405

0x3796A4AC
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0x29A4D3EE
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0x61471F05
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x933F8ACA
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0xA6D76ABD
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0xDFB485C7
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x5AAF05E4

0x3796A4AC
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xC7BF3BE7
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0x99CAE264
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0x59561DEC
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x7C87E5D7

0x3796A4AC
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xBBE2E2C0
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x15993327
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x373E5DF8

0x3796A4AC
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0x90D7073D
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0xF03C51F0
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x0EE9908F
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x2C245356
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0xDB732345
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0xFC474F03
they most wished for.
0x34362107

0x3796A4AC
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x4EA556F2
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x50B00F07
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x5399D370
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xA091AAE4
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x4EDE9EC3
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xA2AD3490
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0xCFBE2C6C

0x3796A4AC
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x96188A41
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x52257F41
saw Sam.
0xF9DCBAA8

0x3796A4AC
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x8E55B8A9
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xA27109EC
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0xBFB3ADEA
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0x362F39BB

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0xC963D907
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0xC800F228
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x9A343CB0
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xFFBFF476
quietly behind me.
0x1A66769C

0x3796A4AC
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0x19896452
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x6BF92D75

0x3796A4AC
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x929AEFA6
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x493E70EA

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XIX
0x91FA6137

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x066C165E
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0x02B5A3D5
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0xCD8D6E7C
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0xEA1E520F
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0x945BB808
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0xC2AE9F2E
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0x5E1FB783
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0xFA759F14
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x7BB15593

0x3796A4AC
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x743D2DBF
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0xDB319D60
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x8F440792
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0xE37F0BE3
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0xBB5097DE
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x2E2F35A0
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x51FB9ADC
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0xB78714BD
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xF00800AD

0x3796A4AC
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x1F7D0B81
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0xFA406286

0x3796A4AC
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0x984941A5
warn you, I have no faith."
0xC8A7B67F

0x3796A4AC
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0xFF992918
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0xAEFF0447

0x3796A4AC
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0xDF17F37C

0x3796A4AC
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x6BB5D43A

0x3796A4AC
"You need them all in your trade."
0x3DB0AC68

0x3796A4AC
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0xB8F4E79D
you tremble?"
0xED5AF31E

0x3796A4AC
"I'm not cold."
0xB59D7189

0x3796A4AC
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0xDB8E8462

0x3796A4AC
"I am not sick."
0xCF0A3F2B

0x3796A4AC
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0xF865BE51

0x3796A4AC
"I'm not silly."
0xB2AEA659

0x3796A4AC
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0xD6D78472
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0xD1AF0787
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x3469A26D
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0xC7871C4B
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x2A9B2179

0x3796A4AC
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0x1A47D229

0x3796A4AC
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x075A6AA6
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x1F9CA4F4
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x1645FB0C
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x43B188A0
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x5DF2C279
you."
0x50AAC609

0x3796A4AC
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x0DC3C6E0
with vigour.
0xF2F7C3AB

0x3796A4AC
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0x331864E2
solitary dependent in a great house."
0xEF6170EA

0x3796A4AC
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0xEA812205
one?"
0x5A26B08A

0x3796A4AC
"In my circumstances."
0x8BE964A5

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x519D7753
placed as you are."
0x73155974

0x3796A4AC
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0xE3CD67C7

0x3796A4AC
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0xABEA7DE5
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x3C577CA5
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0xB26FA3E7
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0xC327A53D

0x3796A4AC
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0xC5C805BC

0x3796A4AC
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0xEEC8632F

0x3796A4AC
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x7CC12AC9

0x3796A4AC
"To be sure."
0x75D7D6CB

0x3796A4AC
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x142B3105
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xD81A3C57
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0x53D4A20B
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0x6D2BB060

0x3796A4AC
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xED007248
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x755E2AD5
there."
0x5ACDD2F2

0x3796A4AC
"I believe you," said I.
0x1B230DDD

0x3796A4AC
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0xA8877A6F
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0x917DC6C1

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x8AFE601A
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xDCEFAD4A

0x3796A4AC
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0xE62731F4
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0x04A11747
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x8168BF50

0x3796A4AC
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x10120949
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x67F78F06
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0xBFA9384B
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x1FF3E5C8
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0xBDDF25D4
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0xFE73A82D

0x3796A4AC
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0x0B1F4C27

0x3796A4AC
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xEDCB5C19
whispers of the future?"
0x8E046223

0x3796A4AC
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x3B41A4D0
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0x4898D177

0x3796A4AC
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0xFFFA1D5B
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0xC0E33EED

0x3796A4AC
"You have learned them from the servants."
0x5BF96ED0

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0xDCB892DC
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x840C257B

0x3796A4AC
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0xE8C16570

0x3796A4AC
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0x952DCA27
after all, then!"
0x38A67771

0x3796A4AC
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0x4684279D
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0xE732F342
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x6DB0D41D
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0x1C577FDC
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0xC14DBD7B
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0xFEBEA490

0x3796A4AC
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x1A556746

0x3796A4AC
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0x04566610

0x3796A4AC
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0xA95E1E3B
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0xFC342D41

0x3796A4AC
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0xB4B26AEF

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0xABCCBD6C
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0x9667D375

0x3796A4AC
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0x4CA4CEF6

0x3796A4AC
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0x9F8529AE

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x82D043A4
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x76A790D3
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0xE63BB48B

0x3796A4AC
"I what?"
0xB0B4DBFF

0x3796A4AC
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0x2A59FD5E

0x3796A4AC
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x575D5112
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x1C198E5C
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0x54E07FC1
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x7F753572
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0xDC328A81
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0xC1F70648

0x3796A4AC
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0x278DF8BC
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x8E93E960

0x3796A4AC
"He is not at home."
0xA72ED7BA

0x3796A4AC
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0x8A1F3740
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x484E0B5B
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x40961596
it were, out of existence?"
0x9B7D7AFC

0x3796A4AC
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0x75EF7F8E
you had introduced."
0xC5DE9816

0x3796A4AC
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0x96649049
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0xBC065EF2
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0x7C52CE8F

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0xB91E59F3

0x3796A4AC
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0x193132B6
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0xCF3521C4
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0x0751A273

0x3796A4AC
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0xE39E46D2
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0xB51980DA
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0xF67B527C
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0xAD87B3DF
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0xFCACF456
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0x74D64FAC

0x3796A4AC
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0xF82B6CF7
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0x8ED3F4F0
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0x47B2853E
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0x395520B9
noticed this?"
0x1C539C1D

0x3796A4AC
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x75907B93

0x3796A4AC
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0xC78D2F01
gratitude?"
0x80B62459

0x3796A4AC
I said nothing.
0x1D7E4889

0x3796A4AC
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x6CB67E45
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0x760C2C01

0x3796A4AC
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0x1979C49F

0x3796A4AC
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0x65961CE8

0x3796A4AC
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0x22703710
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0x3B5D6929

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x13C8982A

0x3796A4AC
"Shortly?"
0xA92EFB1F

0x3796A4AC
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0x80E70B9B
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0x5B32A7DD
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0xE8F3AF44
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x2572D5D9
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0x1566C182
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0xAF32891E
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0xC19E0039
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0x67BA5DE5
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0x6B4966B2
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0xECA7A09D

0x3796A4AC
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0xAD1976B2
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0x63CFA63A

0x3796A4AC
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0xF9DB4924
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0x121D81DE
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0x322F2132
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x69A056DE
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0x3027FB7E
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0xACDB6C00

0x3796A4AC
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0x3813F1E8

0x3796A4AC
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0x22E200DE
p190.jpg}
0xFA59E2FF

0x3796A4AC
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x57A3348A
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0x2459BB39

0x3796A4AC
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0x5B37AEAC
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0xBE544068
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0x93509AF1
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0x549F40A3
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x2055F3CC
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0x5ED975D6
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0x2B348C52
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0xD5067451
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xAEC6DAE8

0x3796A4AC
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0xF7D7EDBD
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0xF82296F3
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0xB0B7EE8D
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0x93706F00
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0x28045EA8
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0x8CA8591A

0x3796A4AC
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0x527BB01A
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0x5B4A635C
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0x40B5FBD9
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0xEFC96DEF
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0x44013C47
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0x0F1AE5E3
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0x23E75010
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0x0F240F45
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x2D7EB39E
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0xC35AC3D2
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0x155EE420
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x610BE6BB
dictates of conscience.'
0x5939CC8A

0x3796A4AC
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0xD1B68E91
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0x6E7C3B93
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0x7105E35C
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0x63D8743D
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0xBF338D56
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0xB10D68CA
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0x97D29A68
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x68782AB9
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0xBC88177E
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0xA5600F89
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0x198833CD
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0x22004522
me; the play is played out'."
0x0B3C9EC6

0x3796A4AC
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x57F9D1A9
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0x7F83C29A
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0xF4E55DBE
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x91BE2CE8
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0xE5CC7E62
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0x0F8DE7B2
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x36C664D7
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x75D5CE39
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0x5D04B943
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0xD0076831
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0xD68D9EEF
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x3963EAB4
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0x39E7E3BB

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x84EE996A

0x3796A4AC
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0xA93DC70C

0x3796A4AC
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x31EBD626

0x3796A4AC
"Break it, sir."
0xF628FC7A

0x3796A4AC
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0xDAD5FF82
disguise.
0x50EFFE16

0x3796A4AC
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0x9D6DA283

0x3796A4AC
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0x1C2CC0B5

0x3796A4AC
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x4C353421

0x3796A4AC
"But not with you?"
0xF48DC0D0

0x3796A4AC
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0x8FAADC47

0x3796A4AC
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0xC91F5FAF

0x3796A4AC
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x371A1381
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0x7B2D3238
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x2F1FA035

0x3796A4AC
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0x9EADE640

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0xA121A41E
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x268B6501
but it was not right."
0x488175F9

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0xD5999535

0x3796A4AC
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0x24A7A751
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0xD3890A44
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0x710C5D51
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0xBC0579D7
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x93F28797
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0x3400AC38
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0x9C7BAAEF
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0xBE912B99

0x3796A4AC
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x0E7C39D2
signify?"
0xFB6E4A63

0x3796A4AC
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0x0EFB70A0
now, I suppose?"
0xF39FED58

0x3796A4AC
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0xC94ABA22
yonder are doing."
0x4BBF77A1

0x3796A4AC
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0x1F07F70B

0x3796A4AC
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0x2D276EB8

0x3796A4AC
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x1D17D357
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0xCF9759A9
left this morning?"
0xCF994AAA

0x3796A4AC
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0x2A2027EF

0x3796A4AC
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x9F1B4F98
installing himself here till you returned."
0x507B60DE

0x3796A4AC
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x9B8D6DC3

0x3796A4AC
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0xE5E5F7C0
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x7D83C00E

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0xFE815B77
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x7DDCB8E0
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x0DAB2233

0x3796A4AC
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x7043F8CF
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x0F2C0FD1
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0xE51218DD
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x824BE4D4
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x1D04B319

0x3796A4AC
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0x9095D24D

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x95A72AB1

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0xC996726F

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0xED2156F3

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0xAE4F6365

0x3796A4AC
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x6AC67651
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0xDCCB3292
and dreary look.
0x62DA77CB

0x3796A4AC
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0xCF8DF6EF
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x1011AEB2

0x3796A4AC
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x189D0DB8

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x35694DE3

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x7874A63F

0x3796A4AC
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x42F8DEE7
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x16BE63B5
doing."
0x18AD88AA

0x3796A4AC
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0xE6C27C83
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x2FA631D3
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0xD141CD14
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x7365861F
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0x33F584B7
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0xD0B107AB
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xBC381E47
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0x02BD982B
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x73E870A6

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0xB01A6BDC
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0xC28CB09A

0x3796A4AC
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x6DF9F9AA
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x84CCECCC

0x3796A4AC
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0xB7A0F704

0x3796A4AC
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x2B48D59D
strange?"
0x095E5529

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x16ECB034

0x3796A4AC
"And Mason?"
0xB6BA43E2

0x3796A4AC
"He was laughing too."
0xD51AEABF

0x3796A4AC
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xFA3595E6
Jane?"
0x2C36C3D6

0x3796A4AC
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x7A6FFF6D

0x3796A4AC
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0xE4B0D7D3
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0xC862D085
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0xDD1428A9

0x3796A4AC
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0xE92059BB
you."
0x50AAC609

0x3796A4AC
"To comfort me?"
0x12712DCC

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x2A487EE8

0x3796A4AC
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0xA68CE090

0x3796A4AC
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x155CAF88
care nothing about it."
0xFC95660C

0x3796A4AC
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x027DB690

0x3796A4AC
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0xA132D639
you, I am sure, do."
0x5A097083

0x3796A4AC
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0xFD10D69C
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x219ED33A
and then leave me."
0xF4C85900

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0x1D251E2F
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x136C5806
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x6DF15D8E

0x3796A4AC
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x614736D8
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x1E462744
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x51935ED1

0x3796A4AC
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0x2A0A7603
asleep.
0x9092AADD

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XX
0x38272707

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0xD4F7C12C
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x949885A6
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xFA1B56C8
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x026D166D
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x81658B7F
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0xE990B09E
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0xC163BFBD
the curtain.
0x2504289A

0x3796A4AC
Good God!  What a cry!
0xB04A2A77

0x3796A4AC
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x58381B20
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x59C01579

0x3796A4AC
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0x3FAF4B97
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x8AF670A3
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0xA482AD44
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xD6B47B19
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x20F9241C
it could repeat the effort.
0x5572B1CA

0x3796A4AC
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xD573D467
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0xD60F085E
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0xAFFD714E
voice shouted--
0x546F287C

0x3796A4AC
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x7FD03475

0x3796A4AC
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x8BA99E87
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0xD6894CA2

0x3796A4AC
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0x80BEA437

0x3796A4AC
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xF07EE99E
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0x2898B8E2
was silence.
0xBED2B7A6

0x3796A4AC
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0xC746E3F6
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0xB7AB57C5
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0xC3CCE815
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x2E96F087
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x77ED2E0C
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x28A128F8
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x777BEC36
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x9ED0D9F3
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x7466D42C
confusion was inextricable.
0x0A1B3BAD

0x3796A4AC
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0xF9230E38
in his bed."
0x77A7F89B

0x3796A4AC
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0x6E92BFDD
coming."
0x6105F3F1

0x3796A4AC
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x9D0C0478
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0xA6C61508
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x4DE3DD38

0x3796A4AC
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x1FAB2B82
worst at once!"
0xDAAE6BC8

0x3796A4AC
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x26EDA4C8
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0x6273CBFA
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0x640AE175

0x3796A4AC
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x522B2FC9
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0xB26BC070

0x3796A4AC
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xE67DE6E7
by an effort, he added--
0x206AF219

0x3796A4AC
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x104DF5F3
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0xFE11FF80
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x24F2B245
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x24E09C0E
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0x42EC0003
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0xE99997C7
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x33870504
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x106F4D4F
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x780C5DE4

0x3796A4AC
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x2CD50D4A
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0xBCD9CCF7
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0xEC7D67A2
had left it.
0x0D0E6BA4

0x3796A4AC
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0xC58FE8FA
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0xAFDBA922
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x290EAB92
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x0FD6B5F9
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xED2B327F
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0x9B2A9ADC
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0xF0C79CAD
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0xA29C30B6
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x46007199
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x68604103

0x3796A4AC
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x4A394F9C
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0xC4BFC6F8
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x63956E28
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0xC883C4C1
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0xFB7870B7
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x2BF947CA
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0xD800477D

0x3796A4AC
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x4A641067

0x3796A4AC
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0xF2CB13E1

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And dressed?"
0x214A7C73

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Come out, then, quietly."
0xF37689E0

0x3796A4AC
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0xAE73DEB0

0x3796A4AC
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x9C520178
noise."
0xD70211B5

0x3796A4AC
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x9F4B8B0D
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x5D93D031
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x111B8005
side.
0x78543FC3

0x3796A4AC
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0x36BAE998

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x1838A52C

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Go back and fetch both."
0x5E7D2299

0x3796A4AC
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0x35AFD471
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x3231F799
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0xC71C49B8
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xC87E7345

0x3796A4AC
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0xBC7447D4

0x3796A4AC
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0xC217E847

0x3796A4AC
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x5D9AAB51

0x3796A4AC
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x0ECB4C62
fit."
0x0FC187ED

0x3796A4AC
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x3C4EB52C
the key and opened the door.
0xBED9B21F

0x3796A4AC
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x91AAC476
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x000143F9
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x94F1E291
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x7974A26B
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x8C99A2D8
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x02ADB884
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0xA15DB0F3
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0xE163B004
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0xFF6E2BD5
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x3B29122D
came out and closed the door behind him.
0x1E3D7016

0x3796A4AC
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0xC3BF67A7
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x29DF5165
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x27EE28F9
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x37410C4A
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x663BB12F
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0xBD366A62
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0xC29187E1
blood.
0xC7CA05C2

0x3796A4AC
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x07BA686F
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x4C3C2457
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0x7F7BA9F0
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0xBA3201D9
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0xF23BD350
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xD027D9DB
blood, trickling fast down.
0xE791F6A3

0x3796A4AC
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x65FCE8A8

0x3796A4AC
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xBEC05AF7
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0x359CEED6
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0x3771CEA8

0x3796A4AC
"Sir?"
0x4A6427AA

0x3796A4AC
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0xDC9CFA4F
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0xAC02D4C0
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x57578AF3
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0x1D385A98
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x03498FDD
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x2256BD1C
consequences."
0xE07315D4

0x3796A4AC
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0xD0816175
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xC3218EF4
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x15E22EF5
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0xA23B4370
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0xA8BBD86A
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x0BE58FFF
step ceased to be heard.
0x783762F6

0x3796A4AC
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xB2F08796
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x1B1D43F8
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0xA68D6453
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x7ED20729
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0xA20188EA

0x3796A4AC
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x28FE7EA8
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x53D9440F
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xD63ED319
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0xCBDE2AAB
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0xC7863709
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0x092E8805
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0xCFC50C50
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0x3AEFE96B
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0xDA3A7ADA
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0xDE45D8E2
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x72C837E7
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x8F059651

0x3796A4AC
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x803AB5E2
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0xBB8512FE
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0xC864A96B
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0xBE7D961E
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0x31242BC0
subordinate's form.
0x6F705E42

0x3796A4AC
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x0578837C
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0xA0891034
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x52830CE2
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0xAFDC57EA
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x6E495371

0x3796A4AC
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0xA4905AEE
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x1799A4C5
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0xFD994024
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x724E3A27
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0xC113A251
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0x6A57E20E

0x3796A4AC
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0x3D9015E1
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x7B30F6A6
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x10E31D13
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x9F2496D0
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x4DA27F84
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xB8683E47
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0x4712C43C
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x67B1DF00
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x830A3636
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xE17A8A24
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0xE76053D8
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x5259BB03
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0x0F1565C3
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0xA914F3E5
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0x3D269642
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0xB6BE0170
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0xB9F895D4
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0xAF6C82C6
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0x9375C4B6

0x3796A4AC
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x48BBE36E
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x8EA6FD3F
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0xD3B7E9D9
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0x236675C2
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x5DE1C2BE

0x3796A4AC
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0x56BB4CE7
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x4BA96E03
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x29807C32
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0xA983968F
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0x07BDDBCD
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x9A5A6625
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0x259B98B6
I might not even speak to him.
0x269CD7D5

0x3796A4AC
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x5B22FD86
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0x423BDEC3
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x2DB8B80D
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x0966D7A9
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xFECA84CF
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x590AF051
shorter.
0xF3E44311

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0x9ECB0B0A

0x3796A4AC
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0xCF3BDFB6
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0xDF6C5023
patient downstairs and all."
0x724BF4DF

0x3796A4AC
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x23B584B1

0x3796A4AC
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x18DDE084
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x222A1D13

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x5D9DF176
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x85FBAECD
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0xE6C928DA
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x8E25C864

0x3796A4AC
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0xEC22C290

0x3796A4AC
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xFB60293B

0x3796A4AC
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x9CD9E28D
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0xA28024DA
there's no danger."
0xC7C9EBD6

0x3796A4AC
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x54FED075
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xB9BB9C3A
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0xE6A4A81F
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0xDEC76808
here!"
0x403B277A

0x3796A4AC
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x5B6084B4
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x332AFF1F

0x3796A4AC
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x3FE2B6E6
said Mr. Rochester.
0xA252D4EC

0x3796A4AC
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x76A10407
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0x8A2F1E55
looked so quiet at first."
0x7329896B

0x3796A4AC
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x03DCC557
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x1E982B36
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x71F905F4
alone."
0xD3D62EC4

0x3796A4AC
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xB77D0100

0x3796A4AC
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x7E1BCAD0
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0xE0D757D0
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0xAC482FF2
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xF3A2DD1B

0x3796A4AC
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x7421ED9A
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x152682C1

0x3796A4AC
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0xC5B7F752

0x3796A4AC
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x768F80A1
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x80459979
said--
0x873BFE59

0x3796A4AC
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0xD6A99C88
it."
0x261BF314

0x3796A4AC
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0xFBD851DA

0x3796A4AC
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0xD61E6585
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0x4EA7C85C
think of her at all."
0x768DB0DE

0x3796A4AC
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0x57DF55DD

0x3796A4AC
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xA69463FC
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0x1418039C
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x260808BF
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xFC6354E4
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x3854901E
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x48EF162B
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x2EF0AD6B

0x3796A4AC
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x57D77763
and returned with them.
0xB8F367C5

0x3796A4AC
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0xA04C2CD7
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0x1AB38950

0x3796A4AC
I retired as directed.
0x0E66CAB0

0x3796A4AC
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x60EA8EF9
Rochester presently.
0x9073C842

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x30C7856F

0x3796A4AC
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x5B506C64
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0xC009EFB2
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0xB5586C9A
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0x457240B1
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0xBEECB868
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xFA10AB7B
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0xC6854CB2

0x3796A4AC
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x383D980D
edged with fur.
0x1B1EEB06

0x3796A4AC
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xD8BB736B
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x99E895A2
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0x0362BBC2
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x11F1C174
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xF9588641

0x3796A4AC
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0xF6BB214B

0x3796A4AC
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x3C006D25
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0xC845AA82
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x089D96B8
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0x3EA542C3
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0x04712E7C

0x3796A4AC
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0xF4251A2C
the washstand.
0x1180CB27

0x3796A4AC
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0x41CDFA7D

0x3796A4AC
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x003E9F3D
to Mason.
0x34671D25

0x3796A4AC
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0xB2C630D1

0x3796A4AC
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0xDF1ADB48

0x3796A4AC
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x3344B174

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xA1E87B46
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0xD47FEDAC
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xDBB2CBBE
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x6339ABBB

0x3796A4AC
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0xCD8C82CC

0x3796A4AC
The patient rose.
0xC3373BE2

0x3796A4AC
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x8F8640CA
step out--that's it!"
0xF35B8B32

0x3796A4AC
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x0750E32F

0x3796A4AC
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xE641623A
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x730AE40D
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x7199054A
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0xFE6EAEBF
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x87A0A677

0x3796A4AC
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x3ACE2162
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x7EC274F6
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0xF6583F1F
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0xB04E6A18
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x47698AB1
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0x793DFBF1
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0xD8EC7710
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x77C7BB7F
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0xA38E9722
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0xE933A617
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x906D095C
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x2F5348F5

0x3796A4AC
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x3C73A0FD
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xE70C39AE
chaise; Carter followed.
0xB1232046

0x3796A4AC
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0x1E254B2F
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x7B2C4A08
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x0A1AB99F

0x3796A4AC
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0x8126181D

0x3796A4AC
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x7FC28491
Dick."
0x1CB26698

0x3796A4AC
"Fairfax--"
0x1DE642FE

0x3796A4AC
"Well what is it?"
0xF4452212

0x3796A4AC
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x84B93AE5
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0x97DD481E

0x3796A4AC
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x916F8677
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0xC060B72E

0x3796A4AC
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x1DACBF82
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0x05A247B5

0x3796A4AC
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xA7243633
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0xF61E37A0
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0xB4022C4E
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x33ACCB23

0x3796A4AC
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0xF800D863
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x9D231650

0x3796A4AC
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x43163934

0x3796A4AC
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0xDA2ECB1C
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0xFA522D59
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0xF544310E
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xCA2427B2
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0xCF903223
pure."
0xA9A6B15F

0x3796A4AC
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x336327EA
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x297817A5
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x0A49EE7E
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x3DD1348E
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0xE12413EC
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x6675ACB5
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x3397E2CE
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x611E057B

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x30F162A8

0x3796A4AC
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0x4103A5DC
me.
0xD35B5291

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you, sir."
0xD4D52FBA

0x3796A4AC
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x87340D80
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x9960D295
atmosphere?"
0x9C825852

0x3796A4AC
"I do, very much."
0xBD491678

0x3796A4AC
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0xCFC9BF66

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x0500D0BB
with Mason?"
0x7BD4BD01

0x3796A4AC
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0xB3ADCFD4

0x3796A4AC
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x2F700138
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x216827C5
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0xD5843B46

0x3796A4AC
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x09271BAD

0x3796A4AC
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0x5B90191B
thoughts."
0x98B30581

0x3796A4AC
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0xC94E25EC

0x3796A4AC
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0x4273ED76

0x3796A4AC
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0x594A0479

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0x3B1F32C0
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0xAD98B8BF
spue fire any day."
0x44DE3D70

0x3796A4AC
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0xCF48F84F
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0x8383A2E5
you."
0x50AAC609

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0x74DA7C60
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x3A799574
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0xF4FF2355

0x3796A4AC
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x8997B1D5
how to avert the danger."
0x3B18282F

0x3796A4AC
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x4393B851
from him.
0xB21EB050

0x3796A4AC
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0xD66DD28A
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0xE684E371
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xBCDBC4EF
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0xC6D8EA52
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x1436BF7E
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0xA02054C8
friend, are you not?"
0x6F36EF31

0x3796A4AC
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x0BAC3396

0x3796A4AC
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0xF9C59E37
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0xD25769EF
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0xEC7979EE
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0x52AF7FAF
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0xBA5C8532
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x75F8902E
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0x4A8572C0
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x4792F614
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x2BA9810E
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x7C91DDD0
me at once."
0x615F91D9

0x3796A4AC
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0xA8FC4B20
you are very safe."
0xF5541DE1

0x3796A4AC
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x0AB0B584

0x3796A4AC
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0xF50206C3
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0xE2E33D00
before him.
0x4053610E

0x3796A4AC
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x7C22EA28
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x28D5CB38

0x3796A4AC
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0xF3B9D547

0x3796A4AC
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x6D696B55
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xEF7C4EF6
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x8878BDBB
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x3754A03E
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0xDF933813
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0xB01BA871

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir; I am content."
0x9D07FE3D

0x3796A4AC
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xC2DC9E61
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x94444259
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x2AC3300C
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x13422DD8
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x6B03EF5F
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x5D5C068F
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xF251DBD2
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0x57EEED2F
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0x17129B9A
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x2E2557CF
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x795591D7
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0xF8336C1F
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0xF7C25AD8
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x8A655495
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0xE90CEF7B
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0xED828ACB
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x91E536FA
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x0D03285E
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0xA3107434
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0x9E86A0A4
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x3E043FB6
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0x8E65B123
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0xF6EAC3C9
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0xD987915B
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0xBE9FB0E4
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x1818DC6F
judgment approves?"
0xEEB9D4F5

0x3796A4AC
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0xFDCD42E0
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xE0A1495D
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x9C274A47
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0xEFB0C5B8
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x5FE083C8

0x3796A4AC
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0x31E4AE03

0x3796A4AC
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x427A1C81
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0xBC94A318
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0xD967D8D7
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xD075A63E

0x3796A4AC
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0xE0256A18
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0xBC019104
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x3CB2FE25
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0xD68DA195
amend and solace to heal."
0x5479F856

0x3796A4AC
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x96E87089
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x34227835
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0xAFFDAEF7
instrument for my cure in--"
0xEC199225

0x3796A4AC
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xF23BF2F7
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x1B231ABB
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0xC387B107
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0xB0B6C993
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x4D75E305

0x3796A4AC
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x0C27B171
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0xE21E4CFF
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x5AC1601B
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xA9ACA692

0x3796A4AC
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x935755BA
came back he was humming a tune.
0x59B79804

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x6FFDE0E3
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x49D325EE

0x3796A4AC
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x61028922

0x3796A4AC
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0xBF0A8458
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xDA923634
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x92D496A6

0x3796A4AC
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0xC32DFB17

0x3796A4AC
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0x1D5836EC
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x2FCEF7B4
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0x946AA3C3

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0xD2E542C4

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x0846B495
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x07AAB995
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0xD1A860E5

0x3796A4AC
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0x4CB906B1
cheerfully--
0xE9DFBBBB

0x3796A4AC
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0xD2A2E78C
I rose at four to see him off."
0x16489EF1

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXI
0x5197369F

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x38EB0303
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0xA864EF8F
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x005ECCB0
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x188440DC
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x3B2780AA
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x356584B2
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0xB3DB773A
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0x3681FA3D
man.
0x34B1B0FB

0x3796A4AC
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0x37A97E4E
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x2BFF6C8F
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0xCAB9DF01
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0xB1906B29
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0x05FEFAED
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x2D11FC04
little sister.
0x4B395272

0x3796A4AC
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0x347942B5
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0x574F9A97
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x2CD57808
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xF14F7531
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x79ABC619
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x6BECC7D0
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x9D7F010E
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0xB6E68BE1
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x1112B418

0x3796A4AC
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0xDF02DE6D
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x1F86EE8C
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x5ABA69BA
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x9C9DC82F
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0xC5F73CDA
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xB9A393AE
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0x9F366511
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x5B91E30E
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x7D4BA1B9

0x3796A4AC
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0x8F82E503
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0xD9602C2A
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0xE0D9627E

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0xC9180CA3
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0xE624414A
are married to Bessie?"
0x446AA833

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xC5907E14
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0xBD56E91C
child are thriving."
0x86CF4C70

0x3796A4AC
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0xEA079D61

0x3796A4AC
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0xC19438E6
badly at present--in great trouble."
0xD26ECCFE

0x3796A4AC
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x595262EC
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x5FC9E8BA

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0x4EECEA50

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. John?"
0xF4B512B0

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x625D4210

0x3796A4AC
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0xE4061B8D
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x54C5F116
his death was shocking."
0x376BBF82

0x3796A4AC
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x9223909A

0x3796A4AC
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x01D66D9F
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x8510369B
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x808A3126
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0xAEBBD00D
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0xEB26FD9B
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0xE39D0E56
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x3186ADEA
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x79554CA8
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x3032F424

0x3796A4AC
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x8D604FEE

0x3796A4AC
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x4E9DAB6C
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x1F5B1B88
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0xA0C41BF2
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x6111E165
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0xA8E1B5AF
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0xD8CEAB60
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x8F56D6D5
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0xFF7683B2
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0xA00134C5
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0xEB672C1D
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0xAB799D10
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0xD2BD34B0
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x6DAEF950
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0x4194934F
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x4BDBE480
morning."
0xB669FF1D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xAFB60B94

0x3796A4AC
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x253D6054
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x78EDB940

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x8E3B84A2
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x755BE190
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xA2F3B2B1

0x3796A4AC
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x7A2B5C2F
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x8F5B657E
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0xDBBB747C
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0xFA5449DD
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x3580FA19
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x992149BB
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xA35EDC21
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0x0D0283B3
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x69DBA25E
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x8C1FB256
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0xCB8EFFE1
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xF4F15D71
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0x1480759A
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xE1805DE6
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0x4B086A2B
lineaments.
0x38AC9121

0x3796A4AC
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x85B47147
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0xDC1D2716
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xA60DE90B
cue and followed me from the room.
0x59F74CAD

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xE8251D9D
which he had shut.
0xB5E31097

0x3796A4AC
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0x434B6762

0x3796A4AC
"What to do?--where to go?"
0xD80AC062

0x3796A4AC
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0x34502D13

0x3796A4AC
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0xC6D39DFC

0x3796A4AC
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x94C6F3D6

0x3796A4AC
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0xBDC3B01E
people to see her that distance?"
0x3BF62D95

0x3796A4AC
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0xFECF7BC1

0x3796A4AC
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0x6E9883B5

0x3796A4AC
"It is his widow, sir."
0x517D3B35

0x3796A4AC
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x2AD743AD

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0xF280CB1F

0x3796A4AC
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x99C29608
had no relations."
0x73D83EE4

0x3796A4AC
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x47E821B0
off."
0x53C63931

0x3796A4AC
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0x3796A4AC
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x4DDD3838

0x3796A4AC
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0x81669267
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0xB0BBDE5C
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0x06F8808C
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0xFF8FA2D7
in London."
0x148EF8D1

0x3796A4AC
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x09CF54EA
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0x98D5B262
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0x396EC5BA

0x3796A4AC
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0xBFFC1E48
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0xBEE78AEA
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x3409C419

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0x71B58F06
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0x677723EA

0x3796A4AC
"How long will you stay?"
0x4BD5D5CE

0x3796A4AC
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0xCC789A35

0x3796A4AC
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0x37E63AF6

0x3796A4AC
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0xF06FAEA7

0x3796A4AC
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0xD109BA2F
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0x1323B8C1

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0x0D4620FE

0x3796A4AC
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x0D78261F

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x4B003760

0x3796A4AC
"A person to be trusted?"
0xF09B1F54

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0xF037CAB2

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0xF5D4936D

0x3796A4AC
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0xBC795308

0x3796A4AC
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0x9539410F
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0x85613F20
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0xBD529A62

0x3796A4AC
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x204D3D7B
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x07FB4E73
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0xA5964CF0
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0x89F74DB0
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0x83196A0C

0x3796A4AC
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0x8D25D21F

0x3796A4AC
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x07FE993F
if recollecting something, he said--
0xEE948926

0x3796A4AC
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0xF0A12879
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0x4DFA70C7
plenty?"
0x67A3791A

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0x03606E71

0x3796A4AC
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0x342936DC

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0xCFCBAD1F
while I have the opportunity."
0xB01FBF05

0x3796A4AC
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0xB9CE7960

0x3796A4AC
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0x4C24B994
married?"
0x43BB6D16

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; what then?"
0x0A85D623

0x3796A4AC
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0x245C9F16
perceive the necessity of it."
0x2013ED06

0x3796A4AC
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x979A58DD
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0x69B83508
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0xB49BACC6
straight to--the devil?"
0x48314ABE

0x3796A4AC
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0xA1992A47

0x3796A4AC
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0xA794C730
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0xCF51AB44

0x3796A4AC
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0x5BA4E66F
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0x57C61EFA

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0xD5D529C9
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0xAB17C76D

0x3796A4AC
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0x7286C850
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0x15C51BF1
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x4FE2B967

0x3796A4AC
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0x2346B74D
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0xEE7CC5AE

0x3796A4AC
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0xD5925C47
five pounds, Jane."
0x44A93D43

0x3796A4AC
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0x9C11F63F

0x3796A4AC
"Just let me look at the cash."
0xA3FD185C

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0x7042F152

0x3796A4AC
"Jane!"
0xA5F18795

0x3796A4AC
"Sir?"
0x4A6427AA

0x3796A4AC
"Promise me one thing."
0xBA2F0FCE

0x3796A4AC
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0x31E662B2

0x3796A4AC
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0x3507EB03
find you one in time."
0x8187FE4B

0x3796A4AC
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0x83E27CCE
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0xCFD94728
it."
0x261BF314

0x3796A4AC
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0xA7EB6948
then?"
0x4C85FCBB

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir; early."
0x5BA006AD

0x3796A4AC
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0x2E2DC921

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0xDF40C624

0x3796A4AC
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0x4B91DA30

0x3796A4AC
"I suppose so, sir."
0x40CA41AF

0x3796A4AC
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0x0E5877D0
not quite up to it."
0xF468D725

0x3796A4AC
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0xE4DBD00B

0x3796A4AC
"Then say it."
0xF75CD29C

0x3796A4AC
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0xE5EC05FE

0x3796A4AC
"What must I say?"
0x91A70C3E

0x3796A4AC
"The same, if you like, sir."
0x74C825C3

0x3796A4AC
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0xF4E6CBF9

0x3796A4AC
"Yes?"
0xB458066A

0x3796A4AC
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0xC728C081
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x45B7FAF5
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0x0713AD1A
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0x1AAC8F2B

0x3796A4AC
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0x9D05A915
as in many."
0x7817BFAF

0x3796A4AC
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0xA7170E5A

0x3796A4AC
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x02AC0482
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0x330C2A90
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0xECF2A23A
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x5B9154C5

0x3796A4AC
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0xF9F91190
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x23AB2512
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0xBEB45924
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xBDC806D5
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xE7E07C76
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x80769B71

0x3796A4AC
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0xFF5DCA11

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0x81AAC3C7
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x1878189E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0x09E9D0DA
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x5A2FFFB7
will finally recover."
0x597C1C91

0x3796A4AC
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0x8BA34F45

0x3796A4AC
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x9C7CD2BC
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x34B5E7F6
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0xBE9C5416
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0x83A4D6B3
and then I will go up with you?"
0x0AA20744

0x3796A4AC
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x0FFED60B
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0x6FF9A43C
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0xFE9B553F
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0x5D45C709
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x80733716

0x3796A4AC
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0xE50677C8
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x4D40DEF4
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0xDEC9AA5B
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0xB56078AF
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0x9214A468
looks.
0xE51D1A0D

0x3796A4AC
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x4AFB2E77
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x20AF735E
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x351C5C9E
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xB3583DB9
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x66C760BA
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x06A1E7B6

0x3796A4AC
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0xE6ADB953
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x09635455
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0xC7A8F6B0
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0xF47EA27E
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x68383565
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x57A92F00
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x16E3CE74

0x3796A4AC
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0xC2C1EB46
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x323F90A2
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x6AB5D4F6
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x75622541
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x7C4816A7
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0xD44C6660
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x0D438131
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x6C26C9C6
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0x9158A055
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x2252769F
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xEB314284
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0x16FD1072

0x3796A4AC
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x55A1AC6B
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0xC347286D

0x3796A4AC
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x21780464
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0x90404D73
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x4759C2B1
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x5C2B834C
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x479473DA
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x449A21AA
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0xB5106C29
past recognition.
0x997BD89C

0x3796A4AC
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0x855E10AD
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0xC0FA9325
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xCC1B0903
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0xCB08550E
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0x538CC758
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xB94BFCED
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x777121EA
colourless visage.
0x2F13AA7E

0x3796A4AC
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x20D66BAC
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x87D02B0D
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0xDB8E98C5
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0xBA323E2D
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0xEBB971FB
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x3583B513
other's looked puritanical.
0x990C21B4

0x3796A4AC
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0x6BC26FAD
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xB14683C1
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0xBA5AFB00
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0xBD283655
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x176B45B0

0x3796A4AC
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x8C3646E6
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0xBD50E025
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x493F66DB
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xE11D22FA
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0xB9FBDE3C
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0xB7C0815D
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xBAEBD6F4
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x9859B680
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xD00B63C5
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x7AA0B5C7
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xF5341E35
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0x96678628
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0xDD637738

0x3796A4AC
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0xCB4737E3
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0xB0AA9CAE
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x75BFA1FE
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0xE01AC858
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0xDFCED310
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x1B8FDC80
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x12BC7C14
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x474D6297
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0xE1F7F4AF

0x3796A4AC
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0xD2D92420
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x59FD6B4E
liberty.
0x754355D5

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x6E589340
can see her to-night."
0x65CDFC7D

0x3796A4AC
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x0280422B
should be much obliged to you."
0x621DBC3F

0x3796A4AC
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x75AE794A
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x3924A69F
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x860DEDB1

0x3796A4AC
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xF574A6FF
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x72B007D2
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0xAE302192
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0xE3ACB754
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0x2391F6B9
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x10E7069A
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0xAC19A9B7
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x68F5829A
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0xA171EBFE
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x1A4F1BE9
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x8667FAC4
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x738D2226
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x08C67281
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x0021448A
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x5F8880A7

0x3796A4AC
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x365298B8
us see if she will know you."
0x7F8CE66D

0x3796A4AC
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0xDE494823
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0xD78C1FE7
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0xF66242D9
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x84C08D0B
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x6C1A760D
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x674053C1
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0xEF8B51EF
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x4F92FA4F
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x55B27EAF
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x98ACF9F7
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0x7CEA596B

0x3796A4AC
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0xA33F8B5D
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x21B803C6
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xFE64474B
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0xD7E27652
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x8023E38D
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0x11988B1F
amity.
0x90E39163

0x3796A4AC
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x8DCF3E13
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x2ADB583E
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0xBAA1ECB8
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0xDD23A4D2
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x1929FD5A
she looked at me.
0xE72C6A1C

0x3796A4AC
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0xD9EEC1FE

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0xB240EEB1

0x3796A4AC
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0xE72303DE
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0x24B4351F
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0xCE227757
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x4A9273EE
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x19BEDDB6
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x0C553FAD
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0xA4B65867
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x6EB2E761
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0xA38140F7
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0x35E0886B
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x0E83E727
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0xC1B2DAA6

0x3796A4AC
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xB88DA81B
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0xE9FE145A
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x2D06BD9C
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x5180CACB
the pillow.
0x426F6656

0x3796A4AC
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xA4535AFC
till I see how you get on."
0x5FBD8628

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0xE1EF3FB1

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0x38473D65
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x6E81BCE1
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x9B2A93F4
say--let me see--"
0xD920DC43

0x3796A4AC
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x292C7F4B
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x983A041E
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x71E18D82
was at once irritated.
0x363DBB86

0x3796A4AC
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x634927BD
you Jane Eyre?"
0x93501CDF

0x3796A4AC
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x089E3171

0x3796A4AC
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x4022221B
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x2ADEF02E
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x7ED9C857
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0x404CE397
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x4821BED8
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x4ACB4812
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0xFC0F4438
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0xE04816C2
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x51F9B9BE

0x3796A4AC
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x490B31C9

0x3796A4AC
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0xE33C9B04
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x32180737
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0x190ACAC5
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0xA80FCA27
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x83D87D19
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x27FA3DFB
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x3C7391F8
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x3ECC01A6
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x2C7AC311
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x59DDC6F2
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x4F1074ED
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x97A82AAD
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x5FC56BB5
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x54E3E9C9
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0x22E144A5
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0x488A1E86
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0x337D974A
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xBE00B29B
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0x8B8C92E0
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0xE20E66B9
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0xF9DCE67B
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0xCF8EFF06
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xCF19F530
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x0FA62F20

0x3796A4AC
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0xFE8C9889
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x15AA18E5

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x27696573
the morning she is calmer."
0x9A53E353

0x3796A4AC
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0x385F8762
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x311776C0
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x1AB22ECB
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x62F8473C
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x21739C47
had?"
0x92A0730A

0x3796A4AC
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x30AD6A8C
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0xDD8D5460
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0x74E082DA

0x3796A4AC
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0xFB9CB08D
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0x160A94EA
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x08D746C3
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x1F6759CF
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0x777B890E
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xC4387354
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0xA7B1D75B
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0xF9202E03
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0xF11FBC39
for both.
0xAA8065D1

0x3796A4AC
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0x03F9BBA3
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x2E8E8D0A
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x6D4830FA
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0xB5B7DACE
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0x0833C18F
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x440BFCDA
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x0115A4D8
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0xEF3A94EC

0x3796A4AC
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x27A4CD84
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x2B99D267
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x9C587902
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0xC43C5DEC
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x77D43A83
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x10C5FF85
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0xAAA4F358
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x26CB71F2
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0xEF066DEA
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x215FB52F
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0xB7B724EB
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0xF57718E1
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0x49165BA4
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x5CBEB690
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x32449A7E
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xA296DB4B
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x2EBE9F2D
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0xA4AD610D
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0xD86CEAA6
and content.
0x5794C96C

0x3796A4AC
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x90018CAB
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0x930EEA58
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0xABB29612
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0xCC8E637C
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x5A79468C
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x7C6B30DF
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0xFCF462F1
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xA447E6B5
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x91A8A8AB
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x302EF9E3
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x5F469B58
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0x093D4B8B
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0xDDBC839E
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0xF12133BB
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0xAC9BD890
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x7869E63E
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0xEEE8F3D4
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0x9BADB5EA
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x9E236E66
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0xD9D8E432
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x48BA8341
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x42A8B9B5
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0x324C857C
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x9D47BA49
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0xF26D1A19

0x3796A4AC
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0xDE4E6F71
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0xD852148D
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xEABC23F6
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x9B767E2D
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xC7C43BBF
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x187F939D
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x00EB81A2
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0x7904CD2E
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0xA0C7A90E
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x3CDB6075
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0xFE3E4AB1
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x83A68B8D
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x8FE56B30
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x3A5B8311
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x5572EE13
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x19E2CD60
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x678C5FD2
vary its clockwork regularity.
0xAF750D07

0x3796A4AC
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x2EA8D29B
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x0424FB00
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0x44BBBD58
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0xB82F5F99
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x6A86BFE7
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x4ED885C6
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x79E260AB
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0xAB740ABB
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x58023B2E
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0xB383F6B3

0x3796A4AC
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x53E5F789
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0x254BF446
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0xA4C07FA0

0x3796A4AC
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0xB0E6FE37
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0x4A0F0A6B
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x6E3AA135
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x18CD2400
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x07A3015B
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xDF9BA3C2
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0xF91155EE
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x14CD1DA0
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0xB6768CD9
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x5E49E2F1
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x82AFD855

0x3796A4AC
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x2E78531E
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x39D50349
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0xDA5FBF5C
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x389C0600
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x9671D09B
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0xF9D226C2
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x6967D8F5
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x720071B1
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0xB920FD17
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0xD7E57F4B
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xAE7F441A
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x4C0AF51E
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x4A7E793D
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x202F74AF
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x3859DBEF
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x138D67BC
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x80D98FCB
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x51FC5065
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x84E72F5F
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0xD8160818
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0x0544D843
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x382B772C
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0x52FCE9F4
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x098DE59C
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x716CB57E
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xE68B4536
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0xEF48CC14
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0xACD9F53B
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0x58C211C2
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0xC0C635F8
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0xEBA399AC
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x381E1AF8

0x3796A4AC
She closed her lips.
0xCC6BAA71

0x3796A4AC
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0xA150EE3B
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0xD3B56C2F
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x2F5072E6
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0xAEE89C76
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x3602CC22
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0xCFCE655D
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x8A0A430B
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0xB220CB55
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0xB4DA4102

0x3796A4AC
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0x7398D32C
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x75B9E6DB
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0x37639AD2
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x904754F9
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x6F529A64

0x3796A4AC
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0xCB800C63
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0xEA3E44A5
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x57CB352A
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x452D4E30
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0xCBCBA497
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0xC32A2823

0x3796A4AC
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x73293242
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0xE6E37F46
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0xE5201636
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x4CFD8F4C
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x9FC2C6D5
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0xB9902381
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x635505F1
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x4CC42063
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x146ED9A7
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0xC80AFA81

0x3796A4AC
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0xBD2324A2
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x077C6F41
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0x233ED95D
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x632980EC

0x3796A4AC
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x95F5F2CD
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xD1EF78C5
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x90464F70
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0xED862424
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x1684813D
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x7DC238C2
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x1655FAAF

0x3796A4AC
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0xEBB79CAB
her.
0x0FE3ADF3

0x3796A4AC
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x3559FD0C

0x3796A4AC
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x6B080BBD
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x8D86D32D
me--where is Bessie?"
0xE6743883

0x3796A4AC
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x42AB9FF1

0x3796A4AC
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0x1EDF0253
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0xA8260CA4
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x477DC988

0x3796A4AC
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xED36F1CF
identity.
0x4EFB3240

0x3796A4AC
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x369EAAB3
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0xFA86A63A
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x84F33A98
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x8590ED25
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0x43A52A16
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xB0359AF8

0x3796A4AC
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x7BF8747E
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0x35D76996
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x30F231E8
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0x3A924AC4
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x887F2454

0x3796A4AC
I assured her we were alone.
0x29BC1066

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0x68ED0CB6
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x69BAC3B9
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0xAC30A620
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x8651F82A
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0xFAA13B46

0x3796A4AC
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xBCB58417
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0xC2513DCA
of the last pang.
0x6FE7EBF3

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x1A467BAC
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0xD6169914
there."
0x5ACDD2F2

0x3796A4AC
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0xDE7CEE2D

0x3796A4AC
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xB9757A91

0x3796A4AC
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0x9C8FA622
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x9B00C79A
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0x1520B541
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x01265745
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x8AC4C65F
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x12344BB0

0x3796A4AC
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x0286F4BD

0x3796A4AC
It was dated three years back.
0x9490F890

0x3796A4AC
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x690398F6

0x3796A4AC
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x9134D207
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x32B5335F
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x1763B1B0
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x13C1B59F
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x5FDAADCF
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0xAAE1EC5C
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0xB135488B
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x7FC26219
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0x7841E1FC
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x08F3D144

0x3796A4AC
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0xBA822B5F
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x35E576C1
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0xD7138B2B
passed since that day."
0x68187E9C

0x3796A4AC
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0x28E6C95C
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0xFC0F0B2F

0x3796A4AC
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x4B828B49
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x6FCA5996
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x378F81B5
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x12FFA85C
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x765594E7
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x4BA5EF84
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0xA6AB3DD7
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x22C3C664

0x3796A4AC
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0xDBBE0EF6
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0x78C9BE28

0x3796A4AC
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0x6EAE765D
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xE60CF833
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x9F024419
violence, I can never comprehend."
0xB41461B1

0x3796A4AC
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x919859B5
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x88841294
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0xBF75262F
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0xB0983C80

0x3796A4AC
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x01852C08
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0xE030B9B9
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x93D9E6DB
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0xDD7E81B1
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x78F35F4E

0x3796A4AC
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x7DDBF0A3
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x7546AC9B

0x3796A4AC
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x0775C386
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x33EEB45A
she must hate me still.
0xDF5A1D15

0x3796A4AC
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x2F5D0A71
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0x3FB3CD17
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0xBE40D82F
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x0013CD23
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0xABBA3A94
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0x34FFB435
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x69D4A9CB
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0x7A4E46A3
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0x6E5B5E4F
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x4D4CB13F
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xF834F6DA
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x6037B4C7
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x9BF3D45D
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x57BE3DF6
form.
0x1D56F8E5

0x3796A4AC
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0xF71C7BE5
observed--
0x1B92C1AE

0x3796A4AC
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0xF7D0DB1E
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x7DE4DDC4
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0xCA5AD443
Neither of us had dropt a tear.
0x16A9DA52

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXII
0x6B420ACD

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x09B73D87
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0xDAC409A0
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0xB8366C23
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x52CA0FE7
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0xE4153F5C
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0xD279FEB8
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x8E6A09BA
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0xF52D7B12
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x02B2D55B
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0xA5C890F6
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0xB1F2BEE7
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0xD9614204
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0xA348B2CB
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x6ECFAFF2
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0xD80C8EC7
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x24609CA5
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0x89016360
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x79D16B9A
patient and compliant on my part."
0x47BD7BC1

0x3796A4AC
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0xDD211441
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0xF248218D
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0x9F1B7357
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x968BCF7A
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0xE0819C84
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0xA391F05B
notes of condolence.
0x9870DE71

0x3796A4AC
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xFB0CDD28
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x81A099B1
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0x64C40738
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0x73BB71C3
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0xCE2415F8
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x529D514B
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x2AC043AA
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0xBC9B5A01
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x6C869559
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xD573CD4A
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0xE9BDF518
veil."
0x90861C8A

0x3796A4AC
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x6F32873A
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x84CB7F29
good may it do you!"
0x2D92BC7B

0x3796A4AC
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x43EA0416
you have some sense."
0x30B18C10

0x3796A4AC
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x2793BFFA
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x7ADD6B8C
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xEA4AF042
much care."
0xF3513A1A

0x3796A4AC
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0xE6B25804
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x1B558FB8
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xAD8D5200
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x4A8E361E
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x57166699
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x17FC7CEC
fortune.
0x246800B4

0x3796A4AC
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0xBFD8704B
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x96466841
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x4D05B2EC
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x9995D2C1
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0x4787BD43
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0x6BE37E4C
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0xE12ECA03
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x0698C0BC
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0xD0600F58

0x3796A4AC
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0x706740D0
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x7FC860E3
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x22EAF3F5
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0x3DBBB4F5
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0xF4675CE6
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x8F9AA908
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x9DAB441D
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x0F78DEBA
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x98743F83
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x509DD34C
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0x0A95D1B2
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x4B1D4F7B

0x3796A4AC
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xDE9AE5E8
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x0C814470
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0xF3A67741
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x8E87F13D
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0x9BE48F0D
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x4226E4B9
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xAED95ACF
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x4D77698F
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x2585DFC1
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x5F3C2791
don't doubt it."
0x81E55F1C

0x3796A4AC
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0xCFAFA730
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xAB76812C
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0x4DF7A51E
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0x155E24FF
both her and me.
0xCBEB8BFA

0x3796A4AC
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0x662FEDBA
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x4D38644D
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x5F64CDB5
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0x52FC4345
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x125F1140
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x297F3A02

0x3796A4AC
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xB5C96238
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x982EDAFE
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x08802C3D
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x5ADB1430
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x7CD88F56
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x03D3ED57
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0xC4D69C18

0x3796A4AC
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x98D78FC2
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0xB770ACC4
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x5A99AF9D
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xE30D564D
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xEB99F706
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0xC9D76D95
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x76A28380

0x3796A4AC
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x4BC620EA
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0xDA21EE5D
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xB0BD3294
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x9E894FF4
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xEC774F55
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x96AB370A
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0x87F6C9BE

0x3796A4AC
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x234ED00E
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0xE09B06A7
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x198D13C7
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0xE84AD032
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x49D0B177
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xF5BBEC37
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0xE083743F
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0xF62BD53D

0x3796A4AC
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0xFF91AE03
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x33089EB4
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0xCDF102B4
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0xB4CE398B
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xA894FF58
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x4D33E6FE

0x3796A4AC
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0xE9622F3D
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xC307B571

0x3796A4AC
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0xA8C55888
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0xDFCEDDE9
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0x3116BC60
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x5735CB17
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x3B96FD64
behave with decent composure.
0xD1276394

0x3796A4AC
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0x8FD12B6B
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x0AE68D0D
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x8DB30E4E
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0x64F2767C
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x4CCFE881
month?"
0x50534E51

0x3796A4AC
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x5649B944

0x3796A4AC
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0xAEB0CE98
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0xD93D6B2F
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0xD1689FBB
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x7337147F
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0xB3E51669
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0xB4DCED82
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x79032B5C

0x3796A4AC
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x91D6BDB6
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x6FE9573C
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x9C30944D
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x0084B71C
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x57942B8F
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0xD11FAF86
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xE1046774
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x06A83FC1
that it were my home!
0x32C75330

0x3796A4AC
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x21057361
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0x34ED2357

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0xF7FA1133

0x3796A4AC
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x9E01B63B

0x3796A4AC
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0x4F5FFE7B

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x530CCB5A

0x3796A4AC
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x6C1CAFD0
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x12EBCA77
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0xACC7AE35
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xAC7DA924
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x8FDCB731
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x10A3730C

0x3796A4AC
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0xF383B7F2
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x1B96E10C
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0xACCCAB2A

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0xACBF814D
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0xA5F42F34
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x4B35DB82
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x0EB625AB
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0x2EB5FDDC
shed it over me now.
0x4562EC10

0x3796A4AC
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0xF83FB7AF
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x58A83E99

0x3796A4AC
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x95740457
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0xE8BF8656
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x3563F678
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xCA57F446

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0x2647056E
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0x3182B5D6

0x3796A4AC
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x7466CBA2
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x804083D0
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x7A5C5AC5
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0xF26705B3
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xCF2E4189
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x2B3F8AE5

0x3796A4AC
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x18DE8970
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x3962A442
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x5C3DBC50
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xCA5B78FA
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x74704F11
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0x4C4F54AD
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x6CCE0B79
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x5099B985
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x36B14D41
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x78618C80
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x0F8C310B
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0xF03BA38B
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x4A18AC8B
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0xEC929494

0x3796A4AC
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x9D245897
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x61790893
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0x8C75D3CF
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0xDA9FF667
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x676FA1EC
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0xFABF1D02
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0x9F8C7D48

0x3796A4AC
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0xB4A98221
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0xD6152728
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0x18EBC83B
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0xE522A981
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x3956720C
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0xAA66D60B
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0xF2FA938E
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x1793DC60
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x8A654398
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0x1D6C1EF3
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0xAB3AC587
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xD88D5697
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

CHAPTER XXIII
0x6730EB2E

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x9E0B2C2D
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x73D395C8
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x645713D5
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x2315D821
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x7B40B075
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x38A807B9
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x1620AB5A
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0xA98C492B

0x3796A4AC
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x4549B964
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xB948FB35
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0x5B45662E

0x3796A4AC
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x9A36DA85
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x8C738BB1
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x4D6DE0F8
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x3628EA0C
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0xD726D5DE
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x8DA05CE4
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xD98392C9
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0x7A476294

0x3796A4AC
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x70A0F0E6
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x634446F2
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0x4BDC2374
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0xC3DDDC34
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x85B0A7BF
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0xE2E100D3
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x565DB19E
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x6D36BE68
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0x7F1BFD98
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0xA5FC577D
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x3E1F95D9
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x1AF38996
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xE6D1AA81
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x91D5D505
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0x684C3CB7

0x3796A4AC
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0xCC12B651
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0xBFF469CF
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0x46A04807
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x4F2B48AB
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x4C1E5A72
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x1BA7BB53
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x5CE4EC2C
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0xBFFA1437
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x0B343297

0x3796A4AC
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0xBAC5BB15
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xAEA712C5
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x3231E6B4
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0x4BE56826
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xB6F7FF6A
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x576EC05A
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0x0F210D3D

0x3796A4AC
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x378EC8B6
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x03D58741

0x3796A4AC
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xC97CF3D7
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0x7C4C84BA
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x51439348
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0xAC9E671A
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0xC6B414CD
turning--
0x74A003D5

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x8F70B999

0x3796A4AC
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x13AF7CE7
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x7564933B

0x3796A4AC
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0xFD1643D1
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xED2F2789
there! he is flown."
0x1A841CF2

0x3796A4AC
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x3A5DFD1B
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x16F181C7

0x3796A4AC
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0xD6BDF858
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0xD6510AA6
moonrise."
0x674A6BD0

0x3796A4AC
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xE304CB84
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x00B47480
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x3CA49017
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0xBBA61350
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0xDAC75F24
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x14AFED8B
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x08DFD633
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0xE43CD452
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0xA5667615
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x99EDAF88
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x5B0DAEED

0x3796A4AC
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x77BA71BF
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x400486FE
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0xF8DF1228

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0x4E02B3BC
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0x8E50C8A6
Adhesiveness?"
0x229E31E1

0x3796A4AC
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x13C50B8C

0x3796A4AC
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0xB7002947
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x8EA58D7D
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x2F16ED72

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x9E8071B9

0x3796A4AC
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0x25647CF0

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0x0EB7651E
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x3E3D56B1
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x47DAA11B
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x8A2D8DB5

0x3796A4AC
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0xB1CC21B8

0x3796A4AC
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0x6585D393
must."
0xB537B5D3

0x3796A4AC
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0xA3A13BBA

0x3796A4AC
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0xE441B9C8

0x3796A4AC
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0xB90DAA06

0x3796A4AC
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0x343F35D5

0x3796A4AC
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0xF77D9AB5
straight on the head."
0x3D0E8B3A

0x3796A4AC
"Soon, sir?"
0xAD649502

0x3796A4AC
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0xDAE377CE
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xFC11B716
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x021711CD
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x2CA63341
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0xED3422B1
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x9DC5A2CC
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0xBCF5490C
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x951D411F
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x5C70A79D
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x81E79D8E
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xB320FDC3
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0xD4159F87
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x3769D2CC
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x5A8C5F63
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0xD1CC7148
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x00A9AB8E
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x7FF6C8EA

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xD53830A3
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x7A4DA65F
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x8BD2148C
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0xFFFB524C

0x3796A4AC
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xC24B88EA
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x704A4779
for you."
0x89285C69

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0x44D03247

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0x12CC8E9A
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x4D63347E
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x724A58B4
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x11EBA24C
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x0325E6FF
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0xF51F5DFC
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x0D5CB67B

0x3796A4AC
"It is a long way off, sir."
0xAD5E3249

0x3796A4AC
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0x4FBC8D3A
distance."
0x0D55436F

0x3796A4AC
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x70D30639

0x3796A4AC
"From what, Jane?"
0x59007A75

0x3796A4AC
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0xA0EED6BA

0x3796A4AC
"Well?"
0x855F2AAE

0x3796A4AC
"From _you_, sir."
0xDB8A459D

0x3796A4AC
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x5B9E8229
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0x84C69067
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0xA41FC2B8
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0xF4F5AD7F
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x5EACB6EF
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0xBD09E695
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0x3535D886
loved.
0xB99833BB

0x3796A4AC
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xD4C262DC

0x3796A4AC
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0xFA787E62
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x5DF47ECC
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x5467DE38
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x442FAFEE

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xF4681EF1
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0xA9930263
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x1F071141
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0xB5EA81EF
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0x72A80F44
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0xD22BAB45
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0xD7B0B0B9

0x3796A4AC
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x2AEAD1C9
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x4662DE59
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x667D4C6D

0x3796A4AC
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x2E131167

0x3796A4AC
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0xB9B71D76
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x6A557F12
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xF9763234
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0xB3A14CCE
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0xBA110E4D
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0xA3396E5C
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0xDFAE6D4E
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x110D5C0B

0x3796A4AC
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0xC6AE7C2F

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x9C322300

0x3796A4AC
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0xD37E8B4E
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0xE098F53B
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x86052A20
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xD30275A3

0x3796A4AC
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0x0661E1A1

0x3796A4AC
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0xFD81EDF6
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x9BC6858D
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x10CC700F
speak.
0x01F855ED

0x3796A4AC
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0xBB937DDD
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x9E6BA0AF
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0xAE9AD4BD
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0xAD7ECF19
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xEDAFB6BB
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x508C6B4E
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x4E8DD214
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0xAEC7A4D0
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0x7557E41B
on the necessity of death."
0x4A8477F3

0x3796A4AC
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0xF7F888BE

0x3796A4AC
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0xBBF896C6

0x3796A4AC
"In what shape?"
0xF751E3CE

0x3796A4AC
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0xD69B539A

0x3796A4AC
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0x477E65E9

0x3796A4AC
"But you will have."
0x35A47175

0x3796A4AC
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x286A249B

0x3796A4AC
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x057F6B21

0x3796A4AC
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xAB013BEF

0x3796A4AC
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x5260B3EE
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0x2D23E770
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x926BBBDB
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0xB44B0426
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0xC35BCB48
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x0EF10FD4
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x5CFFBAF8
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0xD4E92E13
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0xCA9A1F97
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0x05279185
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x7B0D3F6C
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0xDC27073F

0x3796A4AC
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x1A198310
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x914BF628
Jane!"
0x9BA2EFC2

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0xFC33AC69
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xFFAC33CC
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x39C7FEE8
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0xFC2E3BA0
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0xC57853C0

0x3796A4AC
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x086078D9

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x7C7253DB

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0x7A6D410E
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x98C4F525

0x3796A4AC
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x4EA14837
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xEEBFE187

0x3796A4AC
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x96F5B0EF

0x3796A4AC
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x7C0945C2
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0x643BDB56

0x3796A4AC
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0x711D9B96

0x3796A4AC
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x3A9F8B72
best earthly companion."
0x9AB0F87E

0x3796A4AC
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x230D6434

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xDC72F5BD
too."
0x9C6729CC

0x3796A4AC
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x5825933B
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x1AD18B8E
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x784689D4
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xDEC25C8D
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x7489B624
said--
0x873BFE59

0x3796A4AC
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0x4FA5F41E

0x3796A4AC
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0x07591E06
return."
0x246620DD

0x3796A4AC
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0xD6683F2D

0x3796A4AC
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0x00E916E6

0x3796A4AC
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0x1599421E

0x3796A4AC
"Your bride stands between us."
0x615B1E12

0x3796A4AC
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0xA767D27E

0x3796A4AC
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0x582AF5D0
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x509EB6B0

0x3796A4AC
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0xFD3696B9
was still incredulous.
0x98188A79

0x3796A4AC
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x6A8A4BDA

0x3796A4AC
"Entirely."
0x71306F1A

0x3796A4AC
"You have no faith in me?"
0x7862509F

0x3796A4AC
"Not a whit."
0x2AA78121

0x3796A4AC
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0xB5335137
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x292173A2
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x1013A1D9
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x1E0E6E84
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0xFC3D1F63
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0xA6FB524F
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xC3C048DA
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0xA340A451
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0xE546B7DA

0x3796A4AC
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0xD6AA1591
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x074D6FB9
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x7B3F2D93
given me?"
0x1CE75362

0x3796A4AC
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0xB89C7862
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x56AEF668

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0xA304174E

0x3796A4AC
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0x3796A4AC
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x73046381

0x3796A4AC
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x5A8047F1
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x45988160

0x3796A4AC
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x57C04CA4
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x04ADBEE0

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x8AAC550E
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0x6F47E9EE

0x3796A4AC
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x4541A625
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x01BD6990

0x3796A4AC
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xA09D346F
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0xF2B2BFB7

0x3796A4AC
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0xA4804CB3
be your wife?"
0xD2D34990

0x3796A4AC
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0xBB6DEC16

0x3796A4AC
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xAED96E9C

0x3796A4AC
"Edward--my little wife!"
0xE9F8DAFB

0x3796A4AC
"Dear Edward!"
0xCBDD2D1B

0x3796A4AC
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0xCAD6F215
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0xD644FA09
happiness--I will make yours."
0x28778ABF

0x3796A4AC
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x18B71C9C
have her, and will hold her."
0xA5932BB3

0x3796A4AC
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0xDF83C492

0x3796A4AC
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xD81CEC39
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x752C3D2A
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x2952BBC7
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x9DC5EA6C
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x04408293
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0xEE21F654
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0x48DC7323
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x4F8BF108
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xE9D45F86
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0xC28B0960
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x810AD48B

0x3796A4AC
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x52DB8C18
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x2D22C26E
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x044CC0DB
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x6A421A0C

0x3796A4AC
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x4433EC33
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x8385BF34

0x3796A4AC
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0xE2EF8CDC
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x3323E3DE
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xA0D27F0D
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0xCA904003

0x3796A4AC
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0xE326F5F6
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xEA68D003
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x69DDFBBD
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0xD836F257
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x9A49B0C3
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xE4D19ABB

0x3796A4AC
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x553E6B90
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x8F25908A

0x3796A4AC
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x13A66467
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x1E3DFD3D
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x8A9D121E
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x85344086
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0x06AB8AF2
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x67D4E2DC
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xD50F110B
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0xA68C8F8B
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x42120F21
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0xB8063B97
strength for anything.
0x9832C9FE

0x3796A4AC
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0xED30A525
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x08244A47
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0x02A5895C

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXIV
0xEEFF5ECC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0xA2EDF052
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0x83F0AD57
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0xDD71F30C

0x3796A4AC
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x15B7E63E
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x07B81E99
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0xC03898DC
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0x507E1F75
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x6E023CA7
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x7E0A47C1
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0xFDAFBF6D
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x5233778F
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xC752E1C6

0x3796A4AC
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0xBD1D6B96
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x906D0638
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x75F545C7
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x8EDBB0D2
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0xC617B56B
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xF21308C5
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x46634657
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0x489629A7
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0xF3BA5C1D

0x3796A4AC
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x1599441A
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x46C7E024
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0x357D50FB
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x2DE1DE11
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0xC20D576A
schoolroom.
0x3C734C5E

0x3796A4AC
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0xA5F02E19

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x2708E948

0x3796A4AC
"Where is he?"
0x12BDD920

0x3796A4AC
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x56FAF814
there he stood.
0x19443DDD

0x3796A4AC
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0x2BF0EF2B
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x5ABAA26B
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x58E7AC01
well loved, so caressed by him.
0x69E5C251

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x394487CA
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0xC210DA7A
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0xC32CA7B7
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xDDD4A29A
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x14F08538
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x0CC844AD

0x3796A4AC
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x4915AA81

0x3796A4AC
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0xA966719B
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x7F4F5EAA

0x3796A4AC
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x29B69EF9
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x7BCCA9D9
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0xC69883A8
think almost fear.
0xD6C5CDDE

0x3796A4AC
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x0142845E

0x3796A4AC
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0xA62BFC02
strange."
0xBB75EAC4

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x40DED844
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xEC152081

0x3796A4AC
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0x90C6A03B
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0x622F94C5
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x10886152
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x674E2706

0x3796A4AC
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0xCB06DF32
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x081EA333
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0x3033CB9A
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x8BEAFDFD
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0xD75A74A5

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x106CC9EB
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x996AE82E
have them."
0xF68F5C33

0x3796A4AC
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0x95365E2D
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0xED5B3A62
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0x6314837B
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0x56BF0899

0x3796A4AC
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x8848C734
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0x309FDDB7
Quakerish governess."
0x3FD7C772

0x3796A4AC
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xBBA14A15
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x6E22BBD8

0x3796A4AC
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x42248130
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0xEB6A364C

0x3796A4AC
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0x93B491AC
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x557CD695
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0x41987792
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x37D2024D
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0x7381DED0

0x3796A4AC
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0xA5102554
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x989913A8
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x02BD6F98
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x51B32D3B
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x052DC135
flatter me."
0x957BC98A

0x3796A4AC
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x5EB7428A
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0xF34081A7
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0xC85907FF
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0xE3D75109
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0x2AE6CF67
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xA5BF5F95
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x64975397
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0xA54369AE
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x3DAF590B

0x3796A4AC
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x0AB65E3C

0x3796A4AC
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0x8CF0BC0C
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0xDD200269
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0x2EAFA992
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0xC30735A9
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x924161C9
as my comforter."
0xFE1F7662

0x3796A4AC
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xD5868164
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xC9E39466
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0xECE5ED6B
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x9F17CC86
anticipate."
0xDA3D8B21

0x3796A4AC
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x2CA53FD1

0x3796A4AC
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0xFFFA3B16
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x7E7D0F18
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x52F93D07
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0xA7A9318D
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0xB019525B
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x379B1BB7
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0xD0912AF6
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0x7240FD4C
dear master."
0xF18D1A30

0x3796A4AC
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0xF2CB1968
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0xA462AC8B
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0xD95B8892

0x3796A4AC
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0xD660F00C

0x3796A4AC
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x03286811
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0xAA044F6B
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x5CE09681
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x87CDCB86
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x1159ECBB
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x99ECFDB6

0x3796A4AC
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0xB893C431
such an one?"
0x28158DDE

0x3796A4AC
"I love it now."
0x05D5771C

0x3796A4AC
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x66391F51
standard?"
0xAACC6905

0x3796A4AC
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0xFA2F66D3
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0xFFE0CDBF
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x5E170EA8
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x7E25CBB8
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0xF8D14E82
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x2A8C6753
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0xBACB5A89

0x3796A4AC
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0x924491D9
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0xEE99866E

0x3796A4AC
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xDFA28E2D

0x3796A4AC
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0xE416E707
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0x49112A8F
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x3D3A6CF1
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x81A65A63
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x0A28777A
pleasure to grant."
0x50560CD2

0x3796A4AC
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x87C7C3CD

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0x9C32C883

0x3796A4AC
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x832AC9D6
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0xC41FA2CA

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x71C57507
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x4CC9F3DC
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x92258DB3

0x3796A4AC
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0x8A26EAF3
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x61CDE004
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0xB561B173
withdrawn: try again."
0xB0405207

0x3796A4AC
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0xAD7BEED5
piqued on one point."
0xF405E892

0x3796A4AC
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x6384D2FC
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0xF737202C
request--"
0x4164660A

0x3796A4AC
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0x2255F558

0x3796A4AC
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0x0C093C3D
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x39C3AF91

0x3796A4AC
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0x183DC7B5
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x2751D7B4
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0xFCD35B88
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0xCC1C09FB

0x3796A4AC
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x887E0AC1
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0x7C515C45
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x35C590C4

0x3796A4AC
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0x1DD0C43A
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0xDC2274E6
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x441A7A1B
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0xE604D4D0
of my power?"
0x88992811

0x3796A4AC
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0x39B40513
up."
0xA6B8103C

0x3796A4AC
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0xEF9270F9
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0x9316C5E9
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0xEAB5EF59
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0xA463FB31

0x3796A4AC
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x24F2C25D
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0xCE5398B1
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0xFFA15DE0

0x3796A4AC
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xA976B181
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0xCE2D6BF3
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0x15589F8E
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0xF4B5064D

0x3796A4AC
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x342725BF
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x6B5EA44A
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x7BD44842
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0xB828185B
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0xBD28986F
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x96C9841B
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x5B3669B6
made me the offer."
0x38B16FED

0x3796A4AC
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x4D1DD182

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x7410E924
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0xB6948455
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0xF1F99D25

0x3796A4AC
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x5073CB0F
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x9B0F31AA
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x9421CACD

0x3796A4AC
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xFDE52A94
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x4D02C0B2

0x3796A4AC
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x8F761D64
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x9CB68F89
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x7D444F3E
deserted?"
0x76345223

0x3796A4AC
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x5DDDBB2D
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x7C64D0C0
moment."
0x111D7E31

0x3796A4AC
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0xE04890FC
principles on some points are eccentric."
0xE3567EB8

0x3796A4AC
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0x99865635
awry for want of attention."
0xEF48C1F0

0x3796A4AC
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x799E0E3E
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x58C7F851
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x146F8EC9

0x3796A4AC
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0xC6028103
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x6CA229EF
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0xB5002D68

0x3796A4AC
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x4026122E
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x5FB6D0AE
express.
0x8793331C

0x3796A4AC
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x360FE35C
entreated, and to yield."
0x5B48D19D

0x3796A4AC
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0x1E34AAA0
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x4E37265E
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0xA9E6DA1F
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x17B14010

0x3796A4AC
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x40ACE5FF
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x4B40A462
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x35382390
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0xADCA9FD5

0x3796A4AC
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0xFA2F0973

0x3796A4AC
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x3678A31A
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0x43636D2B

0x3796A4AC
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x5F49CF85
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xBA52FEE3
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x24CF39E6
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0xC1EB723E
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0xC7E929C1
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x8D82FC01
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0xE08156BB
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x515EEAE9
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x4FE761AC
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0xAE9A61E4

0x3796A4AC
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0x40901C10
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x36D72403
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0xF72C1883
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x7C552DC1
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0xC005F5A4
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xF7041F67
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0x02E1C2EC
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x703A6A8E
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x28B9F1D4
you would be his wife."
0x4DCEC706

0x3796A4AC
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x7E8F80AE

0x3796A4AC
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0xFE9AA18D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x3FC09DC8
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0xB20FF159
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0xD3053395

0x3796A4AC
"He tells me so."
0x62BE1698

0x3796A4AC
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x5526CB29
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0xE7004686

0x3796A4AC
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x6D6AE7D8
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0xD7DA5E05
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x24679130
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x30A5B5AE
father."
0xA34749FB

0x3796A4AC
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x599218D0
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x9ACEC5E4
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x9B3A1C65
twenty."
0x47DD06BB

0x3796A4AC
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x8691853B

0x3796A4AC
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0x4118BEA1
eyes.
0xE44CD918

0x3796A4AC
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x0E0FCFE4
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x8042FF58
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x0DA3FFAD
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0x6C39AD48
I expect."
0xA80E92C7

0x3796A4AC
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0x6DBF9F49
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x346E3D1A

0x3796A4AC
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0xA24E2B88
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x198C2E2C
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xA0AFB010
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x4F6D72E0
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x92A42675
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0xA10F04DE
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0xEF4E7DA0
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x6B84DB8F
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x64B150FE
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x8C420ECB
him."
0x9119B9FC

0x3796A4AC
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x688BD0B6
that all was right."
0xF51D94AF

0x3796A4AC
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0x994489C4
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0xF686D2C1
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xF332E05E
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0xF63BA233

0x3796A4AC
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0x0D5322D4

0x3796A4AC
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0xFB2F5201
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xCBB0A6F2
me go mademoiselle."
0x5EF03D5E

0x3796A4AC
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0xC7FB90D3
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0xFE9FD9D1
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0xC98691A8
backwards and forwards.
0x46C5F768

0x3796A4AC
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0xBB77D296

0x3796A4AC
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0xC2D0E8F9

0x3796A4AC
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x184A4340

0x3796A4AC
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x58BAFE6A

0x3796A4AC
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x02BC8263
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x6C2F7410
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0xA737F8EF
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x23A0EA5E
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0xF4F8BDCA
my face.
0x434A5498

0x3796A4AC
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x54DFC9E3
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xB533AB24

0x3796A4AC
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x8DEBE128

0x3796A4AC
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x2A3A0F6D
to Adele.
0x44A0B951

0x3796A4AC
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x326F7597

0x3796A4AC
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x5F99F8E8
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x1B059976
company--for life."
0x8AA4D895

0x3796A4AC
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0xCB16265B
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x6EC47C38
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0xC2D35A80
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x5BC5A489
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0xFFCB4136

0x3796A4AC
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0xF516996B
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x9AFEBA41

0x3796A4AC
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0xC4F3E688
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xA3B09754

0x3796A4AC
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x0230CD5E
mademoiselle?"
0x1D3100AA

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xD072EF3B
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x4035F3AB
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0xBF2FB331
there, and only me."
0x366E667E

0x3796A4AC
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xE4A74ACB

0x3796A4AC
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0xAF430915
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x25655FA1

0x3796A4AC
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0xA04CACCD

0x3796A4AC
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x7C99C06C
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0x2FFD5CC5

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x9A0ACB65
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0x2D6D7C20

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x3E4A2776
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0xBB87F886
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x666B25E5
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0x582424BF

0x3796A4AC
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0x3E95AE25
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0xB12EF175
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x919B1E9D

0x3796A4AC
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x22187CEB

0x3796A4AC
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x0BED3B12
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0xE883966E

0x3796A4AC
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x104FBA6B
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0x7C6AAFA7
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0xE1D1A537
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x04DAD43E

0x3796A4AC
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xFB4ACFDE
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0x66AE0BC7
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x729F7F71
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0xBF1E7B6C
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0x0F4FF9C8
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x20AEAD50
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0xB2EFEC77
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0xB30AAB8F
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x14CB7665
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xA5529972
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x342BB827
effect--
0x37C80858

0x3796A4AC
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0xE09A19F8
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xF177FA0F
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x86C810B4
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x8FB67635
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0x26EFD902
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x632AE955

0x3796A4AC
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x7C94400F
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x261E3FD0
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0xBC5EF4F1
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xBBA08339
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x09AA94D5
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0xA14BB1F6
again."
0x3D037652

0x3796A4AC
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x5009C85E
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0xDA22AE63

0x3796A4AC
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x8C1AE8FA
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x46E30BC9
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0xA30662F1
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x3B23AB3C
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x2E110531
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x23BFA5BE
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x7EA5D50E

0x3796A4AC
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0xB8705303
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x97368D88
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x02E03D2E
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x16582E98
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x6E513880
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xA77DFBCF
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x1279BE07
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0xE081DBD5
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x5D392FA0
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x4B4ADFBC
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x484425DB
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x0FAD98C7
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x8195CAE6
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xDC93AC75

0x3796A4AC
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xB4EB9DF4
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x9C1A3FDE
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0x8D9FEC5A
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xDA059F11
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xAE1F7799
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0xDBBB38CC
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0xFBA21839
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0xB5AB91CF
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0xCFC81DA6
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x038CD9F7
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0xC0AC3A32
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x76C1705A
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x73B9C85D
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0xD27FC278
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x30529505
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x8A03126E
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x4CC7FEBD
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x1CF60536
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x97FBF633
passionate pressure.
0x4E215D5A

0x3796A4AC
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x3FDB9539
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0xBA47BBEC
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x686346C8
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x2E19DC9A
satin."
0x2565B226

0x3796A4AC
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x2E829716
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x46332D5C
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x505C67C5
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0xA68CE3CF

0x3796A4AC
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0x99922EA6
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x5D7F081C
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x7557142B
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x3949F59B
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0x259F7E42
satisfactorily here."
0xAB38246E

0x3796A4AC
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0x678709B6
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x3D860196

0x3796A4AC
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x7F696A35
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0xB58B8945
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0x2561329C
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0x7DB00545
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x98FA0675
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x8FA18724

0x3796A4AC
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0x754D0227

0x3796A4AC
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0x63BF773D
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x1134FBA1
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0xE06FC8D3
would be to violate its conditions."
0xCAC74F2C

0x3796A4AC
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0xB377953B
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0x1BEB8B6A
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0xBA56B9A0

0x3796A4AC
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0xA9CC032A
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x4CFDA4E0
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0xC9084240
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0xD282D00F
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0x50927AEB
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0xC8A20D38

0x3796A4AC
"Well, but what?"
0x3DFA735F

0x3796A4AC
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0x2962899D

0x3796A4AC
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x24386ABF
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x58D4576C
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0x816CD3A5

0x3796A4AC
"No, thank you, sir."
0x04F79B9E

0x3796A4AC
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0x8FB802B4

0x3796A4AC
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0x1B2F17FD
till--"
0xDBA83721

0x3796A4AC
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0x1CA73683

0x3796A4AC
"Till I can't help it."
0x7CC3E35D

0x3796A4AC
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0x57EAE1F4
companion of my repast?"
0x2DA73144

0x3796A4AC
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0xD39F073D
usual for another month."
0x08B8CEAF

0x3796A4AC
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0x9C640C38

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0x78AF7FA1
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x24B2D6E0
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0x65596477
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0xC221A3DD

0x3796A4AC
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x6F64211F
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0x7BB1B816
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0x5F12F22B
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0x42BE45DC
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0xC07C4F97
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x01DE06F6
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x0CEC5914
my jewel I should tyne."
0x335D7C5F

0x3796A4AC
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x0FBF527F
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x24E086A1
retreat upstairs.
0x8A598E02

0x3796A4AC
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x5627626D
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0x7A7D000C
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0xC19F86DF
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x1895B69A
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0xB6432837
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0xEB0D353E
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0x19464095
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x3D53511B
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x250913AB
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x0A32D796
the present.
0xF4BB41E9

0x3796A4AC
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x54522734

0x3796A4AC
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x105E83A4
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0x31F63F14
stimulate it.
0x3B630CF8

0x3796A4AC
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x5BD94158

0x3796A4AC
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x8A46D558

0x3796A4AC
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x4AE4DC4F
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0xEBB23340
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0xC0A0E24B
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x446AFF85
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x18791537
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0xFC5E5821
strain:--
0x5C0B6228

0x3796A4AC
   "The truest love that ever heart
0x1FF6F19D
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x7747441A
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0xF80BADA0
      The tide of being pour.
0x06A8EB77

0x3796A4AC
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x60837300
      Her parting was my pain;
0xF2DECC0D
   The chance that did her steps delay
0xA7D9169A
      Was ice in every vein.
0xD2FE8EA5

0x3796A4AC
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0xD32A0AE2
      As I loved, loved to be;
0xE3086EEA
   And to this object did I press
0xB6736EC5
      As blind as eagerly.
0xD4F68D5A

0x3796A4AC
   But wide as pathless was the space
0xDDB6D79E
      That lay our lives between,
0x78075E68
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0xA258F652
      Of ocean-surges green.
0x4A2B6EB4

0x3796A4AC
   And haunted as a robber-path
0x499323ED
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x7C6BAE9E
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x1FD3E3B2
      Between our spirits stood.
0x7C954A9F

0x3796A4AC
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x22246485
      I omens did defy:
0x1D35B443
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x5C6D7265
      I passed impetuous by.
0x023D0BA9

0x3796A4AC
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0xDDAE210C
      I flew as in a dream;
0xD16E6B5B
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0xBF99BD8C
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x0021AE90

0x3796A4AC
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xAF43D912
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x3DD666F0
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xF5E465AF
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x9D6F0050

0x3796A4AC
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x2DAE4809
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x6C6372E0
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0x29ACC50C
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0xC1F395E9

0x3796A4AC
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x08C72188
      Right, bar approach to me,
0xA37ED2A4
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x22B8E767
      Swear endless enmity.
0xD73C45A3

0x3796A4AC
   My love has placed her little hand
0x41109AEB
      With noble faith in mine,
0x8AA1DCE9
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x8704DA59
      Our nature shall entwine.
0xFC872E21

0x3796A4AC
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x911CFC46
      With me to live--to die;
0x0CE63DDD
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xF27B6777
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x8489FB40

0x3796A4AC
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xF2DA39F2
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x7AFF6F11
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0xDC9F48C0
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0xC1CD072C
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x25D41862
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0x7F71ED2C

0x3796A4AC
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x3FEB4906

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0xA170FF52
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0x947E9FB5
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0xB9DCC6CA

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0xE7B5FEFE
Death was not for such as I."
0xC88F68C5

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x0F3F94C6
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x00671F76

0x3796A4AC
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0x692E177B
reconciling kiss?"
0xFF2F49E6

0x3796A4AC
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x2F6DB748

0x3796A4AC
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x24F4FF23
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x26CC22F6
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x107A7E74

0x3796A4AC
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x493676EF
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0xEBCC5B63
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x2547815E
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0xBBEF2C4D
time to rescind it.
0x09AEF533

0x3796A4AC
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x0518278E

0x3796A4AC
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x078D44B7
myself I was doing that now."
0xFD7E33FE

0x3796A4AC
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0xF6A028A1
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0xC8236A47
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0xC5DC51BE
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xA290B1F9
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x692E07E8
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x747558C1
advantage."
0x62591A5A

0x3796A4AC
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xE54B1B92
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0xB18BBAC4
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0xEE3DC24C
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x4A0EA808

0x3796A4AC
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xE8776A53
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xEDBE2813
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x0CC0E6FF
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0xE3B03605
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x12DC0D5B
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x90898D15

0x3796A4AC
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xA7DD236B
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x929DCE18
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0x5E496C8B
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x4497CC0B
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0xEBB71C40
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0xC15E51C6
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x4D19AB39
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0xEF4E2FF6
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x72338F54
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0x6295D60B
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x997A6668
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0xFEDCB930
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x76199748
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0xA2A64429
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x4F9D96B0
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x50C6929A
virtue, another must be devised."
0x693B1187

0x3796A4AC
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0x4DE3CFB6
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0xD03C1043
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0x10623F27
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x9BC57B16
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x0E698E86
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0xC2DCB83D

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x2F9B764A
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x95F14F17
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x589BC65F
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x807EF3EF
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0x0272C50B
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x0F3CAFE2
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0x31C1D8B6
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x5A71BD85
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0xB7B87093
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x0450ED47
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x3C1EC556
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x9A026835
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0xECAFCAC8
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x09D79FF7
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x54BF51E8
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0x736F2C13
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0xCEED4117
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0xF8137396
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0xE31FFFD2
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0xB424DAA6
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x7F097034
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0xF82700EF
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x4E48AEBE

0x3796A4AC
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0x590C78A9
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x9B7908DC
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x1257F65F
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x60B2D29E
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0xE4EA11F4
more than they.
0x18DB88A7

0x3796A4AC
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x272F724E
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x641710D3
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x4D080E4C
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0x49463805
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0x91BD4D6D
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x96D0CDCE
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0xDCEC3BB5
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x3E48F414
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0xA351A2E4
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0xAD29B2C0

0x3796A4AC
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xB5CDFB01
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x638796DB
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x06662AB5
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x2D2622DB
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xFAE53E53
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x1D2E6F6E
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0xF2361880
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x2C997D70

0x3796A4AC
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x8A53371A
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x1CC4246E
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x7974F4D0
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x01E77C4F
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x2AA62AC7
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0x2FD07D04
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x706A5274
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x589123AB
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x3B5FE804
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0xD1B82A1E

0x3796A4AC
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x1DD52E4C
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0xBA58D7D8
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0xE4ACB53F
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x541AC12E
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x59BDED43
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x6AE628E3
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0xCCC83B48
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x3E2E591B
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0x4FFBA9C7
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0xCBCAAB2C
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x744B2E71
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x8E1CC8F0
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x3496E093
listen to, and I ran off again.
0xFA8153F4

0x3796A4AC
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0xEB338477
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0xCB70210C
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x4404EFB9
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0xDDB4E260
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0xD9CE239E
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0xD3D5BB5D
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0xAD5DF20B
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0x7DB5AABC
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0x52AE32A9
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x22AAE03B
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0x7CC4F770
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0xD3E40DCB
simultaneously struck ten.
0x00D1512A

0x3796A4AC
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x8BC82E26
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x37F0DB61
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x7053F041

0x3796A4AC
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0x820496CE
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xD9F86C55
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0xD79C9038
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0xB38A0596
by one moving speck.
0x9E26CF77

0x3796A4AC
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0xCB36CE11
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xCE7B81A2
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x7D0EC0EE
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0xBB96470D

0x3796A4AC
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x9E33678F
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0xA5E8AF48
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x5AEAEE85
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0xA78E0A7D
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x13B9EBE5
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0xB5605F0C
meridian, and must now decline.
0xD5061770

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x737992F6
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0x442A7AD8
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0x59B0D1F2

0x3796A4AC
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0x0FA003C0
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xA7C06E92
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0x6478E90C
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0xFBF1C212
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x9896573C
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0xEA678502

0x3796A4AC
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xE8B3121D
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x12BEEC6D
give me both hands: mount!"
0xD0E711E7

0x3796A4AC
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0xEFEB73C8
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x35F3D994
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0xAEA0D9FF
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x13167BAB
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0x1C18F5A2

0x3796A4AC
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0x89285C58
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0xBF1BA20A

0x3796A4AC
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0xD39CA671
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0xCE5C84B7
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x184C5C1A

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xA73BC22E

0x3796A4AC
"Then you have been both?"
0xAC9305F0

0x3796A4AC
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x4D7FBFAD
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x7AD4BF36

0x3796A4AC
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x608C5366
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0xE647C0F6
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0xD98756ED
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xD516D740
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xD76FACCA
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0xD318F9CF

0x3796A4AC
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0x8252135F
get down."
0x272A0182

0x3796A4AC
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x3D698C68
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x6A0887F0
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xDF19A97C
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x5F728A02
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x13108600

0x3796A4AC
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x66F3901D
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0xB7952023

0x3796A4AC
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xA68B1632
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0x7A91C01B
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xF13D478E

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0xB379154E
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0xAA975177

0x3796A4AC
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x45E575B3

0x3796A4AC
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x3ED66023

0x3796A4AC
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0x33018C24
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x79A61113
as a long, strong arm.
0x23798A23

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xD448E4D0
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x8FF3D57F

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Jane."
0x6C0F5E3A

0x3796A4AC
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0xE0D23462
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x3A001FA8

0x3796A4AC
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x4443073D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x4E3A7A89
my wedding."
0xB584A950

0x3796A4AC
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0x6D37DC62
no wish to go to bed."
0x815237B0

0x3796A4AC
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x969928E6

0x3796A4AC
"All, sir."
0x8F97DCA2

0x3796A4AC
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xD0B1E7B7
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x9F59F8DB
from church."
0xFE6859C7

0x3796A4AC
"Very well, sir."
0x8B347D2E

0x3796A4AC
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0x84C05E33
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0xF45451A6
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0xC97831FA

0x3796A4AC
"I believe I am."
0x1D3D9D08

0x3796A4AC
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x18321186

0x3796A4AC
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xAED15AFC
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xAC55258E
charged?"
0x59644560

0x3796A4AC
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0x580E11B1
over-fatigued."
0xE4A18104

0x3796A4AC
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0x55FCC3EA

0x3796A4AC
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x1E9E6C74

0x3796A4AC
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0x9AC95551
and flushed.
0x15CAE75F

0x3796A4AC
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xC35B04FB
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xFBC7ECCC
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x2B31CDA3

0x3796A4AC
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x67A0773F

0x3796A4AC
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x24878669
new life into which you are passing?"
0x6F98DB1B

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0xFE4483C1
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x56B93507

0x3796A4AC
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0xE323DE98

0x3796A4AC
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0x5E10C0A5
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0x6107DEE3
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0xE661D1A8
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0x1D752A79
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0xADDCE8EB

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0xDD932C76
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0xFE97E01A
proceeded.
0x59F236A1

0x3796A4AC
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0x4B4B0585
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x18984849
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x083CD47D
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xCCEF192B
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0xFB97385D
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x44EE5E03
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0xF08B70C1
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x01ADA9F2
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0x3CBC0FC0
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x17F2FBD3
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x04661137
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0xEB5479C5
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0xC8D9F01D
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xD65AC3F0
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x1CB80B12
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x716EA12C
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0x724DDEBF
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0xAC4A2124
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x1C22B341
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0xB2F10B1F
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0xD0BDF934
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0x130BB19E
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x6A9A779B
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0x88F63023
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x0813690C
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0xA189B251
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x4BA16EDF
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0xC1AF6596
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x5CB45871
coronet."
0x91229163

0x3796A4AC
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xEE11A38F
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0xDC489FD8
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x62AF9FF3

0x3796A4AC
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x86C8CB12
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x742A78A9
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x312C173D
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0xC2C0AC42
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x6AF0E0B1
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x5958650B
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0xBEA097D5
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0x001EF12C
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0xEF4AC754
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xC1A6D487
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x080A0DC1
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0x192376E2
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0xEC364179
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x47D211BF
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0xE60FA59B
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0x23798730
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x76BCF812
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x14D1DEB3
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0xE0F5F986
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xAAB53C99
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x2E9BF538
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x22038F92
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x87BEDC55
moment."
0x111D7E31

0x3796A4AC
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0xB4D598E4
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x36F79322
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xF89B5BB7
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0x04D96AC5
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xC18D23E4
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x029C3F86
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0xF84952D4
Jane?--repeat it."
0x878AAB32

0x3796A4AC
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0xAD1CD6AA

0x3796A4AC
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0xC68C68A7
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x3FB471E0
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0x3ABC8FD7
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0xB35DB2BF
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x54C97BC3
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x273688C2
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0x11FA75DC
incensed than saddened."
0x73A3EA7A

0x3796A4AC
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xC6A31D8A
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0x3DD2C092

0x3796A4AC
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0x9059A00E
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x88C6EB4A

0x3796A4AC
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x87E1E521
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0x7F3D125D

0x3796A4AC
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0xE721CBB8
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x8FC52808

0x3796A4AC
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x4774F4B9
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0xDAE0F314
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0xB40658A1
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x297C7151
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x6D334E8A
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0xC4D1B41C
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0xD29AFA8C
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x0409C1F8
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x1AD6B1FF
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xA8EABAAC
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0xD303D805
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0xA21C2C60
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x63F238A0
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0xF4654835
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0xE3AF4A22
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0xEB557A35
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0xD63D918B
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0xC1077C00
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x23A13624
woke."
0x4CCBC65C

0x3796A4AC
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x398231E9

0x3796A4AC
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x7B8E208E
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0x6B74EA2D
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x705BC2D9
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x7CEFCD6C
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x4CE33D9A
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x0872BB87
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x68CCE336
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x2EEADA05
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x34202DDE
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x964D5879
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x25C139B5
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x18ED0F70
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0xD44DC5E1

0x3796A4AC
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xA8231E31

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x99AE6BCB
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0xDE30A788
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0x17C1D20D

0x3796A4AC
"Describe it, Jane."
0x32500FF8

0x3796A4AC
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0xF4F69FF6
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0xC20CE379
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x05158CAF

0x3796A4AC
"Did you see her face?"
0xA935EBFA

0x3796A4AC
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x8F2C04AC
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0x585FB327
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0xCD2642CD
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0x3CD82925

0x3796A4AC
"And how were they?"
0x1A4502DF

0x3796A4AC
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0x8F82A2E0
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x691FEC7B
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0x7B7E2F09

0x3796A4AC
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0x564816DB

0x3796A4AC
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x7B55D9FE
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0xF23503CB
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0xDFD23ADC

0x3796A4AC
"You may."
0x1793F79D

0x3796A4AC
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0x312AAB72

0x3796A4AC
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0x1346DE2F

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0xF6F0ABCE
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0xE27E64A1

0x3796A4AC
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x02C53A41
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0x1B0BD429

0x3796A4AC
"Afterwards?"
0x4989491C

0x3796A4AC
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0x7A24905B
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0xFC49D78E
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xC25008E9
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x4EA7F6FC
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xCA329B66
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x21B53297
from terror."
0xC5A15585

0x3796A4AC
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0x94E0EEB0

0x3796A4AC
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0xEA2C0AD5
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0xC68ACC54
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0x848D2E72
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0xD23762B2

0x3796A4AC
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x33280265
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x736A35A4
handling."
0x6043AFBF

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0xDE115D69
transaction actually took place."
0xE1880030

0x3796A4AC
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0x125088F2
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0xCD733781
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x7D2A645B

0x3796A4AC
"Not yet."
0xA9B532CC

0x3796A4AC
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0xA16BB9AC
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xCD90AC8C
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x83563A41

0x3796A4AC
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x1E9CAA7C
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0xFA5A2971
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x66A32840

0x3796A4AC
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0x43DD5F7E

0x3796A4AC
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0x4ADA983A
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0xCFD020CD
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0xD6E87CBC
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x76F67B53
to bottom in two halves!"
0x890F5BF4

0x3796A4AC
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0xCAE1A349
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0xCACDEAFE
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0xD0E78146
might have happened!"
0xF8B336D9

0x3796A4AC
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0x5F09F302
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x4C1D2A37

0x3796A4AC
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x2E659790
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x698B5A7F
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0xD8C081D4
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0x9A421113
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x566159DF
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x63ECBF63
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x04A3C35D
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0xB8E05A07
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0x589248CF
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x7058D707
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x0A7183FD
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x5997306C
solution of the mystery?"
0x0AE2D522

0x3796A4AC
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xB600A32C
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x6D3F7601
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0x8290BF38
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x47E8CB44

0x3796A4AC
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x58C79FAE
candle.
0xE6736097

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x539E17E2
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xE3E8AEA1
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0xD46CB24D
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0xE23E7F01

0x3796A4AC
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0xB7FBB134

0x3796A4AC
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x2972109E
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0xB695185B
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0x181E945B
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0x1078ACF2
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0xD3D54140
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x07BDD232
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x89379462

0x3796A4AC
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0xD2782AFF
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x0ADABB66
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0x88786CC8

0x3796A4AC
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x5D756685
Janet now?"
0x120C97B7

0x3796A4AC
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0xFF2C54FA

0x3796A4AC
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0x29DAFE83
love and blissful union."
0x8B340B16

0x3796A4AC
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0x50B8240B
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0x9266C97E
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x07FA9163
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x8D9E41AA
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x09C5185C
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0x60F665D2
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x23F04F59
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0xA4BFAEBD
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x18BF7C24
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0x0D72734A
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0x3F6C4777

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xE37BBD79
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0x040D7C66
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0xFEF9F488
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0xF58DAF01
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x76909D7A

0x3796A4AC
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x86F4FED0
not taken one peep."
0xDD1F4AC8

0x3796A4AC
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x5E2A19E6
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0xB10DCB44
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0xF5533CD4
by Mr. Rochester.
0xCC5CD0E0

0x3796A4AC
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x12AB872B
so long!"
0x4544DE08

0x3796A4AC
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x1CA4637B
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x31B112F7
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x7B18D468
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x316158FD
footman, answered it.
0x4E1374E5

0x3796A4AC
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xA4842788

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0x18F13F5B

0x3796A4AC
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x890291BB

0x3796A4AC
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x31865A33
there: return and tell me."
0x7F42D8DC

0x3796A4AC
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xEA1726DD
footman soon returned.
0xC0ABC064

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0xB6779819

0x3796A4AC
"And the carriage?"
0xBD1E58B0

0x3796A4AC
"The horses are harnessing."
0x2A680964

0x3796A4AC
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0xA3A475B8
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0x388EB8B4
coachman in his seat."
0x706AEF85

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x96015E6C

0x3796A4AC
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0xBEF96BF8
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x1846C67E
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0xE286C804
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x58C7127F
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0xD4ABCAA2
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xE9F6820A
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x7211C27F
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0xA6CE46A1
and flashing eyes.
0x2C2ECFB5

0x3796A4AC
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0xF95C4BB0
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xF15F123C
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x81160EDB
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x780E22B7
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0x4206B4DF
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x4D337671

0x3796A4AC
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x185F2F34
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0xA31240A6
me, Jane."
0xBC4072AA

0x3796A4AC
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xF3895CC0
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x5A6A760A
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x7AD979F0
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x7EC5D39B
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x077D284B
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0x137AF1D3
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x0AA32635
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x16C0D07F
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x13CACFE1
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x2DFA8923
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0xEBD4D147
path to the porch.
0xBB4BFDFF

0x3796A4AC
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x3C251CC2
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x0F781720
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x792632A6
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0xDF591DE7
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0xC088B4D2
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x7F5F6B10
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x4F98016E
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x39508B7E

0x3796A4AC
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x76556713
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0x982F6759
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0xEB8B9C25
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0xB34FFB48
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0xEBFA2094
Rochester, went on.
0x8DA840B4

0x3796A4AC
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x324AFE24
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0xBA2051FB
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x785D629E
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0x8AF94990
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0xD24740B5
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0xFC8C0502

0x3796A4AC
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0xC4303A23
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x1BEF386E
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x903BB3AE
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x38C20377
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0xE78DC233
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x293C81C4

0x3796A4AC
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xD12AFE18

0x3796A4AC
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0x2554A80A
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x19AA271E
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x2EDB8C28
said, "Proceed."
0x40E98A5C

0x3796A4AC
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0xFC53E0DD
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xE8036D6A

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0xD1EF744E
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0xB65CFABB

0x3796A4AC
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x6AFCE967
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x3A8D3671
marriage exists."
0x4E0FD47C

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x023D65F9
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x48CD2A33
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x514B0C5D
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x9F2379A6
beneath!
0x30CEAA84

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x834E530C
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x1038F483

0x3796A4AC
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x97542550
advisedly."
0x6531A742

0x3796A4AC
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0xD25DD26D
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x1D3A4A1C

0x3796A4AC
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0x739B71E6
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x5DA28A6E

0x3796A4AC
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0x4B8FA5B2
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xE745FA91
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0x4E16E9AD
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x10597870
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0xCD12B8C2
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xCE0F57E9
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x848BBFC3
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0xFD41C21E

0x3796A4AC
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xA732FA94

0x3796A4AC
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x867E5C81

0x3796A4AC
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0xFBD33B15

0x3796A4AC
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x03FE4DDA
recognises, if you do not."
0x9878183D

0x3796A4AC
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x29A08A1B
place of abode."
0x351B4AE9

0x3796A4AC
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xA6A1585E
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x755345FF

0x3796A4AC
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xB181015F
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0x45A42CCD
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0xC2C52B60
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0xBA033114
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0xE3BB13C8
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0x8D316748
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0x8E5FA538
Mason.'"
0x7604191F

0x3796A4AC
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x24A86A0E
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x7139FD63

0x3796A4AC
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0xEE43E971

0x3796A4AC
"How do you know?"
0xFF6442B9

0x3796A4AC
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x4F925704
scarcely controvert."
0xC08EB7DA

0x3796A4AC
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x23961E9C

0x3796A4AC
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x5F5F5522
goodness to step forward."
0x9AB2C10D

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0xBCE175FB
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xD2D0DB1F
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x534A02AB
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x71D0E3EE
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x8D09AE98
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0x7D328327
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0xDCDF3C2F
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x7794803A
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x92CC8B04
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x3254916A
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x1D7CAFC0
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x67A83310
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x2D6F3BEA
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0x54A6E8B9

0x3796A4AC
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0x462563CE

0x3796A4AC
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0xB88216D5
what have you to say?"
0x5FCB049F

0x3796A4AC
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x6D39E73C
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0xAA2EEC5A
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x80CC1E7D

0x3796A4AC
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0xAC1E4DEE

0x3796A4AC
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0xD835316C
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x48626F66

0x3796A4AC
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x13B32747
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x64B78CA3
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x52B5D54B

0x3796A4AC
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x8BCFB5C4

0x3796A4AC
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x28CD6138
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x932E187E
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x30A1CA91

0x3796A4AC
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xDAF396FD
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0xFECFE9E4
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x31A4CAD9
obeyed.
0xBB4D894B

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x4956D5AC
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x2FCE2692
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0xA7F96310
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x12FA27DA
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xF210A8D7
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x3B281F3B
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x3EBEE179
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0x7D2B0BC4
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0xDD5B548B
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x877492A0
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x06A1907E
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xF3B47BB2
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x6BB6C7FC
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x96BFA863
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x6FD1A739
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0xFB402D57
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x3E7434BE
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x59641D55
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x1589D959
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x28799F71
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0xAF89511E
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x0AA93ACA
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0xBB57CA0B
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0xE87491A9
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0xDE759575
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0xA6BB60BC
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0xE9587EFD
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x5ED5AD44
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x7F7A81D1
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0xC0D21787
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x0E86B0E4
you--follow!"
0xBDBE3927

0x3796A4AC
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x2A548A60
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x4300BF33

0x3796A4AC
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x06F14C74
will not be wanted to-day."
0xFC2508D2

0x3796A4AC
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0xC2DC0D6F
greet us.
0x9234FDB5

0x3796A4AC
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x3A24B64E
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0x32E7A401
late!"
0x51596AB3

0x3796A4AC
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x360F55D3
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x84C89F74
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x8404E159
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0x494ABEDF
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0x0D743507

0x3796A4AC
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xF3D01134
here."
0x96D2795E

0x3796A4AC
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0xF3591E82
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0x6DA93C11
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0xF93B917E
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x157B46EE
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x6487740F
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x642E8C88
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x30AFA172
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xD13B510C
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0xE2877C06
mane, hid its head and face.
0xD796A331

0x3796A4AC
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x6F8DA4FD
your charge to-day?"
0x6ABF2CC3

0x3796A4AC
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x3152E522
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0xBC046CAC

0x3796A4AC
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x1E932F2C
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x8D2A404B

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x5F9BEAC0

0x3796A4AC
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x988CC2F3

0x3796A4AC
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x3C75EEF9

0x3796A4AC
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x5D235AA9
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x45EDD640
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0xF711637F

0x3796A4AC
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0x9345B8F0
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0xFDBDEF84

0x3796A4AC
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0xCFC8DB0E
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x11297875

0x3796A4AC
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x1F419C72

0x3796A4AC
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x78612404

0x3796A4AC
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x00EE90FD
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x35AADAA9
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xE7EB37B8
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0x3ABCCE4E
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x384F769D
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xE6AD826D
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x36A0A0B9
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x2F6CE748
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x6DD4EB65
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x211F9FDD
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0xB6BE4959
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x856E0D49

0x3796A4AC
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0xE11BCD40
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0xFAD22DB0
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x34F0AF1B
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0xD524EB47
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x65C77453
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xE2A2E0A0
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x27D7F80D
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x77694459
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0xF5613639
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x02F92D3B

0x3796A4AC
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xAE5A8B69
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0xFC475069
the stair.
0xC7AB51E6

0x3796A4AC
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x02F74C62
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x3795D713
returns to Madeira."
0x1BBB6D97

0x3796A4AC
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x3F9CEA25

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0x6DD5FCBB
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xBB015A66
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x2780165C
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x6C70EF16
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0xC6E866BD
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x6E582B1B
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x5947AB26
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x8AA295FA
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x82C56244
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xCA67EFEE
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x962B280D
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0xBD14E3B0
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x61D3A39F
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0xD5231D11
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x3C25A545
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0xC14B8B1F
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x2EA46631
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0xAE4272F5
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xB10AA366

0x3796A4AC
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xEBDF57BB
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0xD918688B
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0x886B237E
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0xEAF4609D

0x3796A4AC
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0xFD49FC48
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x9DC5EC1A
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0xCF6F3E2B
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xE0066CD1
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x4424CC70
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x514B8450
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x41863C98
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x3FF6AD69
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0xEA64D06D
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0xD96419E7

0x3796A4AC
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0xE9B6140F
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0xB4A696F0
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0xD6B53FFD
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x7786AF4E
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x2623B199
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xD2942185
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x82027E8E
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0x157C8127

0x3796A4AC
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0xD3C9A75B
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0xCB8C26A4
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xD4DF5788
prospects?
0xFAA3B1C4

0x3796A4AC
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x4F772376
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0xBF052A2E
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0xDA66A087
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x3E842375
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0xC6C530F5
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0xDAE28F44
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0x0FB1A067
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0x18197410
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0x3516CD77
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x91D63D4E
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0xEEA40131
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x8A487060
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xD45690DE
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x4FEAF6A3
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0xF799F165
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0xBD3C2D01
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x933CFD49
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x0B7B3913
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x7C721F97
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x1F0B72FF
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0xC473F2CC
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x6BD29334
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x5A15D694
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0x2E902546
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0xB2D4D35B
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x257C7118
conduct!
0x5DD26F04

0x3796A4AC
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0xDE42B382
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0xC01150A1
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0xBBE49069
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x8B12E413
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x76A7E5D9
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xD8750B6D
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x766D4F8E
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0xBD53BECA
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x25F9E4B6

0x3796A4AC
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x99AAEE6F

0x3796A4AC
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x4AA271E2
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0xC98EB708
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x6901AE66
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x90D55959
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x5209B75F
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x0910E11D
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0x5482F758
floods overflowed me."
0x1C42E1A0

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXVII
0x86417A4A

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x74C8074D
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x8B815D29
"What am I to do?"
0x1E37BC54

0x3796A4AC
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xFA8E2305
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0xF846AC4A
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x93013B31
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x76F1B915
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0xFDE7D8A2
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0xC4BCB65F
cannot do it."
0x12F319F4

0x3796A4AC
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0xE652E2C8
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0xA073B723
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0x74B56289
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x751F1078
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x7A08C767
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0xCC0948F9
depths of agony.
0xFB8D9D45

0x3796A4AC
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x51012C6E

0x3796A4AC
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0xFB39A95D
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0xFAC04055
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x94A883A5

0x3796A4AC
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x69E248E4
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x146B5D60
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0xDFEB2956
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x8C34180D
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0xF04D7023
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0xF2DAFF83
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x2B46E5EA
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0xFBD6D356
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x6557BEDB
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x650F59E1
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0xAC60FE53
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0x4552A1D6
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0x71A8E36A
threshold.
0x7F24E718

0x3796A4AC
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0xC7B31310
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0x6CCF1186
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x66F62F14
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xD48D75C0
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0xF48AE409
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x7C2BAC02
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0x11C03EF6
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0xD04C962D
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x66EACCC6
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0xFC8DC7D0

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x8DC83041
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x7B7816F1
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x21343259

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x03EFF054
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x085360AD
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x9A42EC60
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0x1447D12D
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x619D54DA

0x3796A4AC
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0xEC1E520D
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0xF5A35AAE
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x049C4DE1
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xEE5CEA2B
heart's core.
0x31CB17CB

0x3796A4AC
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x3E8AE85C
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x38AA202D
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0xA4A71307

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0x2C48E252

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0x547F165B
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x5DA321BF
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x48BF8B69
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x038BB144
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0xDC6A960F
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0xC2AFF40D
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x7915FA2C
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x448FD8AA
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x5AF695D5
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0xE2970B34
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x5E326142
him."
0x9119B9FC

0x3796A4AC
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x4C58499D

0x3796A4AC
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0xFCC3D48C

0x3796A4AC
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x83B6B7E7

0x3796A4AC
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x5CEEBC9B
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xED173851
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0x12B06B09
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0xBA84C318
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xE586AF46
put his aside.
0xE812A42E

0x3796A4AC
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x744A3C90
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x2D82BD59
appropriated?"
0x8857ABCA

0x3796A4AC
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x68713DAB

0x3796A4AC
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0xD748696D
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0xBC386E0C
rightly?"
0xB9773F91

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0xEEC11629
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x85502699
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0x51763D80
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0xCBD72915
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x4A49B8F2
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x69DD537A
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x189D6D2A
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x50B0CC23
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x7D74178D
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x44407E1F
know you--I am on my guard."
0xED60A4D7

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x7D92F706
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0xE2C88E8A

0x3796A4AC
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0xBA27A6F2
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0x278FE929
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x01BF290E
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0xB8F90979
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x3A9E9E26
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0xB80F4A35
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x8F5907AA
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x6801F607

0x3796A4AC
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0xE0624022
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0xA6186605
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0xCDB2203F
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."

"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x1CAF9D73
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x756F0B34
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x4606FE95
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0xF7571CE0
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xC5B762F2
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xF3693CB4
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x2D28772D
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0xE2AF4550
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0x24056C1C
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0x69F5ED6E
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0xA2F5CD6B
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0xED4142A0
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0xF36AE061
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x04751BA6
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0xD0B68DA7
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0x2DD79D07
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x681F9412
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0xB4EC8709

0x3796A4AC
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0xE88F54F4
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0xAA7CDC07
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x0D12296A
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0x4A4FD870
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0xB3B563C2
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x0D241CCF
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x639603D3
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0x2198946C
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x5414A011
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x28D3077A

0x3796A4AC
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0x09DD4353
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0x4AA137CF
cannot help being mad."
0xA719BE93

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x0073EED8
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x4A96AB0C
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x39DC3863

0x3796A4AC
"I do indeed, sir."
0x40A543B8

0x3796A4AC
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xAF6037B7
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0xFE227D9A
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x09708B18
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x1C9A62A0
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0x4BA114F6
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x29220AE3
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0x94A40E56
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0x994CA5E8
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0xD3AC128C
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x15520DB9
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x9D912712
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x63F8FA8E
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x1DB9E572
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x95A6685F
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x7BC77DFD
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0xAF84330E
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x0AB59EEA
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x05E6508F
falsehood and slander."
0x45CCFB53

0x3796A4AC
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xBBAA1C73
for you."
0x89285C69

0x3796A4AC
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x265730FD
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x3E82B652
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0x5865C6C4
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0x6915AD8E

0x3796A4AC
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x5C986839
too dull for you."
0x30073B32

0x3796A4AC
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0x479B879C
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0xE7C9F0FD
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0xFF093F79

0x3796A4AC
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0xEFE3DCFA
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0x29BF4E0F
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xC833386F
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x200F9618
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0x41473459

0x3796A4AC
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0x4BD78B55
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0xACCBD7A6
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x49B4AA69
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0x7766C810
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x80FF5938
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xDD7EFAEF

0x3796A4AC
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x116215DC
before me.
0x31099556

0x3796A4AC
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xA89495B3
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0xF117B785
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x7ADB1011
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x19A8DEDC
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0x9A8E3E56
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0x18C619EA
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xDB240901
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x55C39899
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0x4A061388
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x40193495
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0xDCE5499E
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0xBB09520F
soothingly--
0xB2AFC391

0x3796A4AC
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x5C9C3825
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x373DA198

0x3796A4AC
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0xB883FB79
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x96AEA678
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0x927427B6
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0xAE9D22C2
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x3B808C01
heartily.
0x95F9EF97

0x3796A4AC
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x768A0C0A
not while he was in such a passion.
0x7FD700D0

0x3796A4AC
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0xD45EA8F2
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x0F5F5F5E
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0xF50499CD

0x3796A4AC
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0xF4633E92
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xF1E451E4
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0xA438385A

0x3796A4AC
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xCE47945E
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x9324A71C
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x622AAF61
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x1530D67D
were some toad or ape."
0x6CED6157

0x3796A4AC
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0xAB3B4739
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0xA61E9CCE
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0xA5D9755D
where I had wounded.
0x86185709

0x3796A4AC
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x9636AAE3
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x27DF89BA

0x3796A4AC
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0xA72C43E8
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0x55A44830

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0x68D738FE
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0x1E930828

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0xAE0A8E5C

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0xA2D16F56

0x3796A4AC
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0xA59C348D
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x77FEA863

0x3796A4AC
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0xD9B8781E
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x461CF148
scenes."
0x30C0768F

0x3796A4AC
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x14DD0E5B
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0xD832E3A0
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xEA8461AF
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0x4CE2D66E
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x8D0609A4
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0xA7E726B4
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0xE5388B57
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x3F908810
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x9C9E05D8
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x7CDCD684

0x3796A4AC
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0xF88ED195
still I dared to speak.
0xEAF2D249

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x33889485
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0xEB758069
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0xCDEC2E37

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x40FB1619
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0x1A7342EB
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0x8DC7CBAB

0x3796A4AC
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xD24621B0
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0xEFDA3B30
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x3A4E2431
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0xC4226BA7
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x7F37DB33
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0x7EBF1339

0x3796A4AC
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0xA1C8C5F2
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0xFC9418A7
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0xFD57C991
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x7AFF832A
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0xA5508440
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x4FE46C6E
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0xA88D3A77
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0x1EB8E7FE

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xDA49081F

0x3796A4AC
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x36DB9764
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0x37185F40

0x3796A4AC
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0x3C719EC0

0x3796A4AC
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0x27D799A5

0x3796A4AC
"I have understood something to that effect."
0xC974EAB6

0x3796A4AC
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x6AEFFA79
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0x67403792
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x9F408E8B
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0xC7EB1187
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x88F516C3
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x97AE9885
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x66BB58FB
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x11924DFE
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x780B5B31
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0x6DC86E18
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x8ADDE644
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0x12172BD7
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x4AA49861
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x10C39365
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x1BED072F
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0x38809323
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x5084F8EF
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xB20DF2D1
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x9EE14CEE
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0xE30ADB64
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x95573D66
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x236F3DB8
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xDE0A2133
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0x69DFB005
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0xD1D2ECE9
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x00CBD9A0
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x988E46FF
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x1EBEDA0E
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x968C474C
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x73956814
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0xCBD99D88
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x2CE3FABC

0x3796A4AC
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0xCACF5148
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0xDF6D11E4
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0x95A6B121
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0x7066A4CB
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0xB566AB24
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x5030A250
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0xB7D097CF
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x71B825A6
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x88411AEB
plot against me."
0x1D9AD8FB

0x3796A4AC
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0xEF9F25BD
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0x74C6499B
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xAAA74A7B
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0xCFCF88B3
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0x5B3E1E7A
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0x27CA29FB
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0xDDA8BD39
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0xB87D746A
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x42811BFC
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x0F3E40A9
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0xB59EC3B4
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x0357ED63
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0xD0A4C52A
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0xAF0B6957
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0x725AE50A

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x5DBAC7E3
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x1B519E3E
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x9805F035
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0x6C33D721
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x1C397EB7
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0x2BCBC7FB
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0xBC79C30D
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0xB41BD5B9
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x5F5E5D84
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0xEAD39C1B

0x3796A4AC
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0x13680351
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0xAA1F49A1
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x2A979575
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0xA3A15921
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x415CB3EB
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x853CBF64
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0x84477D74
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0x2B88D355

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xC5429FE7

0x3796A4AC
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0x414DBA58
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0x08A8E125
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0x06DB9D99
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0xC831601E
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0x669B2182
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0x83BB0C93
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xA91ABA96
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x52EDF5D2
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0x524EF9F3
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x08D8391B
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0xC5CEF858

0x3796A4AC
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0xEC2F6A6E

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0x30489AE5
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0xC5648E24
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x179798EC
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0xF7FF0A78
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x1423EED6
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0xC120CAAF
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x835809E0
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0xC63260A5
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x5FA8986C
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0xB7C70B21
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0x1F27D1E3
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0xA8894B8F
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x55AEA51E
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0x787D6C4A

0x3796A4AC
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0xA992BDF8
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0xEF5BF5C7
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0x4864A563
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0xE2F4BED2
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0xDB90F612
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0xCE0BA1D4
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0x09C354F3
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x81BE6B12
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0x2583CEFC
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0x89792B29
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x8E969CBE
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0x38B9A067
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xD6122E79
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0x17D572D8
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0xE4ADC8D5
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
0x9007E679

0x3796A4AC
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0xB6B5A31D
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0x91538D1B
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0x0213A324
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0xAA74CDC4
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0xD9E7C72F
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0xBBE6E85F

0x3796A4AC
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0x5CD937EB
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0x937C05CC
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0x60C70C72
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0x833BA7E9
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0x0AB238AB

0x3796A4AC
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0x29B46275
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0x82312F6F
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0x63639438
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0x3A1052B4
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0xBCF4DC44
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0xC24B8780
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0xF426D282
follow.
0xB9C7EB74

0x3796A4AC
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0x70940316
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x7A63E2BA
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0xFA5A6815
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0x31A6D27D
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0x64D9A1D8
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0x3750C2A2
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0xA7BD13EE

0x3796A4AC
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0xE3FC8ED4
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0xF1DA8CA3
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0xA32F60A1
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0xDCEB85D6
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0xA8CD5085
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0x3117266C
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0x4BDC106B
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0xBF94DC93
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0xE8B172AC
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0x2588757C
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0x1034BA27
and leave her.'
0xA19A9093

0x3796A4AC
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0xC72C6116
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0x77362323
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0x8129EEDC
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0xA117F860
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x6FE742C7
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0x306345D1
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x9D775481
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0xE45AAB99
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0x5D4C2208

0x3796A4AC
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0xC0DD7F39
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0xDA78ED3F
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0x6D4688DF
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0x516D1F2F
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0xD9658F8B
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x9B54F050
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0xCC20DADA
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0x01BC1023
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0x2D765053
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0xE5BC273F
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x7635E2C3
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0xCAB8CB3D
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0xC6F07E9F
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x5B2A1881
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0xDE73E6DD
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x3DA3D9E3
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x82FB1E7D
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x664C2C68
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x191FA2FC
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x0086ACCE
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0xB0D67BF5
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x70661A3D
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x791E796A
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x317279CD
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0xA68D948C
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0x20AF14C9
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0x9EE803EB

0x3796A4AC
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xCB7DEF71
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0x20C375BD

0x3796A4AC
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0xDC0F9856
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0x5546DD35
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0xD335E3DF
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x02BE2C3A
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0x46C0E133

0x3796A4AC
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x434D02F7

0x3796A4AC
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0xAF492B07
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0xF07A6D92
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0xD72AADC8
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0x6F29AF02
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0xADB1D16A
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x08B9A327
burdened."
0xFA94745C

0x3796A4AC
"Well, sir?"
0x3566BDF3

0x3796A4AC
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0x27203B62
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0x34EC9731
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0xF576F7E9
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0xADA8D8BA
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0x16DF59EF
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0xE30290FB
don't very well know why."
0x9858DA1F

0x3796A4AC
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0xFFBC5F64

0x3796A4AC
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0xC9DF250A

0x3796A4AC
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0xCE034D8E
and what she said."
0x86B54400

0x3796A4AC
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0x57D1F270
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0x344A8221
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0xABED4AC9
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0xC1F873CC
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0xB33C971A
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x590E67BB
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0xCE405288
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0x93B0BD7D
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x2A4BFA12
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x4FC13C4E
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0x7A1DB1F9
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x3B59B227
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x4696B21B
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0xAB27AA34
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x0BBBBE93
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0x6F609077
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x19CB4151
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0xC80E9B23
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x2CE7AF2C
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0x026BA353

0x3796A4AC
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0x8151E20E
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0xE3832CB6
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0xA333C3FC
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x5A05AD7C
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0xCC34ECA2
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0xD928E684
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x3A76F553
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0xC387D8DC
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x659D533D
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x7DA80151
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x1B58A41F
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0x6A1A2E30

0x3796A4AC
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x17023061
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x38F7F47E
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0x1F73F2D2

0x3796A4AC
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0x5FF3EC1B
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0xC18FDCB2
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0xAD8BFD5C
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x74873BF3
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0xC6103AE7
Giacinta, and Clara."
0x1D4FFB23

0x3796A4AC
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x61CB8C37
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x127C4B24
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x4D148A41
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0xC827CE2F
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0xA42B4A40
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0x623C1A02
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x98C05CE3
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x79767662

0x3796A4AC
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0xADF9E39D
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x93B89410
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0xEE99E29A
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x727001D4
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0xE09CC51C
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x9D52BEC8
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x1462E80B
back to England.
0x5056CE8D

0x3796A4AC
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0xE011B8C4
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xB257CCBA
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xBB737BB0
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x88FAFBB2
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x0FEFD151
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x4878E646
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x2C988BDB
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0xB7D87C75
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x99023C48
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x9A2DA4A4
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0x0CF7ED77
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x917ED37E

0x3796A4AC
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x5E079253
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0x055316BB
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xE1533900
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x4CED6432
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x63F1AE94
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0xDD94B34E
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x5001EC1D
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0x5E1D8C6A
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x0E22E0C0
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x2ABA6EDD
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x8CA34149
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x5046D7A3
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x270B9952
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x061215CC
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x5E00061C
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xF05F243E
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xC77959E5
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0xFF77BA4D
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x5323D44E
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x7CA8C902
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x4C572990
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xFB35C4FA
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0xE06F7AEC
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0xD7BE8421
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0xD8550C1A
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x528903DF
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x17102F0B
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x4CF486F1
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x72CC53D3
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0xFB83FCE4
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xD0E942C4
out of my sight.
0xC48EF1F2

0x3796A4AC
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0x27EB6667
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x1B39B0DF
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x94F11E71
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x3F3AAF42
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0x0A4120EC
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0xE6727BA2
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x503AE76B
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x4F6076A0
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x242A4DD9
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x242690A1
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0xAB2607AE
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0x1A766174
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0xC51C4149
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x9DFAE7D7
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0x2B2CEB47
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0x98590C95
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x60D560BC
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x80E17AB1
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x1B9148DD
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x8F1C875B
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xA183EBFE
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x4CE87625
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xEAB2DA47
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xA3D6B417
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x71465B1D
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0xB11B26A0
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x36126907
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x0C5C220E
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x473C74AE
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x0AC0C0AE
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0x2B3AFD98
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x4C241F25
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xA87E4482
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x4D7658E6

0x3796A4AC
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x030C400D
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0xDDAC9D10
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0xCD27A080
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x6BE3396B
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0xABB2E6C7
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0xB1ABBD57
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0xEE7145D3
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x4A7CEA93
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x1CA80CED
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x5A465D9F
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0xB2740532
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x596229DD
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0xFEE52531
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0x7D6EFDC6

0x3796A4AC
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x93549A72
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0xD02A70B9
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xC520993A
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0x1D27D908

0x3796A4AC
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0xF9DAA23F
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0xFCE4C25C

0x3796A4AC
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0x35F9719A

0x3796A4AC
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x5AA999E6
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0xAE731CD1
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0xBF69368B
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0xF3962034
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0xB36EACDA
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0x1279B60F
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x8C31AA22
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0x94CCA213

0x3796A4AC
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xE6E29A6A
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0xF3E2F370
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0xD0B0B40E
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0x61BF4C8C
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x2B6302FD
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0xF72572B1
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x782A01A0
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0xA8EC9F51
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x2A0C672E
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x0A974060
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0xC980DE9C
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x25857875

0x3796A4AC
A pause.
0x522F8A5E

0x3796A4AC
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0xA39DF65E

0x3796A4AC
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x34582E42
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0x04B77E19
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x6D29E82B
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0xA84CD873
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x809B1E18

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0xEACF14AC
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0x19D3DF34

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x2387D7A8

0x3796A4AC
Another long silence.
0xB405854C

0x3796A4AC
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xBD1A20BA
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0xE718CB76
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x5CA0CBEF
and to let me go another?"
0x400B3F78

0x3796A4AC
"I do."
0x3C220A2F

0x3796A4AC
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x7BCFED14

0x3796A4AC
"I do."
0x3C220A2F

0x3796A4AC
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0xB204E8FD

0x3796A4AC
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0xBD77FC0A

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0xA6D6FE44
to love me."
0x3282F46E

0x3796A4AC
"It would to obey you."
0x7396833F

0x3796A4AC
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0xAC23E5CD
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x4DB56389
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x9BAD6348

0x3796A4AC
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0xFC5C70E4
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0xC413C75E
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0xB729F48E
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xDFEB7A98
companion and for some hope?"
0x925DE627

0x3796A4AC
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0xE8843DFB
again there."
0xF2F69C1E

0x3796A4AC
"Then you will not yield?"
0x27585526

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x9FC0E1BA
rose.
0xA3F289C2

0x3796A4AC
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x1C007B2A

0x3796A4AC
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x8D7616D0
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0xE640710F

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x625742EF
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x53F54283
will forget me before I forget you."
0xB4793725

0x3796A4AC
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x4FE4C253
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x7B556B18
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0xBF27CCBF
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x225A7BE6
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x50472E40
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0x61330469
by living with me?"
0x7362EF28

0x3796A4AC
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0x8772BA9A
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0x6C38AF7C
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0xE5C3E957
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0xB10CE104
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x00A67FB0
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0x8FDBBEF4
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x48D770E7
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x81E1E7B9

0x3796A4AC
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x2FA18156
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0xA71CE9FF
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x5B044C30
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0xE3AB9583
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x1B941AA9
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0xC711B15F
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0x5A023C36
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0xB1A56892
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x62E57682
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x614A6962
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x754F71BB
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0xF3016273
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xC75D424D

0x3796A4AC
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0xF239ABB3
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x3A55CBF4
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x57ECC713
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0x6D27F117
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0xECA75B79
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x12A6C91C
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0xC204EB4B
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x4A65446E
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0x63FB4800
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x87C3F9FA
strength almost exhausted.
0xE1C7D62D

0x3796A4AC
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0xEA203926
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x57FBB5A4
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x035F29AC
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0x40140AFE
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x175FB8E1
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0x24D0E800
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0xC32C1B20
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x06DD0909
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0xD97F3EF2
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x3908F763
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x4EF54DEF
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x8C454AFD
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x2C00B8B7
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0xACEF5A43
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0xCD0BD654

0x3796A4AC
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x0D1B28AE
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x5B606255
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0x1801A17F
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x6848CF32

0x3796A4AC
"You are going, Jane?"
0x06852279

0x3796A4AC
"I am going, sir."
0xD46107B4

0x3796A4AC
"You are leaving me?"
0xBD3BA61D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x541AC030
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0xB30BADFD

0x3796A4AC
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0xFE47B5E5
firmly, "I am going."
0x5AC8299D

0x3796A4AC
"Jane!"
0xA5F18795

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x100391CC

0x3796A4AC
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0xE2238489
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xE513EE97
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x51CFD18B

0x3796A4AC
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0xD8645B4C
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0xB8EAE261
deep, strong sob.
0x3BEF6FB5

0x3796A4AC
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x22CEC00E
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x464BCE30
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0x77BC4AE3
hand.
0x4E96A75F

0x3796A4AC
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0x841C5833
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0x640F76D4
me."
0x869F13C9

0x3796A4AC
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x3CA4D4E5
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0xFD4CDF3A
yes--nobly, generously."
0x5EEB1305

0x3796A4AC
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xED56F77C
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0xE4714A23
once quitted the room.
0x52CAC423

0x3796A4AC
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x82BC24DB
"Farewell for ever!"
0xCC8B863F

0x3796A4AC
* * * * *
0x8E78B46F

0x3796A4AC
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0xB84DE5F9
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0xD0E786E9
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x223696A2
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0xE3F5D9C7
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xE205464E
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x357F348A
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x200A1C1E
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x7340E20C
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x2596960D
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x6A95913D
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0xA0DECA7F
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0x0C240B3F
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x0DE02979
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0xA7E28AF8
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0x9F48BFA5

0x3796A4AC
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x2AC31B58

0x3796A4AC
"Mother, I will."
0x6A781FF9

0x3796A4AC
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x31009534
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x72C6E682
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0xDBE5A4FE
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0xAD8EFD57
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x9EC5CC71
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x12C6E099
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0x469DF411
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0xA7631786
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xAB43A3FF
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x8A979EE3
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x4DCE6372
from my room.
0xA175DC7A

0x3796A4AC
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x1181B1CC
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x84C145BF
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xA32569DC
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0xB5918832

0x3796A4AC
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xAAD1D5E0
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x129258D3
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x80BE587D
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x716E77E0
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0xFD9CA69D
to go in and to say--
0x84D43E03

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0xAF2E20A1
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x3C006979
this.
0xBBBA4124

0x3796A4AC
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0xCC469C0B
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0xA43EE090
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x11F52791
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0x13FFD3F4
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x2CE0A19E
on.
0x7D10AEA5

0x3796A4AC
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0x12511CFC
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0x21ADD3F7
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xA16F3C25
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x6192BCD9
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0xE902AD7D
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0xBEC26085
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0xFD8C7095
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x101327D7
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x1EF45B45

0x3796A4AC
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0xFE2218D0
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x62857233
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x96F86DC0
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x3A194E9E
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0xCFB7F9F2
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x5EF7FB1B
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x64664D3A
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x3126F44E

0x3796A4AC
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0x6BC7FC53
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x7FAAF109
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x1C9CC53E
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0x378BDAB8
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x5346C52A
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0xC17A3294
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0xFE8CBE5C
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0xBEA7339E
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0xE59B3071
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0x31AF90D0
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x63EFDBF2
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x8870F1F0
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x11F886E7
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0xA6979907
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x06825503
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0xE4B3D595
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xC6BF3082
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x61D67FC6
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0x51020CDE
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0x12EB1BF1
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0xAE214250
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0xBA10B7AA
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0x97631C5B
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x76CD057B
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x40772D53
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x7E1FA7F0
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x1551C70C
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x06E16181
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x272EB0E7
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0x1808D710
ever to reach the road.
0x98EEC474

0x3796A4AC
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x022D9F60
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0x8EA01FB5
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0xE5B73873
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x958191EB
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0xC71FA5D4
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x41E863B0
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x0963011F
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0xD83D5CE4

0x3796A4AC
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0xAA93088F
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0x2AF8A261
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x2847E331
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xE6DD6190
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0xD5AAA000

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x1FB61F05
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0x30BF27AA
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xA662A3E7
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x18E3D0F6
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0xB245FADC
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0x552F8EA4
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0xF1BFB7EE

0x3796A4AC
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x0B77BBED
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xD49A3BCD
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x16C130BE
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0x96C13605
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0xF40080CC
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0x6C7493AF
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0x6C9C6949
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xE892239E
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0xA23FD1D1
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0xC7294E95
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x4D0545E7
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x5597A8D9
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x9692EF00
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x230FFA84
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x7360F84C
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0xE7743F21
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0xFDCA71DF
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x2790813E
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x544D7FA1
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0xC86E32A5

0x3796A4AC
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x1A05501E
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0xC2ACFB53
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0xF7383081
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x1161E855
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0xC3A5BE93

0x3796A4AC
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0xBB0C8A02
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0xEA299BAB
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0x43CABDD6
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xD638D05F
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0xC1CDE42C
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0x0E039737
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0xA00BEA3C
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x7F4FE80E

0x3796A4AC
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0xE73B7C7D
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0xFA2A5678
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0xDDE08C24
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x9858CC5D
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0xC8A340B3
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x94D14396

0x3796A4AC
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xCFA2D14D
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x3EDD3341
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0xDA870AE7
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x90CFECD4
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0xF97AFE34
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x38F4AF2F
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0xFE99AA26
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x25FD2756
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0x26CAEB2C
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xF1A013D2
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0x6872D1FE
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x6B959C06
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0xF8FE381F
then chose my couch.
0x471A4352

0x3796A4AC
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0xF0AE2621

0x3796A4AC
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x125336D9
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0xBD1D235C
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x57674655
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0x7FE08E77
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x7BD70017

0x3796A4AC
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x32370F98
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0xC2FC4DF5
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x9019B0AC
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x26212D69
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xB0BDE69E
attempts to seek him.
0x9B3E9BB8

0x3796A4AC
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0xD3B52821
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x510F983A
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xC63F55FF
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0xAC9E84CD
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0x902C7B72
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0xB275E4A3
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0xC46F5554
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0xF1A2F2B1
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x53FDFA89
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x2C059132
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0x57BC74A4
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x706D1525
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x9F6F3AAE
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0xEFFCCC9A
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x7AFE9531
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x0EC836C5

0x3796A4AC
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0x6E9F0841
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0xD550EF8D
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x1F268F96
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x21674BB2
looked round me.
0x056A00EF

0x3796A4AC
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x023A23AD
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x913C8CEB
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x482E957D
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0x93317EAC
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x9E999BE6
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x6FD7F4A2
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x8285698B
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x7D8C0E05
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x013F3A86
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xCD6C6D85
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0xA9651E06
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x94BBF25E
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xFAE7B183
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0xF609FC01
out.
0xCE0695CB

0x3796A4AC
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0x29E96B54
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0xA420E866
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x7418A036
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0xA05367DC
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x5AD6ED3A
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0x9EC6E1E1
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x7361A049

0x3796A4AC
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x7BB646E3
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x3FBCE0F2
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0xBD015D6D
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x2201905D
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x63116425
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x03AC0E64
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x0FBE2E8C
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0xB8045014
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0xC07FB1FB
like the rest.
0x46D518EA

0x3796A4AC
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0x0136538B
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x654D15B1
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x7D0B402A
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x8A3C71B2
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x9D9F0B14
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0xA0F74008
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x6FD4C582
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x22CD26A4
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0xF394380D
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x9D7EE461
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x34770ABA
would not; but I must try.
0xB1AE5679

0x3796A4AC
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x3992896F
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0xB1ACCE32
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x93C7CBA6
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x27972DF0
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x5BEAB36D
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x842751B9
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x4DF96A62
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x1F852377
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x9B44EEEF
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0xFB163989
the village?"
0xFD345EA0

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x038B56E9

0x3796A4AC
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x750B5D1A
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0x4829F0FB
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x42775539
apply somewhere.  Where?
0xFC980FF8

0x3796A4AC
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x3E407456
wanted?"
0xE285F1D2

0x3796A4AC
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x4B009180

0x3796A4AC
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x8471B0A4
do?"
0x18723783

0x3796A4AC
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x2CE8D3CB
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0xAC79B7F1

0x3796A4AC
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0xF40E44A0

0x3796A4AC
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x40EB753B

0x3796A4AC
"And what do the women do?"
0xFE3EAFAE

0x3796A4AC
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0xB44DEA47
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x91B5D883

0x3796A4AC
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x22E34D46
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xB3A794E9
wanted.  I took leave.
0x446F4AB7

0x3796A4AC
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x7FB87CEF
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0xFCECC39B
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x2E936970
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x5295516F
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0xE5C589BE
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0xDE5F8129
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0x76308098
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x462EEEE5
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x193706E0
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x4AA15B48
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x1E93BE97
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0xBC34901A
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0x14E1D535
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xAB0216CB
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x4BF14D27
if a servant was wanted here?
0x4F9EDCAD

0x3796A4AC
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0xD5D372D6

0x3796A4AC
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0xBED951FB
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0x3FECD225
no matter what."
0x761B2323

0x3796A4AC
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x27A882E5
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x85E16B14
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0xBDEEA6B7
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0x44E575AF
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0xE8547A9F
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0xA77D1258

0x3796A4AC
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x806461B6
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0xB3C77ABC
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x5FC65295
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0x3A745381
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x866B5131
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0x0A895DD7
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0xC457E593

0x3796A4AC
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x7DA77D79
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x2B915FE6
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0x22836213
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x355454B0
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x0D4972EC
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x101BBD54
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0x3C09A256
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xB715CCBA
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xDF1FB92F
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0x2FE088E7
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x57960D6B
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0x472F78DD
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xBDB7F7FD
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0xB5246860
this the parsonage?
0x41C4DF80

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Was the clergyman in?"
0x6FC6D613

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"Would he be in soon?"
0x597E1B0A

0x3796A4AC
"No, he was gone from home."
0xBCF88311

0x3796A4AC
"To a distance?"
0x8EA8751A

0x3796A4AC
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x8F8B136C
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0x6B5FAE35
there a fortnight longer."
0x1EDFE5DE

0x3796A4AC
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x129983A9

0x3796A4AC
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0xC8BBB580
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x782CFB69
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0xC5D15540

0x3796A4AC
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x2479FD60
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0xBFC0436B
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0xDB6327C9
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x2F4F88B6
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0x4424D280
for this handkerchief?"
0xC5D665EB

0x3796A4AC
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0x51E167D9
that way."
0x7DE69132

0x3796A4AC
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x72DC8C43
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x4F38AEC1

0x3796A4AC
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x3755D864

0x3796A4AC
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xCEA6AA98

0x3796A4AC
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x63864E42
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0xF08BF936
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x5AB5053F
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0x6DDA400D
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x2CD745A9
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x8932FB5D
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0x67B3C8C6
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x0B4F0AE8
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x855D9B7F
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xB09129E2
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x7269FAFF
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0xBBB9FCCD
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x9CD05168
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x1900F291

0x3796A4AC
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0x5854331F
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0xDDE56B92
said--
0x873BFE59

0x3796A4AC
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x777FC21F
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x9E03A0FD
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x84132705
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0xC7F61378
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x1BA55E14

0x3796A4AC
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xFBC18BE7
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0xE2B5163B
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x1F30BA2E
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0x7A67896B
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x9525E683
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0x9088AF89
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0x71E68FD9
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0xA1DEEA4F
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x28B7A5E5
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x1818ABC1

0x3796A4AC
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0xF5B0420F

0x3796A4AC
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0x3BC35A26
give her these porridge."
0xFF7C130A

0x3796A4AC
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x18E83F38
pig doesn't want it."
0xA53542C4

0x3796A4AC
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0xD6CCD204
ravenously.
0xCA262844

0x3796A4AC
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x1CE0EF3F
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x3DC04AED

0x3796A4AC
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0xA29FB521
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x1F3500C9
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0xC29806C9
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0xDBA36715
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0x68BFCF97
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xB17F5E94
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0xFB6209C9
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0x84D9BB0F
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x6969E0FA
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0x0A05F9C4
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x8C87AA82

0x3796A4AC
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x82927235
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x962347A6
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x02CA56EB
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x0E963E68
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x594C4C6E
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x7750011C

0x3796A4AC
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x596FA969
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0xC3268F25
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0x3D79DAB5
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x09538DC7
grave."
0x5434FB77

0x3796A4AC
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0x31D7F34A
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x4F22A3A3
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x82F759B2
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x8E85892A
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0xFECC68DD
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xC593A29B
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0xA10F90AD

0x3796A4AC
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xC668D442
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x4280E679
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x84C43004
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x67588F24
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x9D9113DE
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x3C1B6652
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0x5ED17871
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x2095A59A
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x4B5D338E
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0x0ADC2E46
it shut in my face."
0xB23EECF2

0x3796A4AC
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0x79C5E595
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0xED161725
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0xFE6D57F2
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0x1770B74B
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x61A19A7F
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x25A297C5
long.
0xBBEF2AA7

0x3796A4AC
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x6893F996
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0xFA3D74C6
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x143131CF
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0xD2929004
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0x9E690D0E
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0xEB5B844B

0x3796A4AC
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0xC9B3A2D6
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x5C670A81
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x40C53464
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x173884E8
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0x4E4F0F09
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x831A97B3
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x1B9BFA6A
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xF1DD5058
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0xBD28C357
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0xF2F5F17D
sable bush-holly or yew.
0xB2F43891

0x3796A4AC
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0x64A80F79
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x07830488
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x5DF74D8A
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0xE766818C
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x35E88AA4
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x30F4CEA6
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xA941B42E
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0xCDB7BA6A
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0x11EAD3E7
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x0A2DC1A2
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xEFAC6B1D
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0xB08949DE
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0xAC874D1B
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0xB820D790
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0xA11E35E4
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0xEFF3FCA6
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0xB93DB9F8

0x3796A4AC
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0xFB738D9E
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x3618AAC9
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0xC76D0CFC
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0x32C2310D
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x1C1AD057
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x536148D7
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x109E562C
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0x87ED500F

0x3796A4AC
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x13D8C2ED
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0xDA8EAD41
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0x2682D969
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x09D60508
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x6064935C
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x76A6B1E3
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x7A9AE6BE
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xC6C33323
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x28B02BA4
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x46F81C0C
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x2493A8AA
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0x8C619C78
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0xB3DC5C15
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x47735754
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x147B2456
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0xB6508574

0x3796A4AC
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x092865A5
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xFDD915F4
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0xCC8CC34E
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0xDA8DEED3
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0xA2B1ABC2
German I could not tell.
0xBCEBFD4D

0x3796A4AC
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x937AC1DE
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x501E3714
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0xB9AB3C1B
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x3FD0D62C
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x129F723A
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xDFEFA74A

0x3796A4AC
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0xBC3BFC31
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x957269C3
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0xF035FCFD
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x7292FC3D
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x38A8153C

0x3796A4AC
Both were again silent.
0xE0A89CA3

0x3796A4AC
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0x8B442F4F
looking up from her knitting.
0x0E3D7B7E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0x332DD229
other way."
0x4AACB56B

0x3796A4AC
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0xF2A3F9F3
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x388C786C

0x3796A4AC
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0xC05A9F65
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0xDF48C823
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0xCC058214

0x3796A4AC
"And what good does it do you?"
0x78253FA1

0x3796A4AC
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x66D10825
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x746BF975

0x3796A4AC
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0x660004B8

0x3796A4AC
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x0B65AB98

0x3796A4AC
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0x624AAD56
master but a lexicon."
0xEB9B1F4D

0x3796A4AC
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0x70F875FE
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0xC823ABA4

0x3796A4AC
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xC036CC3F
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x393AE7E8
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0x4451CDEF

0x3796A4AC
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0xF7FDD8F3
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xF6332C10

0x3796A4AC
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x6CD89952
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x2D2C13DF

0x3796A4AC
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x0DA69E28
sad now.
0x5FF2AD26

0x3796A4AC
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x827E1F40
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x7BCE6904

0x3796A4AC
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x9D6BD22E

0x3796A4AC
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0x82407205
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x131E1860
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x43E164E7
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0x926BAD92
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x7C1A6E47
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x118B5DC9
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0xC2AABBB5
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0xB8E4C66C
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x0A3C7DE2
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0xDC038550

0x3796A4AC
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0xCE35A787
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x78B89C8E
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0xE90AF900
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0xBF060B96
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xDA298750
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0xC18C2439
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0xDD53CECC

0x3796A4AC
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x9A85274F
St. John when he comes in."
0x56BDC367

0x3796A4AC
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0x46156AF1
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0xB02C0472
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x020D3858
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x2DC0351D
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x26325E03
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0x70798273
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x4149C190
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x91C50A9B
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0xE9BB4038
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x83AE805B

0x3796A4AC
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x907E10CA
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xC946AC7A

0x3796A4AC
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x7AE3549E

0x3796A4AC
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x9931302D
from?"
0xF4719968

0x3796A4AC
"I am a stranger."
0x6D006886

0x3796A4AC
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x2EE76019

0x3796A4AC
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0xB4AF1CA0
bread to eat."
0x1276C082

0x3796A4AC
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0xC8672669
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x4260FCBC
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0xC325504A

0x3796A4AC
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xAC752C97

0x3796A4AC
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0xD323ADAE
now; it looks very ill."
0x9237935E

0x3796A4AC
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x152EC026

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x13FAE0CD
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x60CBB4CB

0x3796A4AC
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x9BA2A7D9
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0xACE446A3

0x3796A4AC
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0xED1CB776

0x3796A4AC
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0xCB8F1AA1

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0xB2B28679
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x335BC333

0x3796A4AC
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0xB458D53E

0x3796A4AC
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0xCDD3F4D5
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0xEFF2C136
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x9276381F
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0x859923ED
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0x139BC429
bolted it within.
0x7C4DB9B6

0x3796A4AC
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x8BF35337
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0x7191D772
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x32A9FA53
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0xEF6929F7
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x9D954DCA
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0xFD0940E3
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x6EBD1FA3
endeavoured to regain.
0x87325FDA

0x3796A4AC
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x746A2FC0
will in silence."
0xDD53D71F

0x3796A4AC
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0x4B3C7FE0
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0x21B9D6CA
and still.
0xFB73F3C3

0x3796A4AC
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x7909C2FA
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0xE9FDE2A1
if you perished here of want."
0x09C13731

0x3796A4AC
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0xDD9F56DF
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x2CBF5B77
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xDE2E021C
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0xEBEF96D6
to the door.
0x87F9597E

0x3796A4AC
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0xDA076580

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x91F15942

0x3796A4AC
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0xA521A9AF
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0xB2C803CA
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x305D9AB3
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x00CAA250

0x3796A4AC
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0xCCF63C69
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x23E49520
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x9AEDC021
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0xE2D6F3BB
house."
0xCB547DFB

0x3796A4AC
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x236DF891

0x3796A4AC
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0x68D1AC82
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x7B2BEA0E
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xBD7586E8
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x1C3AB1E1
me.
0xD35B5291

0x3796A4AC
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0x2BD46A38

0x3796A4AC
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0x211E408E

0x3796A4AC
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0xCA042BE6

0x3796A4AC
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x4C08751D
sit."
0xC04BF0E5

0x3796A4AC
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xD4DA465A
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0xC40BB1E1

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x267FEA7C
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xB2778C89

0x3796A4AC
"A mere spectre!"
0x2C04310A

0x3796A4AC
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x5899D565

0x3796A4AC
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xA2C9A3EB
bread."
0x9C52B12E

0x3796A4AC
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0xCA8C6C95
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x0B4B1AA4
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0xAC81C3AD
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0xEDE85D3F
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xCDC2EDDE

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x93C5AE02
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x305EC833
first, eagerly soon.
0x6507216E

0x3796A4AC
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0x45E9D3C5
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0x2544424B

0x3796A4AC
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x4FA7239D

0x3796A4AC
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x152C9922
name."
0x8248D789

0x3796A4AC
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0xAB3F4B71
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x3104E546

0x3796A4AC
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x35734942

0x3796A4AC
I was silent.
0x0D899212

0x3796A4AC
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x961AB380

0x3796A4AC
I shook my head.
0xAC16E881

0x3796A4AC
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x66550012

0x3796A4AC
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x9CD0487D
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0x80F39DB9
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0x6748F6E3
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0xADFBA14E
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xE7002564
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x176916A8

0x3796A4AC
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x8D11A7D7

0x3796A4AC
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x066CD48A

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x619DDBE1
took the word--
0xBC1D1558

0x3796A4AC
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x67C75421
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0x47ECFF29

0x3796A4AC
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x6B8D4A21
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0xD82F6597
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0xAF977E38
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0xB98C4CA9
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x4FCDBF1B
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0x6EDE4536
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x8DF98CAD
silent.
0x91D7DC60

0x3796A4AC
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0xB253DD05
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0xE964B3BC
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0xCE813001
matter over."
0x774E3D4E

0x3796A4AC
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0x71C37D53
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xB68DDD2C
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0x1B97FE51
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0x5FBD5D0D
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0xEE386775
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0xAB3E99A7
joy--and slept.
0xCF8842A6

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXIX
0xB32F326D

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x0FDE490F
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0xFDD49694
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x616108C2
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xA06883AF
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x088F0B06
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0x85D94811
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x3ABCC201
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x306F93EE
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0xECA081B3
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0xF44DACAC
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x17B7477E
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0xCC3931BA
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0xF48D4942
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xBD91B6E4
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0xB8A727E1

0x3796A4AC
"It is very well we took her in."
0x9119A6C1

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0xB7078B28
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x7C472112

0x3796A4AC
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0xDEF50F1C

0x3796A4AC
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0xB5D8D2EB
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x1D82F090
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x5B6D4330

0x3796A4AC
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0x82687FEC
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x23890143
would be agreeable."
0xD467E2DD

0x3796A4AC
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0x08004A66
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0xD84706F7
myself.  I was comforted.
0x3404E5B0

0x3796A4AC
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0xFE5098BC
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0x91FFA0A5
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x4551DE8D
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xB11E4B81
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0xED0609E0
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x0FEED4CE
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x3ADE0E25
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x38863D6E
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x3AEC6F86
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x71D33BD1

0x3796A4AC
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x10386700
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xE2B157F3
her permanently."
0xA6CF3C45

0x3796A4AC
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x98873B02
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xAD5321BD
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x1B91E352
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x7C793452
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0xA6717CE0
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x9DBA94A4

0x3796A4AC
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x7D8A659D

0x3796A4AC
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0xBB42EE1A
are quite wanting in those features."
0xCB8E9C9B

0x3796A4AC
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0x8EF351C2
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x9E6A1B6C
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0xCF3D538A
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0xF8008407
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x9FDCB927
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0xC4F793D6
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x9814FB83
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0x09075DBF
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x740EE043

0x3796A4AC
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x5304DD66
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xB2F97F66
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xC0F448FA
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0xB3D67D5A
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0xE0E084BC
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0x1506AEB3
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x757BD337
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x444E4465
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x78654460
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x636C2C68
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0x6EA3523D
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x3E85B9FD

0x3796A4AC
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xAE49ECFF
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0xD3A8A520
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x22522373
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x859AEDA1
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x68823FAE
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x6915BA04
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x8396FE7F

0x3796A4AC
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x1FCD929A
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x59C09B7F

0x3796A4AC
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0xA9CC3C3E
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x16499357
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xDF3D685C

0x3796A4AC
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0x355B7599

0x3796A4AC
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0x8F551AAE
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xEDC123E7
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x41252081

0x3796A4AC
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0xA5592AB1
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xFD149B93

0x3796A4AC
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x78EA6245
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x50650F09

0x3796A4AC
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x1B4F6935
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0xE3F5ADAF

0x3796A4AC
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x1759E294

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, very."
0x5F50D8D3

0x3796A4AC
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x2FE194F2

0x3796A4AC
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0xC7C3E40C

0x3796A4AC
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x62FC5463

0x3796A4AC
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0xA8517834
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x9C595E35
basket of the fruit.
0x6E7FA553

0x3796A4AC
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0xE3B92A5E

0x3796A4AC
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x1A763121

0x3796A4AC
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x763AABD7

0x3796A4AC
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x4548BB0D

0x3796A4AC
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x722BBD4D
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x6BBAA2AC

0x3796A4AC
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0xBD95825B
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0xCEB36EF4

0x3796A4AC
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0x315D56FA
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x75F147A5
are."
0xC03C1601

0x3796A4AC
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0xD3476256

0x3796A4AC
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xF16A60C3

0x3796A4AC
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0xD29681B0
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0x91F1145F

0x3796A4AC
"That village a few miles off?
0x87DADCD9

0x3796A4AC
"Aye."
0xD9C33930

0x3796A4AC
"And what is he?"
0x4DDBE7FE

0x3796A4AC
"He is a parson."
0x6B47FF06

0x3796A4AC
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0xCC024E5D
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0xA1C37E70
residence?"
0xECB75125

0x3796A4AC
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0xDF5AD01E
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0xF4F070E5

0x3796A4AC
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0xF1F2930D

0x3796A4AC
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x88647703

0x3796A4AC
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0x81FE82FF

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Their father is dead?"
0x25442255

0x3796A4AC
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0xDF29A841

0x3796A4AC
"They have no mother?"
0x80C5FB56

0x3796A4AC
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x8CC89D88

0x3796A4AC
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x83F3FF88

0x3796A4AC
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0x62AE8E3C

0x3796A4AC
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x4E45BA56
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x229E23B6
beggar."
0x66C48598

0x3796A4AC
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0xE3FB4F9D
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0xA612AFE7
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0xBF847DB6

0x3796A4AC
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x17F31D0B
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x3070085F

0x3796A4AC
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x91AA797F
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x4FD53A21
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0xBA824086

0x3796A4AC
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x0323E8D7

0x3796A4AC
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x1F1F515F

0x3796A4AC
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xDF38A1A2
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0xE0B5068D
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0x8110AC42
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x8511A12E
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0xD5553F54
to consider poverty a crime."
0x843F0F32

0x3796A4AC
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x0F290795
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0x14DC7716
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x9FF12123

0x3796A4AC
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x77E6D3FC

0x3796A4AC
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x3434C639
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x11F76062

0x3796A4AC
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0x7AC29DD3
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x09A6FBE1
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x200961CF
the young people.
0xD17C65B3

0x3796A4AC
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0xFE541CD2
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0xA46C6673
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x3CD10C88
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x4ED0C83A
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x916D0319
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x1659EB66
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x98C88080
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0xFAAA2AE5
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0xC83C1A87
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x9F5A047F
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xF6F2DB0D
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0xCD02D4A4
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x01AAF1A9
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0x8D889630
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xF10DBCC5
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x83BA20A0
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x16B6034F
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0xF347003D
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0x55808F63
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x981920CA
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x2243B598
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x18E404DA
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x846B4759
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xFECE485F
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0xCED394F6
for being united.
0x8C723DF6

0x3796A4AC
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x284385FD
ladies and their brother were now.
0x13317753

0x3796A4AC
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x576BB199
to tea."
0x6EE5D5FC

0x3796A4AC
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0xA0D0422F
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x9B7C73AA
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0xCA461372
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0xB4AC221E
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0xCB2447ED

0x3796A4AC
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0x83D77504
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0xE1B00AB5

0x3796A4AC
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x2E77F6C3
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x763A1A7E
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x3558B3CA
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x8B65BE74
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x5D868DB0
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xBDBE3D2D
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0xCDA74ED8
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x19736FA6
will.
0x68FED328

0x3796A4AC
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0x4627DCA1
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0x94071564
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x230A2F1B
parlour."
0x993B03AA

0x3796A4AC
"I am very well here."
0xE566BA3F

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x73D92CA1

0x3796A4AC
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x8F0A1032

0x3796A4AC
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x38CA8419
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0x1592833D

0x3796A4AC
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x322E5F36
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x26259EC2
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x3DC74B9E
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xBB0FA0D1

0x3796A4AC
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x1E3E5B89
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0xE7CE9201
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x55DC5B1E

0x3796A4AC
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x2F9DC0E0
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x234E8207
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0xCC106C49
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x6432694A
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0xEF6C2025
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x58F7F84F
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x6A946F37
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x38728C72
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x299D272A
and well saved.
0xE4235CE0

0x3796A4AC
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0xCEC75206
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xEFFC0ABF
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0xC7172BD8
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x64EFB187
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x2E9A0D0F
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x90764C4E
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x69ACDE7D
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x14EE4C55
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0xE5CB6CC2
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x4FAB68DB
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0x53B21EC6
fair hair.
0x63C62A14

0x3796A4AC
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0xB80BB876
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x2BD7E5D3
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x90C5C028
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xEC78AAC7
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x21398061
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x9BD158A3
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x8C5C3786
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0x39D2DBB0
of the oven.
0xF5915125

0x3796A4AC
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0xFFAB371D
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0xE15B946A

0x3796A4AC
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x92F2E5BE
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x054F52BA
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x77034DF7
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x5CDE019B
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x0955E55C
from the stranger.
0x244AE7D9

0x3796A4AC
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x99306A65

0x3796A4AC
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xCD0C6877
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x5F015935

0x3796A4AC
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0xB7398541
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x9387E9FE
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x592FD304
immoderately."
0x292C8881

0x3796A4AC
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0xF7ABB719
contrived, unpolished answer.
0xD022BB46

0x3796A4AC
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x04F3557C
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x0A469839

0x3796A4AC
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xE67A3DE4
absolutely without home and friends."
0x30932B0D

0x3796A4AC
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0xAF7E1F3E
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0x66260DB3
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0x22F4D60C
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0xC2930141
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x712C3D3C
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x8CAFDB59
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0xEC875DAB
to encourage.
0x6E0367B0

0x3796A4AC
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xA25E7D62
every connection?"
0x5423B2C8

0x3796A4AC
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0xE0CE090C
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x2B0C6B73

0x3796A4AC
"A most singular position at your age!"
0xF7B68C2D

0x3796A4AC
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x8BE27EED
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0x8F1BED4A
explained the quest.
0x746D03D4

0x3796A4AC
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0xC2F94BE3

0x3796A4AC
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x5E0E1B27
St. John," said she.
0xFE10F50A

0x3796A4AC
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x244E5E1D

0x3796A4AC
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x9E149DFE
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x03EC7297
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0xB7C89F10
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x83316C89
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x26BCFE2B
out tears as well as colour.
0x0B69C294

0x3796A4AC
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x8BC7371B

0x3796A4AC
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x2F1E003C
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x9EB16A41
piercing look.
0x20A14F8F

0x3796A4AC
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x56C20A42
secret," I replied concisely.
0x84AEA261

0x3796A4AC
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0xBD1F5F86
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x358773E6

0x3796A4AC
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xDFDD709B
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x92994141

0x3796A4AC
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x78B6D9CE
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0xE228A1A1
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x4C609D88

0x3796A4AC
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xCEE34BE5
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x583D30E5
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0x43601AA9

0x3796A4AC
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x6327EA75
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0x9C1D4881
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0xD03C2C1B

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0xE2716C63
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0xD126CC76
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x57EE4E3F
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0x03E6B434
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0xC26160B1
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xEEC0CABB
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0x5FE4CE64
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0x93E66F8E

0x3796A4AC
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x42941F35
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0xF119D155
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x84E3BB92
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0xFB09BE72
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x4F39DCA7
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0xB23D2B55

0x3796A4AC
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xBA3F4F4F

0x3796A4AC
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x04B095C6
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x70C544A5
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x242B575C
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x517DD40C
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0x8931B97D
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0xE2AE3A00
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x931DA3AF
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0xF4A290AF
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0xA0A5DDC1
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0xF507187F
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0x8D7ABAE1
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0xE203DD88
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x97FDD4D3
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0xD6954712
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xE20E4FB3
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0xC243036D
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0xD6341ADA
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x6AE1665D
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0xE12E0EC7
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x7E21644C

0x3796A4AC
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xABE1603D
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x27CA31C5
down now, Miss Elliott."
0xBF04A164

0x3796A4AC
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x675D767D
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x54FDA72D
once.
0x297856B3

0x3796A4AC
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0xD90F41C2

0x3796A4AC
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x437D81A2
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xF97EF1CF
sounds strange to me."
0x29706984

0x3796A4AC
"Your real name you will not give?"
0x1EF5905C

0x3796A4AC
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0xB4EC04B4
lead to it, I avoid."
0xF3B7B3DE

0x3796A4AC
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0xE82DB25F
be at peace a while."
0x47BBDD2D

0x3796A4AC
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0xDDDA367A
and with as much acumen as ever.
0xDFB2C85F

0x3796A4AC
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0xC2122FEA
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0xD9DBCD84
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x60760693
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0xB1BFC3B5
us?"
0x488A4E62

0x3796A4AC
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0xC0C5A90D
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x9047CB35
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x5E0DE821
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0xB5271C50

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x87982465
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x6CA0F516
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0xE44E35BA

0x3796A4AC
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0xA2990651
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0xFA398253
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x17554113
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0x416671F6
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0xA358655C
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x86883059
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0xB59B39EC
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x7B31AD91

0x3796A4AC
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0xA01E1089
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x9EC66E63
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0x5D9F993E

0x3796A4AC
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0xB4E07D96
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xE8315421

0x3796A4AC
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x9013B491
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x1FCADE87

0x3796A4AC
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0x23CF74B1
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0xC133C71F
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0x2892C215

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x73BD37C8
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x47C59FD9
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xAC1E6780
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0xA56C79FF
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x8C1AFFCD
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0xBBB0367E
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0xEC33C7FB

0x3796A4AC
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0xD8282236
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x260074D7
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xC001E495
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x2BC55860
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x0EC46E69
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0x65E6B697
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x87C3C5DC
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0xC58E68E6
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0xB315B887
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x2E3943EA
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x431F5CAB
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x05059C7A
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0x6E370F3E
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x3DC0209B
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0xF4FB5557
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x5296826A
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0xC365A030
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0xB5298817
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0xC2D749E2
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0xF7ECDC2C
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0xF31403DD
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0xD576D381
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0xD597AEC7
that entranced theirs.
0xE362E709

0x3796A4AC
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x7019484C
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0x975155F7
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x0A95B29B
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0xF78B71F3
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0xEEF3161B
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xFD272A18

0x3796A4AC
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0xC3C353A6
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x5C2A5BC5
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0x0F22AB9E
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0xA306171B
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x7730AEE2
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0xB655814D
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0xDAE0A8BC
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x8B7D86C8
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0x3EDC26D6
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x2362DFFD
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0xCB57E550
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0xE4052806
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x4A1891CE
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x5CE6D5CB
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xFE852FC0
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0x7E64F7BA
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0xA3F85129

0x3796A4AC
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0xF537F331
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x7035CBAC
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0xA14B5623
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x1BB84CF3
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x0F923F5E

0x3796A4AC
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x19171596
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0xE0B771CC
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x07604D3C
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0x1FB3771B
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x61169436
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x2FA7FDA3
cheerful--
0x2B728AB0

0x3796A4AC
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x55E5550B
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x6BE0F37D
propose to myself?"
0x992A9D38

0x3796A4AC
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0xD470F47A
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0x7B7AAA57

0x3796A4AC
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x32842F70
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x3B965194
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x00452A55
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x0A58725A
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0xE6EDA21F
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x385010F1
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0x7F458CCF
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xF52CA576
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x19DF8BB4
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x14CE8C10

0x3796A4AC
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0x974FCFAF
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x2D098166
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x705040CD
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x6F169E8C
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0xE603DECF
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x67E1B602
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0xE958A34F
delights they could yield.
0x97F4C7F6

0x3796A4AC
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x775B3889
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x9F8A26E6
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xA92664B5
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0xD4E316AE
produced on me.
0x6774EAEF

0x3796A4AC
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x274CB7EF
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x44CC754C
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x93F64B46
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x83A69717
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x510F56DE
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0xBEE6738A
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0xDF891749
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x1FDF3538
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0x4FC9DDE9
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x3BBB9551
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0xF235F62D
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0xFF87F046
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x1BEA6543
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0xB08DFF6D
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xD9C0B7AA
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x6E71DA39
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x2A3C3C7C
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0x295EAB62
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xD631710A
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x873E7392

0x3796A4AC
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x327E0EDE
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x2E117B45
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x60FC4959
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0xA6D425CD
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0xA73D74AA
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x9B9654BF
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0xFF18357F
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x05995B08
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x4F5BD1B9
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xED9C8CC4
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0xD0D812D4
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0xB9C7D0AE
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x2B298E66
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x3EB1FC7D
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x42887717
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0xD8632135

0x3796A4AC
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x22AE905F

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x94B0F253
myself to undertake?"
0x035B5494

0x3796A4AC
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x286F35C7
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x0FD53230
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0x825B430E
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x0976357C
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0xC0535902

0x3796A4AC
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0xEDB20D63

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x5430C14F
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x1D48ADF1

0x3796A4AC
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x91940510
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x733F0988
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x9D30C5A7
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0x04222CBA
interest to me.
0xE8D3DC97

0x3796A4AC
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x77E5B463
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x0A64FF22

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0xE67A8C1B
you to accept."
0x122F2965

0x3796A4AC
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x74C5F57D
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0x5683CD52
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0xCE2DA13D
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x980BEBD3

0x3796A4AC
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0x50635DE0
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x54D19C21
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x36284B4A
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xEE9C0164
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0xA23F4E05
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x7E3DA3D2
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0xCD7314A3
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xAB52F4AE
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x62DD5706
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x3C1DBF28
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0xF8BEFA2F
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x775B6A91
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x11584CE4
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0xD41874DD
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x561F39CF

0x3796A4AC
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x7160F793
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xEEA631A3
glance.  He resumed--
0x61A96830

0x3796A4AC
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x9B1F3F0A
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x269DA170
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x8A3A9C30
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0xFA859060
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0xD06F1B8C
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x34A90EB4
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0xC980DB17
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x665880F2
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x14D7EA34
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xB92F9B39

0x3796A4AC
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0xCE256024

0x3796A4AC
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x99AD7A82
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x11D86BA1
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x967DA8B4
succeeding observations.
0xC3FE7805

0x3796A4AC
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x7A5E579D
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0xE94D5223
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0x25FB48BD
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x837F34AF
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x8AB41D35

0x3796A4AC
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0x2C7EBE84

0x3796A4AC
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x95ABBB0B
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x3825D65B
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x943912B4
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xFC6AABE8
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0xF52177D7
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x1F2E79D6
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0xE8B9662D
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x69C56409
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0x97E3678F
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0xA13DB5A6
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0x6BAD4AD4
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x5D24D979
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x637126A4
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x7DE539C8
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0x4B8396F1
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x2C34B7A6
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0xC6196EEE

0x3796A4AC
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0xA215A80B
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xFAF3299E
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x6B53CF60
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0xE27C2013
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xF91796E2
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0xAF6C372F
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x1B3E6628
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0xCB88B68E
decision.
0xA2E478D7

0x3796A4AC
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0xAD924404
heart."
0x32B07953

0x3796A4AC
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x708BB4BE
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0xA4C6EC59
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0x278EDF19
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x57991A35
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0xE4ECC94A

0x3796A4AC
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x0129D022

0x3796A4AC
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x22D76C52

0x3796A4AC
"I do."
0x3C220A2F

0x3796A4AC
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0x2CED905C
deeply gratified.
0x7F084917

0x3796A4AC
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0x0AE91458

0x3796A4AC
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0xE9EE6558
week."
0xF1F4D9EB

0x3796A4AC
"Very well: so be it."
0x73562262

0x3796A4AC
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x31431D4A
me.  He shook his head.
0x325BE28A

0x3796A4AC
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x0D004896

0x3796A4AC
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0x208CF87A

0x3796A4AC
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x4417745E

0x3796A4AC
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x5D7B9F9A
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x8B63EAF2

0x3796A4AC
"I am not ambitious."
0x4CE23B28

0x3796A4AC
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x22F1C22E
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x1A59CC60
it out?"
0x05CB98F0

0x3796A4AC
"I was speaking of myself."
0xEABC646A

0x3796A4AC
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x8744F1FD

0x3796A4AC
"What?"
0x7B236543

0x3796A4AC
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x5702B766
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xED271617
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0xC2C2D20E
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x10D4DEC3
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x7F255B2B
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0xF7A133D4
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x8337E7FC
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x0D86FD9B
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xF2BAED26
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0x5244D669
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xCE9687ED
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xDF5E82DC
some means."
0x29C4662C

0x3796A4AC
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0xDDAE19ED
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0xBB888A81

0x3796A4AC
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x89B409B1
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x814C4F43
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x273B6D7A
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x868C49A2
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x9DA10F09
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0x27D42D88
parting for life.
0x5EFB754F

0x3796A4AC
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0xCC59DE4E
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0xAC3F119F
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xD16901D0
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0xC65D893B
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x9219E9D3
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x9B88D96C
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x237E497C
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0x8D8FCDD0

0x3796A4AC
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0x4D5CBB2D
she murmured.
0xCA70276E

0x3796A4AC
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0xC0A2A9F6
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x48C28AA5
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0xF8EBE6EB
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x61AB37DB
letter.  He entered.
0x4C2E8D1A

0x3796A4AC
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0xA0CBD178

0x3796A4AC
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x66228141
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0xAB1C0AC8

0x3796A4AC
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x17C36874

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0x18858A79
demanded, in a low voice.
0xCC4973BE

0x3796A4AC
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x99C655F9
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0x0E85807B

0x3796A4AC
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x3A858A8E
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xFCE52161
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0xC95C4472
enough.
0x973D29C9

0x3796A4AC
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x99BFA420

0x3796A4AC
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x031A4FCE
Mary.
0x3AB4BCFF

0x3796A4AC
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x78D1EC30
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x06B542EC
what _is_."
0x1446A0DB

0x3796A4AC
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x2BDD9003

0x3796A4AC
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0xD43A8DB2

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0xA18729AA
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x917574A0
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0xA98B3827
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x4DF3F1F0
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x12F011A6
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xD8FC1FC6
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x0B136937
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x719DD0D8
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xBEECDF97
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0xDCF76ACA
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0xD9BE3365
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x7BB3300F
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0xA9C5188B
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0xA10A2526
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x830C2302
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x4684A10D
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x821DE07B
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x0370C35F
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0xE26043EA

0x3796A4AC
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x82A43606
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xA2892158
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xFDD47F47
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x3E3951D3
and so the old grange was abandoned.

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXXI
0x1965A511

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x4A6FAF0D
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x8A5FF41A
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x1F5CA08E
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x4027883C
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x5071AFF3
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x108BCCBA
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x7B33BF2B
things as are necessary.
0xFE02CA9F

0x3796A4AC
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x6717687D
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x26786C41
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0xDA04FACD
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x0FB2AA2B
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x3583C827
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x10E88D65
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xD3EC02A4
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x1E0F7FF9
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0x15DE1651
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x9872FC3B
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0x40B783CC
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x7C1E1680
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x5EB3AD48
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0x6B254685
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0x17421038
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x103FB4DA
on from day to day.
0xFBB6BBC3

0x3796A4AC
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xDFC7B3B1
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0xEC7353B9
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0xA52F1072
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0xC07466F8
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0xE528FA53
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0xDA5BDAE2
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0xA5FD8DBB
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x8E6DEA50
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x1EDAE9C8
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x5672CBBE
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0x39C09FE6
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0x12DFFFFF
gratification for disgust.
0xF633CDC8

0x3796A4AC
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0x8D9C939C
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0x57098EDB
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x4D112577
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x303E0A51
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x1F4D8FE8
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xE8579585
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x56F8CF53
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x2E5C3481
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0xA6E77798
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0xF4113DD8
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x73293A41
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0xCD19A77B
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0x22A013CB
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0x26F03169
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x23E4CE11
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0xDC82BE0B

0x3796A4AC
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x3005DD71
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0x04DBE9D4
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x32A19159

0x3796A4AC
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0xEDDE299E
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0x2C677ACA
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x8895A89F
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0xDE0A4303

0x3796A4AC
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0xB52BFA7D

0x3796A4AC
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x40FC18E8
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0xD7C94A7E
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xDE8EB4D6
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0xADCD09DD
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0xEFA514A3
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x2146E10C
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0xA3A4A664
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0x85B1425F
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x0F723A25
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x5D9FD6A2
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0xCEBDD90C
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x7F3E91F6
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0xDFB7223F
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x8D5C98C3
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x2847E6A7
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x35E5B4FE

0x3796A4AC
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0xD043011B
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0xA06CC573

0x3796A4AC
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0xFD3A9BA0
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x318AE611
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x24F451F5

0x3796A4AC
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x26BD210F
asked.
0xA5BD5458

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0x3F7ADAB0
scholars very well."
0x5E7E0A5D

0x3796A4AC
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x0DF71CEB
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0xE57DB408
I interrupted--
0x996957DB

0x3796A4AC
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x451909FE
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0xAE89D333
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x036F70AB
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0xB18EBA24
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0xE034A79F
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x32FCD0F2
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0xAD420673

0x3796A4AC
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x659804BF
is dark and empty."
0x4157A588

0x3796A4AC
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x953C376D
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0xE0969013

0x3796A4AC
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x4774A695
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x7D4B1E20
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0xCD2AC8D2
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x77AEEDD5
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x922FC693
steadily, for some months at least."
0xE15AB2A3

0x3796A4AC
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x3B1C7E6B

0x3796A4AC
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0xCAE43EB3
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xA6AC3AB8
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x015D7761
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0x482F97D9
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0xF0F519ED
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xA4A3C622
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x0E83488B
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x05D7BFED
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x7C538CBB
rougher than it.
0x20C2F0E9

0x3796A4AC
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0xC3B41AD0
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0x87E085EC
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x629A17E4
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x1EBCF258
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0xA262A0DD
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x4F47B699
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0x63FA3F81
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x7471A779
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x366B250C
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x917AD64C
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xDE10E2B0
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0x074AEE38
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x23F64527
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x1908A798
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x8ED033E7

0x3796A4AC
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x7474C168
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0xA09A8BF8
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x7AC1CAAA
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0xA0A8EB3D
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x9AB53B1B
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x8496141A
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0xD605F841
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0xEC6171D4
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x7B4B6B22

0x3796A4AC
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0xDB5A256A
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0xC53C971A
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x146ED25D
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0xAB2C3D88
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0x59C910A0
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x78CEF42B
exclaimed--
0xEF2FE2C9

0x3796A4AC
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0xCFD15555
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x21911558
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0x58BEFA12
your back towards me now."
0xC8806E75

0x3796A4AC
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0xD2539636
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0x9C1C359D
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x9FD8AA28
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x5E8B21BD
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x3ECCC8C1
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0xCBF61DCA
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x955E9B7B
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x9F56858E
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x1AFF256A
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x3F5B7006
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0xDB5931D1
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0x38BE96AF
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0xD8D749A8
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0x7535E73A
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x9B9ECF41
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x7CE7BC4E
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x988CA432
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x223A27B0
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0xE1952DEC
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x051BF938
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x3349F646
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x99237725
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0xE2E907A5
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0xDCD707E2
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x9B7F9D15
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x7A9EC538
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xB6A4CC1E

0x3796A4AC
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0xA2686D7F
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x77822682
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0xA3290DC2
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x5FDBA903
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x13E7616C

0x3796A4AC
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x73445560
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0xC8E4E78C

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xA1FA93B4
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x059335A6
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x380EF61E
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0xE400CB8A
pointing to me.
0xFB1F3D15

0x3796A4AC
"It is," said St. John.
0xE6C8993E

0x3796A4AC
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x30353000
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x752761EC

0x3796A4AC
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0x0A29F23F

0x3796A4AC
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0x1526690C

0x3796A4AC
"Quite."
0x34B014DE

0x3796A4AC
"Do you like your house?"
0x58B2D2EF

0x3796A4AC
"Very much."
0xB67BB1C9

0x3796A4AC
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0x0E81977C

0x3796A4AC
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x557C0674

0x3796A4AC
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x455F70D2

0x3796A4AC
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x435A776F
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x06745707
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x493C83CA
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0xF486285D

0x3796A4AC
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xFC0E68A0
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0xD6E116AC
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x176BA644
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x294467B8
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0x84168C87
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0xC2BCDB4A
merchants to shame."
0x9B31BAFC

0x3796A4AC
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x493D2A79
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x35586750
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0x4344DD2A
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xCF9F887B
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x01585A0D
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x4A4F8BF6
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0xA1CEF113

0x3796A4AC
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x5330ADAE
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0xFE7B8A77
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0x6A521137

0x3796A4AC
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x9B77CA36
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x3FBC5DF6
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xD88F9410
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0x2A72C42B
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x114790D1
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0xBE60693B
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0xACD46DD4
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0x988AB734
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x5C651930

0x3796A4AC
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0xD03BE7D8
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x64B040CC
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x43D91A8D

0x3796A4AC
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x35BD8C79
John.
0x46C69199

0x3796A4AC
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x1F4D0AFD
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x6576B3BA
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0xE99B74B3
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0x1DED7508
her own.
0x6FA06C4D

0x3796A4AC
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0x5FD60356
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0xBA0AA3FC
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0xC892266A
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0xBD08853D
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x2CF780C7
papa."
0xED2FD1CD

0x3796A4AC
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x1E5FD796

0x3796A4AC
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x4A2543C0
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x1D7EE576

0x3796A4AC
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0xA45FDA53
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0xC0B0B77C

0x3796A4AC
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0xD7A5C986
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0xC856E444
returned.
0xCF8D2EF4

0x3796A4AC
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x00F447C7
blanched as her gown.
0x2CF0C38D

0x3796A4AC
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x5CAEA1E8
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x0686E637
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x5B88039E
at all.
0x58A554BB

0x3796A4AC
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x612BD282
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0xD5E51BA7
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xAB0B201C

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0xF5971108
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x1AD09F89
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0x481B6DD0
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xF0D9CF6A
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x42DCA13D
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x7D4D3DE5
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0x7CF10CE6
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0xFBEA6983
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x0512859F
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0xF1366CE4
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x6365BB1D
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x54549807
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0xEFA6C610
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x719E439A
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xC935C3CB
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x7ADA016F
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x371570D6
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x064464DA
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x31BAFA0A
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x18DC9209
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x21972B7D
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x90EFDDB7
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x9DD39BDA
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x5B702174
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0x9A18B1C9
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xB224ECE0
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x26B750DB
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xA0592C12
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0x50DEF568
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x8C6C4D1E

0x3796A4AC
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0xCF9BF554
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x946546A2
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0xEE730725
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x9D3750E3
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0xCA88C81A
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0xBB54A84A
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0x0E0A29CE
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x78507B0E
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x50F882A6
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0xF2229319
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x349A18E7
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x69E523DD
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x5655D60D
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x3CC9FA44
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x0E9E5540
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x278E3D18
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0xFFF3FC24
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x978EBDD5
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x2E27A2EF
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0x6D5EF0B7
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0xD6F1FAC1
duties of the day.
0x0A1656CB

0x3796A4AC
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0x4C01AF25
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0xA321B536
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x2C48842B
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x98F11FFB
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x5FCF2717
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0x95113AFC
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x7CE04D05
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0xA1941D10
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x75C4E6F6
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0x25FD2841
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0xCF737EBF
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x12E5371B
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x0AEC52FF
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x0751C3A2
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x8D442F1E
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x69E31ACD

0x3796A4AC
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0xCC709C70
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x525D6095
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x894C4091
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0xB563ADD9
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x9B838680
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x13FC7982
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x414F67F4
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0x3DD5BF5B
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0xC80713B8

0x3796A4AC
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x27BE1862
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0x755738CA
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x195545F5
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xA257D588
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0x3D6B0B9B
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xF02585C5
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x1E66BE58
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x2339BDEA
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x7BFD1512
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0xE5C1E3F7
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0xB4DDE517
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0x0509C6B5

0x3796A4AC
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0xCCC7081E
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x3B7407B7
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0x26573CC1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xC3FA0E38
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0xFE2FBA0C
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x91CAD91B
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xC702D6A2
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x7F698274
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x448C6C88
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0xF81B3D94
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0xD21DAD98
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0x26129333
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x3AA6161B
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0xF580E743
acquaintance.
0x43DE377E

0x3796A4AC
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x4E46C780
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0xD4681781
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x8CE3BB19
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0xB3F1D0B4
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x7C8EA118
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xBC5F921B

0x3796A4AC
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x240F0D08
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x29678872
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0xEDBBAF19
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0xE0768D90
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0xD41FBD1C
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x4E9AFD6E
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x765ADE8F
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0xD2804745

0x3796A4AC
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0xBFC76832
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x78B1907E
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x89471CE1

0x3796A4AC
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0xB393E7FD
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0x6106D429
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0xE9BA886C
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x2BF32E09
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x09B455E9
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0xA3E246DE
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x10C9601B
day.
0x34A2CB3C

0x3796A4AC
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0x3C1FABE9
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xE97A4D3E
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0x035701D8
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x371D3DE8
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x2FB99EB1
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x4E86579D
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x2A8CC381
Hall.
0xC2C9044F

0x3796A4AC
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0xA88F294C
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x0556CFF6
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0xCD0A481B
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0xC13B68B1
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0xEE6AC2A2
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x80C87405
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x58902036

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xA3E1E15D
high family, papa."
0xD9E76751

0x3796A4AC
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x222B4048
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0x52802EA9
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0xB8EB8CEB
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0x445457EA
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0x86F4D286
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x05685C55
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xD960D951
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0xB9C859E2
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0xDE50CF2C
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0xDE1050D3
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x28D4BCEA
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xC3B87DF9

0x3796A4AC
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0x5241C536
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0xE3B43D88
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x181B2931
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x4C2CA77E
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x9E6BFE1D

0x3796A4AC
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x98CB83EA
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x2487E5BC
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0xEF7B0B58
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x7FFF26A8
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x0AB2C325
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x84F0A12D
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0x169880D0
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0xF2C35378
Rivers.
0x12DA1740

0x3796A4AC
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0xBDF7586A
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x80ED9152
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0x70C5C3E3
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xCC87ED71
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x18FD8047
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x7C2B3D37
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x66EBDA0F
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x027F5B30
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xBACEC317
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0xE5CC4346
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x5CD1E7EA
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x90708F79
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x416F11C0
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0xA8FA4A71
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0x2B5D23ED
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0xCC29D457

0x3796A4AC
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x99CA99F5
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x67BA3660
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0x2F6FECB6
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x6793037E
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x66995EE2
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xC8CA638C
him some good, if I could.
0xEEA7398F

0x3796A4AC
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xEB71DCCA
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0xB1174F77
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0xF18BFBF1
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x1DA6D110
him talk."
0x1329A235

0x3796A4AC
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x97799340
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0xA6187798
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0xE7992643
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x9A1438F2
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x955266CB
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x91B0CAFE

0x3796A4AC
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0xBE86EB34

0x3796A4AC
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xFB4988A5

0x3796A4AC
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x8075C42F

0x3796A4AC
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x65E527ED
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0x360E8B8D
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0x1A95B83B
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x874C4192
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xB8E0D728
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xF986952A

0x3796A4AC
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x3B18C6A6
graceful and correct drawing."
0x7E3BD216

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x9580C172
like?"
0xE8D38D6C

0x3796A4AC
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0xA92DB393

0x3796A4AC
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x83CE72DA
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0xB695012E
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x80E7D907
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0xCEA26B24
deem worthless."
0x2E21D54A

0x3796A4AC
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0x7E6A19C8
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x65663061
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0xC31CD128
smiles!"
0x2E8D864D

0x3796A4AC
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x943F78E7
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xC741334A
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0xB9C9FE1D
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x1ECD988B

0x3796A4AC
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0x40A02B31
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x9413AD94

0x3796A4AC
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0xCE5A1F04
or wise is another question."
0x29B03F94

0x3796A4AC
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0xCCEFA269
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0x75CCF282
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x38D22DF6
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x66D4504E
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xCB2D2695
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0xAADE67D3
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0xEF8735D6

0x3796A4AC
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0xA9872EDA
take to yourself the original at once."
0x66DAAF62

0x3796A4AC
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x5614E794
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x7949F46F
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x8E7DDB49
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x61AE6F25
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0x4A8EC21D
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0xE40A0084
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0xB44D89FF
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x67BD596D
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0xF35DB174
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0xB855151D

0x3796A4AC
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x50BD7BA3
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xB276EBDF
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0xABC8132B
ought to marry her."
0x032076B1

0x3796A4AC
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x0D82F75B

0x3796A4AC
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x74F9C806
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0xD712C311
often."
0x893C6E1B

0x3796A4AC
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0xF5899738
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xE0223DA9
the table to measure the time.
0x7DFE9A5C

0x3796A4AC
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x0E75E09A
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x8E18F097
fetter your heart?"
0xE662589D

0x3796A4AC
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0xFF368712
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x366E7B28
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x01E1BB09
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0xC52CCD60
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0xF8EA9B3E
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x73A47BB1
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0xA370CFBF
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x8FA22325
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x33527590
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0xE316A3D4
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0xACBFA373
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x0D262A75
time I marked pass in peace."
0x40DC7A46

0x3796A4AC
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x0BA91AD9
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xDF58D0D2
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0xEE3F9BBC

0x3796A4AC
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0x4ED0BEA4
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x6DAFBA29
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x8E1DA00A
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x189905C1
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x360391C8

0x3796A4AC
I gazed at him in wonder.
0xE763A4F0

0x3796A4AC
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x6C00BCB0
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0xAFB24FEB
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0xC0D8C351
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x83CC39E3
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x13A63E30
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0xCEB5E245
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x2E695273

0x3796A4AC
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0x8DCB0B38

0x3796A4AC
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x34705086
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x8DFD7AD4
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0x5EFD9583
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x482EAC15
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x334FADFF

0x3796A4AC
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0x1E8662C1

0x3796A4AC
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0xEE673398
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0x90549E69
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x01617D3F
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xC1861A44
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x99E3E388
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0xA9DC544B
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0x4F5A5CD0
live for."
0xF45A2A32

0x3796A4AC
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x74F5185B
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x0BE5B084

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0xED1CC0C6
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0xBAF1F28E
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0xEB81B121
should do."
0x0A90EE48

0x3796A4AC
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0x5B778D2B
wasting away."
0x609A93B1

0x3796A4AC
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x7D0DD57F
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x1B7A0C03
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0xB73001EF
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0x402A16BC
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0xBB97B72D

0x3796A4AC
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x30E1B0B3
schoolroom."
0xDD80661C

0x3796A4AC
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0xED16B8A9
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0xE1CD358C
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x4929A4A5
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0xFF7B38A8
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0xE61EB412
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x8EA97F6E

0x3796A4AC
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0xCF652CF4
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0xF52C7925
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xCA1ACF38
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x33C6D0C6
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x41049572
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x095B02C2
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x1AA78ED5
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0xD3559E7C
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x02CF948A

0x3796A4AC
I smiled incredulously.
0x48CEEBC1

0x3796A4AC
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0xC24A66DE
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x4AA8AE2A
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x97D9A8BC
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0xC3D52865
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x6C6042BA
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0x8CA54558
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0xDFDB4CA7
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0x93D83E76
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x7211185E
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x8ED623D2
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0xDA38D81C
still suffer."
0xC67AF2D4

0x3796A4AC
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x5792957F

0x3796A4AC
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x1E024E94
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x0866EF27
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0x6BD72465
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x1BCA48C8
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x5BDDEB21
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x2CBA81AE
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x76416A9C
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xEE689306
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x8F60E43F
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x73FCB0E8
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x8D5C3D8B
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0xC6C05871
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x33871C95
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0xE56D381F

0x3796A4AC
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0x0C3AF657
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0xEED8AC34

0x3796A4AC
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x976A2915
World, indeed!"
0x1155096A

0x3796A4AC
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x4612FDA9

0x3796A4AC
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x820E3385

0x3796A4AC
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x49A23693
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0xEE9F9887
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0xC4D9F564
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x36689493
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0xD5C9E335
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x12DBA55B
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x4E43EBBD
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0x9DE9DAF1
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x3A818859

0x3796A4AC
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x9816B984

0x3796A4AC
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x8A2C94A0
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x7397781C
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0xE2C9DE0D

0x3796A4AC
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0x35E2EA5A
globe, however!"
0x732FC114

0x3796A4AC
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0xD7B7FF59
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0xA3D328BD
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x38B053D1
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x145508C0
forgot it.
0xC6D59D71

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXXIII
0xCB58C025

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x0526AC8F
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x90EDD2CC
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x0A4C2CF8
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x22C681EC
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0xA0A59546
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0x7151B24B
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0xF3A4958B

0x3796A4AC
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0x9E775C24
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x65C5E8A3
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x4954525B
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xE970A2B1
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0xAFFA6CF0
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0xFBC3B9AF

0x3796A4AC
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x81D71C04

0x3796A4AC
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0xE1FB4899
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0x3415C14A
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0x8CA985B4
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0xBB540606
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0xAA442AAB
vale that night.
0x350EF757

0x3796A4AC
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x59485F1C

0x3796A4AC
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0x9424D9A0
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x94981DC2
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xADAB1DBE
boots.
0xF79D45DB

0x3796A4AC
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x568E29AD
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x1043839E
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0x9D3626D9
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xBED28E02

0x3796A4AC
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x9A08CF2A

0x3796A4AC
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0xF756CFE2
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x6E930C16
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x663D52C8
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x3146D552
impatient to hear the sequel."
0xD63CB60C

0x3796A4AC
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x7C4EBBA6
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x584E8883
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0xBD66281F
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x8B4F3043
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0xD2FDBFC7
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0xF0A88841
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0xB2ABF268
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xF477B8C3
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x9F4517A1
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0x4FC1B70A
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x24495CBE

0x3796A4AC
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x748C7095
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0x5EA9CAE6
health."
0x2B5CB702

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x42277737
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x1E516655

0x3796A4AC
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xD55A34E1
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x45521C4C
silenced.
0x073C024A

0x3796A4AC
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x3856521F
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x8BDFA1BE
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x3A92E3A1
was behind him.
0xF9F37AD6

0x3796A4AC
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0x38CF2E76

0x3796A4AC
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0xF31620B9
alone now, and return to my book."
0xFD3D0B21

0x3796A4AC
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0xA0FC0A26
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x813FE96A
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x6D7575EA
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x58B97E8F
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x9EEF1421
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x47B4E269
I would.
0xF56F09FD

0x3796A4AC
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x2D23C895

0x3796A4AC
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0x9A82CEB4

0x3796A4AC
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xF0A31B65
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xEA0CD352

0x3796A4AC
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x3D64A697
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x60518963
and my scholars.
0xE0F24F16

0x3796A4AC
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x7A399A79
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x66C303C7
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x4B2D2D59

0x3796A4AC
"Indeed!"
0x1BFDF979

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x1D6E8B82

0x3796A4AC
"Does he?"
0x2A06A6CC

0x3796A4AC
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x9AFB6BE4

0x3796A4AC
"I know."
0xB650E820

0x3796A4AC
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x24F0B980

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"Whose, then?"
0xECC426D1

0x3796A4AC
"His daughter's, I think."
0xFCDB4DF8

0x3796A4AC
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x340BD32A

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x179445A5
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x514B40C1

0x3796A4AC
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0x931E2B98

0x3796A4AC
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0x6D37DB5B

0x3796A4AC
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0xF284FCEB
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x5EE9270F
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0x8152D19E
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x04C64B7A
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x9360A71E
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x3D6131C0
trite or novel, it is short.
0x1770C749

0x3796A4AC
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x80DF4EE9
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x95BD7C31
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x08AF8D6A
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0xAA197762
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x99DBBBCE
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0x8920DCA2
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0x6FB55B54
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0x04C9D944
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0x687C654A
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0x4D9667D4
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xD86F4F01
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x2AC23328
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xAFEDEF14
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0x865FCF28
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0xA99F71FF
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x136060C4
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x57EC62CB
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x54E94329
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x8A4CE3AD
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x8B6826DB
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x22F7967B
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x04F02C15
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0xA5C01450
Rochester."
0x1494D2C4

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x88ED9194

0x3796A4AC
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0x4272D21C
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0xE2D06534
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xFB397B45
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x34FBE3E3
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0x63BA3E06
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x138CDF75
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xA253A0ED
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0xA537EACA
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x70CA8DEC
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x7C018A67
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0xCB1CAB19
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x452CDE08
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0xC96E3EA9
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0xC64648B3
odd tale?"
0x4BDCBB1F

0x3796A4AC
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x8E0A6765
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x9FF92BBB
doing?  Is he well?"
0xF2E0F8C6

0x3796A4AC
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0x08B8CE71
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x1981B492
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xCF606FA1
which requires her appearance."
0x05A767F0

0x3796A4AC
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0x0045BA74

0x3796A4AC
"I suppose not."
0x4295065E

0x3796A4AC
"But they wrote to him?"
0x6DEF54DD

0x3796A4AC
"Of course."
0x23304BDF

0x3796A4AC
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x9C066308

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0xD883685F
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0xAFF4691D

0x3796A4AC
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0xF624A7CF
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xB1DFCC35
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x9F50B3B0
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0xADC314F5
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0xF1BFFC5B
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0x38760A73

0x3796A4AC
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x6B224DAA

0x3796A4AC
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0xB2BA18FE
warmth.
0x8B74BEE8

0x3796A4AC
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0xBD00EEDD
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x7F1F6BDA
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x0EE31BE1
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x9C8A8D8B
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xCFC0C848

0x3796A4AC
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0xCD1DDA1F
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0x92B98A0F
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x5194D225
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x6EE27F06
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x108697D9
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0xE82A6776
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0x9EDCDEF9

0x3796A4AC
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0xC8484756
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xE03A38D2
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0xF7069639
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x1AEACE62

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x26DC3846
Rochester than you do."
0xCBFFE271

0x3796A4AC
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0x52E28021
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x0E66657D
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x6FE9974B
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x15AC895D

0x3796A4AC
"Well, what did he want?"
0xB6024C73

0x3796A4AC
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0xBC411C36
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0x568D0C72
that--nothing more."
0xF653A911

0x3796A4AC
"I!--rich?"
0xCFB922FF

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0xF2489787

0x3796A4AC
Silence succeeded.
0x5DE838ED

0x3796A4AC
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x4EED0918
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0xD0E89FFB
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x56DB2AE6
will and the necessary documents."
0x9F74DFBF

0x3796A4AC
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0xEB224F8D
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0xE52D32A0
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x36E85530
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0xD7744E1C
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0x9B65B39B
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x6E7972FC
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x626A205A
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0x502AC792
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x5108C9B2
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x7A2A2936

0x3796A4AC
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x5AEC628A
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0x350873E4
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x61FF28E4
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0xAB39137C
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0x8452D93A
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0xD857D3CE
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0xC34297E0

0x3796A4AC
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0xEB5E8CFC
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0xD30A4BF1
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x7B09D58C

0x3796A4AC
"How much am I worth?"
0xEB30DC12

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0xFE9EA33A
think they say--but what is that?"
0xD0399117

0x3796A4AC
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x9E91E1BB

0x3796A4AC
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0xAB68BF67
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0xC0581E58
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0x5DFC9C6F

0x3796A4AC
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0xB3D5F091
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xC0CA7155

0x3796A4AC
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0x6833634C

0x3796A4AC
"No mistake at all."
0x70784915

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0xA393C49D

0x3796A4AC
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x1F40D7FD

0x3796A4AC
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0xBB94665C
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x57E00175
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x62F22153

0x3796A4AC
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0xD5C7AE11
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xA7F082E9
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x869938D0
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0xBE739D8E
Good-night."
0x94695987

0x3796A4AC
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0xD3F50DF7
minute!" I cried.
0xA5CB973C

0x3796A4AC
"Well?"
0x855F2AAE

0x3796A4AC
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x02E0767B
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0xC8A97313
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0x7E4B1D1F

0x3796A4AC
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xEECB5060
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0x4480D4BF

0x3796A4AC
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x886535DB
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0xF20CB4EA
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0x6FE60681

0x3796A4AC
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0xB4F5744E
about it."
0xAF49F819

0x3796A4AC
"Another time."
0x186DAC5D

0x3796A4AC
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0xB156614A
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x9C783CE2

0x3796A4AC
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0x4FB38234

0x3796A4AC
"I would rather not just now."
0xF5497721

0x3796A4AC
"You shall!--you must!"
0x0B1FFF77

0x3796A4AC
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0x0EAF91E1

0x3796A4AC
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x3C2F11A3
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0xF23C928A

0x3796A4AC
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0x9AEC37F7
persuade."
0x534B1B0D

0x3796A4AC
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0x50E2A5FC

0x3796A4AC
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0xD3D8C072

0x3796A4AC
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0xC777E0CD

0x3796A4AC
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x32EB3EC0
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0x3B36120B
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0x6225F05F
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0x5F6B6B32
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0x58FE01EC

0x3796A4AC
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0x123E2E9D
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0xBD36840D
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x7FDF6A9F

0x3796A4AC
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0xF30E6C52

0x3796A4AC
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xF7EAEFC5
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0xE046E04E

0x3796A4AC
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0x22947699
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x763740D9
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0x9CE6D764

0x3796A4AC
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0xFD49E259
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0xFCC80CC7
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x2E0ED5B5
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0xF1E84FC3
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0xC6AF9637
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xBC75B0F3
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x9CEF081B
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x80487DB3
explanation.
0x26A28056

0x3796A4AC
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0xA2C7B277
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x7956F4EB
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x98E408AE
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x1BFFEBD0
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x734E6A58
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x5194092C
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x9D6DC9E1
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x2F206AFB
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0xE2BFC33D
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x51947992
against the door.
0x7D0308C6

0x3796A4AC
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xCB71C92C
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0x49812C39
enough.  I resumed--
0x9D9A5C2B

0x3796A4AC
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x263F6C9E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"My aunt, consequently?"
0xCC61EDEE

0x3796A4AC
He bowed.
0x405A6A4A

0x3796A4AC
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0x89640B46
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0xBF6AFA20

0x3796A4AC
"Undeniably."
0x21478825

0x3796A4AC
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0xF6D9EF89
the same source?"
0xF37DE2DE

0x3796A4AC
"We are cousins; yes."
0x07ECFFB8

0x3796A4AC
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0x807E358C
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0x34A62E3A
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0xD1F96FD5
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0x58D3F9D9
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0xA7DAABD7
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x3DADFD68
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0x4BD5334C
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0xAB2F5CA5
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0x57EF48AE
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x26088805
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x2E36D593
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x84EE0FE5
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0x94B990BC

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x2CC9BD06

0x3796A4AC
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0xC9433B95
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x877680B1
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x9DAF47F2

0x3796A4AC
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x0BF04A1B
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0xCF784238
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0xAA6AB9F4
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0x3AD7396F

0x3796A4AC
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0xF7D5F74E
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x69DAFEE1
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x27B824CB
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x14E21C82
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0xF19E8354
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x36E0B138
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x63A0674C
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xE238BF1C
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xB81A2C3C
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xF15C845F
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x6F5BC508
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0xB5D07ABF
enjoyment.
0x0705C9D1

0x3796A4AC
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x23036DA6
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x15D60BB9
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0xE653C102
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0xA51373F2
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0xDF62AA2A

0x3796A4AC
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0x1A36D822
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0xC21A2A0C
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0x847FEBA9

0x3796A4AC
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0xFC0A0BAC
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0x991D7E4D

0x3796A4AC
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x21E68090
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x1AFFDF61
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x8F168082

0x3796A4AC
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x78C3DF45
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0xD8C9D6B3

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0x6B28F527
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0x55D5AE8F

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0x34D80F76
comprehend better."
0x0170AC54

0x3796A4AC
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0x47EE150A
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x5596159E
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0xE8569FF1
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0xD4122936
fortune that has accrued to them."
0x3D8CDC20

0x3796A4AC
"To you, you mean."
0x91C0E056

0x3796A4AC
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0xA47978DB
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0xFE1BEF4B
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0xD1B2410A
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x6C160558
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0xDB5EC5A1
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0xDAA3171D
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x44617DBE
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0x4AC06032
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0xC3BEC2C4
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0x3DAE1DEB

0x3796A4AC
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x9B81D808
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0xE2B57773

0x3796A4AC
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0x0CC2D89E
the case?"
0x5CC890CE

0x3796A4AC
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0x3CCF7764
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0x420F422B
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x780816CB
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0x10F71BC5
consider it absolutely your own."
0x4D79775A

0x3796A4AC
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0x8E692155
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xB0B90870
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0x789ADBAE
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x9BAF690A
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0x47B3594B
myself lifelong friends."
0x0534D354

0x3796A4AC
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xE453425D
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0xB3F4D02C
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0xCF4C62CA
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0xEE01B8E2
you: you cannot--"
0x5F893D19

0x3796A4AC
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0xFE5B636A
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x313A6462
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x97B1956E
and own me, are you?"
0xBA53A6C2

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x4C8ADE8C
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0xB92F96C7

0x3796A4AC
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x82D63077
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x46B47E5E
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0x62716945
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x531BDCE7

0x3796A4AC
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x7D46C04D
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x5ABB58F9

0x3796A4AC
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x244D7CC7

0x3796A4AC
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0xD4004432
excitement under which you labour."
0xA2B3294C

0x3796A4AC
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0x77DE51E0
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x8122585F
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0x952C85BF
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x5158267A
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0x17193B9E
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0xC02681FC
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0x2B2E9B65

0x3796A4AC
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0x89FEE8C4
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0xDBC1219A
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xF618E6BC
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x709B0D47
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xF17C3985
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x879D8099
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0x859AF74F

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0xD59A7DDD
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0xB18DB8D8
scruple."
0x04F92FC4

0x3796A4AC
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x6774A2F7

0x3796A4AC
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x7D2DE525

0x3796A4AC
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0xF4DDE904

0x3796A4AC
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x68CE4974
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x7ED6F693
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x55A0F717
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0xA3276CD8
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x9581294A
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0x01A5B91B
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0xE46BEB99
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0xB89737C0
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0xFBAE6A6D
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x7C4C2F5D
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
0xD0FE4ED0

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXXIV
0xDEE708F9

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x5D5D1559
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0x5FD9FC6D
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0x6919B36E
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0xF2B26FFE
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xD45DBC7D
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x0B12EAFD
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0x5E1200FE
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x7A3559EF
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x8CD593D5
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x0802C998
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xE17143E1

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0x17856226
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0xEFBE6691
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0x11737603
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x1FA08A35
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0x46F7A950
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0xB3FE4678
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0xF8246CD9
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x530743BB
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0xF86495BB
girls.
0xCCF58EA7

0x3796A4AC
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0xF058D8B4
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x85AC71B9
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x2B2CA43C

0x3796A4AC
"Doubtless."
0x0A40F457

0x3796A4AC
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0xE36E36DE
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xBC322871

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x5D5FECF6
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0xE39436CE
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x1AA507AB
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x59393AB1

0x3796A4AC
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0xA11AB785
What are you going to do?"
0xB16BD0AA

0x3796A4AC
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0xDD8BCAC2
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x8ED6539C

0x3796A4AC
"Do you want her?"
0x60876AA9

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x602E4685
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x72E6F9C9

0x3796A4AC
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x8AFC8908
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0xB85F8451

0x3796A4AC
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x34F03A90
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x777AA9F0

0x3796A4AC
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x7FA5131B
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x5F8E1921
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0xF1DE032B
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0xDDFE8582
now?"
0x917972A7

0x3796A4AC
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0xA077D6FB
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x6EA382BC
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x2E0E659A
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0xCA4D3AD1
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x14823DCE
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x07419505
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xE0EB2AF7
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x1BDE5AFC
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x61CB0B38
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x08659486
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x02602DBB
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0xD5F0E5DE
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x782C9EB3
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0xA921DE51

0x3796A4AC
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0x2C205411

0x3796A4AC
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x8AAC2F3D
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xAB5B60B1
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x7CE9A936

0x3796A4AC
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0xC7D1B1F1

0x3796A4AC
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0x69986B0F
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0xBAC794BF

0x3796A4AC
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0xA87E744A

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xA1A25D0F
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0x64189E6D
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0xBD648F1E
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0xFE5702BD
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0x6A99B93E
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x0286050B

0x3796A4AC
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x8111FB89
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0xA65389E4
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0xF21E3019

0x3796A4AC
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0xF5948B01
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xD4171C92
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x281FAC0F
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x1DCFEC33
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0x155B2F05
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0x5B1034D0
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0xD604837C
hear, Jane?"
0x3ABD402A

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xBD77EF59
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x8BEAEB28

0x3796A4AC
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x54853D89
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0xDFAC135D
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x3DB98F34
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xBA67CD57
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xD34A9828
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x876A8C26
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0xCDFBF059
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0xE8D782AD
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x9E6B7231
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0xA29F9A6E
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0x33211CA5
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0x89910425
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0xA740740C
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0xE9144C78
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0x12BDAD39
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0xA35569D8
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0x651BF486
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0x6E3F1683
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0xC281C342
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0x4828BE51
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x8F521B82
without.
0x6A546B74

0x3796A4AC
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0xEF4D43D0
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0xA6E0A85A
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xA14FBF11

0x3796A4AC
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x8BDE8400
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0xC57E6A71
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xA63FCA5A
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0xE5F5A91A
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0xEBEFBB82
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0x75B1A15C
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x0CA4041C
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x2556B24A
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0xB321D7AE
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x3779E6C2
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x3EB0848F
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x23B99589
improved aspect of his abode.
0x8748CD6B

0x3796A4AC
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0xBB100156
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xEB09259E
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x129691EB

0x3796A4AC
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x7DE27B65
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0x06FF4842
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0xEEAEDDCE
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0xDFEAA918
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xDC3B8ACD

0x3796A4AC
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x5E64E920
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xB01B25AC

0x3796A4AC
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x054FE100
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0x10CCB505
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x1927678C
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0xAB8C0C0C
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x44032250
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0xD198F1D9
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x20DB4F75
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0x2F556C33
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x4DED1267
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x2994940C
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xB3B7CDED
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x95230ABF
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x8515EEDF
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x62D897F3
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0x386EDB46
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0xB9143515
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0xC8698259
column, gloomy and out of place.
0xC58CBE98

0x3796A4AC
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0xDD30F671
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0xD8B971D8
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0xD129E381
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x4EFF40E9
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0x359F2C75
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x79F893CC
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x8CF460A4
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x1B6B9F03
career--I see it now."
0x67F0B8FC

0x3796A4AC
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x5A7A4971
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x5FD12043
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x6BF5859E
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x51DA9DB4
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0xE3D681AB
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xEAA37250
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x9C4C1E8E
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0xD492C0F1
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0xA2353ED7
into the house.
0x7BE5212D

0x3796A4AC
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x688E7567
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x82BC1F1D
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0x29714F64
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x9C36BD13
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x5453E56F
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0x68F9F81B
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0x4624E1BB
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x291708A3

0x3796A4AC
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xCD917C55
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x51E33B5A
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xF7EC9475
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x7953E89F
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x4F83AFFB
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0xC343C946
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0x9FC3DA7B

0x3796A4AC
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0x9AD9DA3E
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x4CDBCACF
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x023EE19D
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x13D2A5C0
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x06AFFACC
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x6A98104E
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x22DED6EA
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0x715856C4
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x6A5A798E
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x31B31308
mother, who was drawing away."
0xEFFB2F16

0x3796A4AC
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xC713C434

0x3796A4AC
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x8AD9099B
the way."
0x97D42AD3

0x3796A4AC
"Tell him I will go."
0x1DD14259

0x3796A4AC
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x399E88B3
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0xCFF6AB2E
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0xB912F823
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0xCF8502F1

0x3796A4AC
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x2D858568
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x08B26114
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x55A8C5BC
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xCA5606D0
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x642613C1
with himself.
0x82533929

0x3796A4AC
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0xDAC9E3F1
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x4275C45C
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x46E7675B
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x354DC835
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x01BB40D7
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x8C24831D
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x86E10DC2
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x758A0E55
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0x54E367E1
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0x187E4F49
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0xAF4B137C

0x3796A4AC
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x627B3319
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x711823D1

0x3796A4AC
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x4D21B556
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0xB642618B
ensuing year.
0x44EFAF2D

0x3796A4AC
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x0A0342E5
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x61C5C499
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0x4476D940
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x20C45B3B

0x3796A4AC
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x23C4C967
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x23A98F57
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x241BF98B
yesterday."
0x7C4C1915

0x3796A4AC
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x18F0AB8E
he was serene as glass.
0xA24AD700

0x3796A4AC
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x432417AB
known each other long."
0xBFA04478

0x3796A4AC
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x724635B3
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x31C4B433
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x76CF9545
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x96483F86
can he refitted for their reception."
0xD69B11B5

0x3796A4AC
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x37FD2750
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0xDC470144
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x4D2248A9
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x2EB71226
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x8999A836
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x014FEE1E
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x64DB0D6F
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0xB83279D5
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x75370A90
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x8EF1C961
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x13F269F7
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x47862408
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x50CC0D9F
frigidity.
0x2A0641E8

0x3796A4AC
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x8D7229CB
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x3DE7C16E

0x3796A4AC
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x1462872A

0x3796A4AC
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x7E2B64B3
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xD85E74F0

0x3796A4AC
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0xB8A3DF2D
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0xD64A0816

0x3796A4AC
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0xECEA1B7C
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x53A4B00D
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x530C2AC4
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x0D7E856D

0x3796A4AC
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xFA65C0A2
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x7E51C37A
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0xE0CDFCA0
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0xEC3B59B2
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x7D43A156
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x3E0F5F09
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x1A799B89
plans.
0x073715A5

0x3796A4AC
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x51C5AB73
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xA21F49BD
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0xCA35B8B7
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x4B66DA68
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x7BD290AA
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0xB202CCC5
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x1DDBABB9
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xC4334D1C
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x94412C75
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0xEB1E2C4C
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x771268B9
the task without regard to the elements.
0xA0B9D348

0x3796A4AC
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xF3D29095
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0xEA68F03C
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x07761C01
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x8FB05056

0x3796A4AC
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x656B4A50
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0x19554DEA
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x69EF9879
was a special annoyance.
0xC73BEA90

0x3796A4AC
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xAB9304CF
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x797D8007
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x33F0F2AE
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x75A05C1D
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x73DAEAC0
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x98AD9164
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x06DC08B4
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x9AAC55BA

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0x370AC0A7

0x3796A4AC
"Learning German."
0xF12ABEC8

0x3796A4AC
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x82EA904E

0x3796A4AC
"You are not in earnest?"
0xA21FC0CA

0x3796A4AC
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0xF4EAA920

0x3796A4AC
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x9E36EA98
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x1AC4BFE7
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0xF7B4A522
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0xA71F98E2
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x838C6E76
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0x23B309AF
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0x61A72052
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0xECF82FC3
barely three months to his departure.
0xAD9089E8

0x3796A4AC
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0xDB135570
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0xC7FC289F
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0xDB633F0E
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0xDDC2020C
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x0B5871EE
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xEB2D200E

0x3796A4AC
"I know it."
0x3ED3AB22

0x3796A4AC
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0xFAA2C2CA
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x9F4D59E0
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0xAEC12A9B
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x40041874
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x45215A9F
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x203C4A54
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x80BEDDD2
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0xA90C5B44
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x582D00D6
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x77594F38
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0xBAA3D8F7
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x2BFE74D6

0x3796A4AC
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0x2DD62CDE
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0xDF818459
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x48A76644
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x984AF64F
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0xB03ED4FE

0x3796A4AC
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0x6D89E9E7
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x84C04C4E

0x3796A4AC
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x027668FB
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0xA67667DC
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0xB6F377AC
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x1680EC2E
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x47701B25
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x8D1E43DE
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0x2FFDC93C
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x2613BD23
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x7E85DADC
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x271B36CC
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x54DFE4C1
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0xF28FB155

0x3796A4AC
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0xB9FE0DF3
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x4CFABDCE
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0x4A4EC0C1
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0xF6071293
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x40B35A99
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x6ADF4CF9
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x3E6AA92D
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0x866D16C7
own.
0x8F9137D4

0x3796A4AC
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x9841923C
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x78F80EE9
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x065A43A8

0x3796A4AC
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x7F7EA350
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xC77BC0ED
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0xA767A5B5
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x6E61BA55
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0x2CCA8251
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x8A7FBDD1
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x3111D6F2
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x828F74E0

0x3796A4AC
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x48AA80CA
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x9FE6553D
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0x20E2B5AF
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x47B0D3D2
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0xFF448815
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0x4EDDFC23
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x1657DCFE
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xDD12DDB7
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x7599C6A3

0x3796A4AC
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0xDAE5FBC4
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xAE586740
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x35E37B8C
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x487B50E1
then I felt dark indeed.
0x52C274D3

0x3796A4AC
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x4E853348
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x9DF6C3FF
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xA1237C99
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0xD7C5DAF0
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x1858C59A
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x86558F30
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x3C3EA23E
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0xA9593C16

0x3796A4AC
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x912E8214
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x8AB703A4
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0x3D640BC9
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0xF7BD54EB
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x0B544D74
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x0C7C452D
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0xE15CE3BF
eyes filled again.
0x1A3A5EA0

0x3796A4AC
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0x3BB09AFC
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xD9699060
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x72F8E4CA
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x816AB111
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0x7F666B8D
as to its cause; he only said--
0xEED7E489

0x3796A4AC
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x46469F9B
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0xFD8201DC
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0xA05EDB32
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x710B7C3A
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xB8EBD5AE
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xF9B77269
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xBD1881EE
said--
0x873BFE59

0x3796A4AC
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0x0589853F

0x3796A4AC
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x70B24723

0x3796A4AC
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x10BD14BB
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0x57B84893
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x39EAF49B

0x3796A4AC
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x6C391CB8
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xF87309B1
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x93250965
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xED1A5E6B
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0xC6093061
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xB1569FD3
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0xA2AA96A0
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0x9E8908D6

0x3796A4AC
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0xF3D34168
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0xC56E09AE
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xFF7325E8
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xA59B5CD2
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x396EB760
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x450F2FAB
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0xB9D66420
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x405E09B7

0x3796A4AC
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x6640C9ED
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x6E1B451A
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x3B43EC67
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0x7BC29A58
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0xB16E3380
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0xEE96B097
last refuge for silence.
0x23830CEE

0x3796A4AC
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x40A2DB8B
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x628430E5
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x7007A70E
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x91D658FE
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0xEB54513F

0x3796A4AC
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0xA3821232
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0xFE35D1F9
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0x35AB02EB

0x3796A4AC
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xA3AE88BC
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x888F5891
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0x9E0E72E6

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x210A9288
sails on the 20th of June."
0xEA4CB1BC

0x3796A4AC
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x05AEB386

0x3796A4AC
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x7CA15CA6
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0x32F62F83
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0xC7CB2261
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xEC07BEB0
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0xCEDBB1A0
same enterprise."
0xF1A98704

0x3796A4AC
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0xCB7A5FC1
to march with the strong."
0x4C1A1C1C

0x3796A4AC
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x861C7FCF
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0x17726A8B

0x3796A4AC
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0xD4B4AB43

0x3796A4AC
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0x10C5F7C0
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x58C74EAB
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0xB0FDF3CF
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0x964E1334

0x3796A4AC
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0x0DF3359A
the first to inform them of it?"
0x1D64E01A

0x3796A4AC
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0x8B283E54
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0xA01001F3
rivet the spell.
0x14EB17F8

0x3796A4AC
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0x6D900615

0x3796A4AC
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0x1BE9C3B8

0x3796A4AC
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0x0B967128
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0xF975E652

0x3796A4AC
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0x4C426C7B
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0xFD0371EB
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x7878793A
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x08D8F1EB

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0xB282BA31

0x3796A4AC
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x1431FAF4
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0xE0076402

0x3796A4AC
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0xBE5962C8
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0x9097BD86
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x1F35FB53
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0xE0F669B6
service."
0xA36F5CA4

0x3796A4AC
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0xB9A9C24F

0x3796A4AC
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0x2B195E42
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0x38DECE5D
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0xACFCBFC1
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x4863DE6A
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x0DF5727B
for him.
0xCC29A7C2

0x3796A4AC
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x99377F81
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x0EB6C880
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0xED6226FD
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x40B5B966
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x60C8BB1B
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x2E6639E0
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0xC845CB2D
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x450DE9E7
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0x02143C66
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0xED9E4EB1
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0x3B36F24E

0x3796A4AC
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0x9CF4C72D
labours."
0xA1EC36B6

0x3796A4AC
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0x19C4D88F
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x57DFA086
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0x53F6860D
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0x42E61976

0x3796A4AC
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0xFD19AA44
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0x08ADC479
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0xDABCD9EC
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0xE1108376
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0x21CDED07
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0xA8AE482E

0x3796A4AC
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xC12054E2
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0xA78E39D1
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x07E07ECF
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x7DF75C00
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x671C14ED
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x394012C6
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0x353E7737
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x1F472534
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0xE05EC8E6
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x85BF1CFD
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xCAB28A10
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0xAD6018D8
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0xA7CE78E2
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xA8D7A418
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x5175B2F0
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xD5E1DFB7
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xE492C12C
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0x6E11E299
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x01BFB40E
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0x2C32FDFA
be to me invaluable."
0x858383B1

0x3796A4AC
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0xA963879A
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x82429BE6
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x78A14B0C
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0x50CA6C3A
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0xC6C0887A
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0xCD0540AA
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0x11785CD9

0x3796A4AC
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0xFDC8D624
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0xC4402CB2

0x3796A4AC
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:
0xF602CB22

0xE283169A

0x3796A4AC
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x55DDA45C
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x1029EF9B
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0xAA459CCB
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x96158D35
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x5243D5DF
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0xDBEB3A7B
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0x7A47653A
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x8B3A19E1
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x625B2C5E
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x406CD5B7
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0xF7B755FD
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0x887D9EFE
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0xB0F91681
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x9C353B76
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0x1D2CC6A6
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x1F6F01D4
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x90AAF595
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x794FBF7B
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x7D0BEA73
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x3FC851C5
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0xE8E0FCFE
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x58C7E662
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0x4D25F634
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x44381913
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x3E3974CB
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0xC8827A9E

0x3796A4AC
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0x5581C702
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0xC8C02A95
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0xFB4B3CD2
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x05F225DD
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0xA70A2037
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x9DB4162D
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0x44B4A307
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0x9B8F334B
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xFA195809
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0xB4797300
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x11CEE8DA
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xFE9D6C84
I will tell him so."
0x2BD93708

0x3796A4AC
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x068851AD
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x15D4A034
his feet and approached me.
0xA34B5EF7

0x3796A4AC
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0xC9A1A440

0x3796A4AC
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0xD639ADC5

0x3796A4AC
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0x7F333846
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x28CC897C

0x3796A4AC
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x321406DC
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x0F54CC0B
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0xD6829D3B
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x2BD62AAF
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x1834A673
sense will guide you."
0x7800DB46

0x3796A4AC
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0x59D33547
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x5F93D6B6
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0x3221D252
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0x5EF8B726
continue."
0x3E2715EA

0x3796A4AC
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0xDE7C1046
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0xA6EBBE57
have said that."
0x9B51D3B4

0x3796A4AC
"Conditionally."
0x887D5A94

0x3796A4AC
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0x60286D93
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0x5BBC43FF
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0x16665CDF
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0x589C065C
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x82B4E079
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0xED4E7D42
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x870CCE9B
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x2B6D40BA
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x61C453E0
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0x0BDD9118
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0x591213B8

0x3796A4AC
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x25449F3F
my limbs.
0x9E7889E1

0x3796A4AC
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0x0841E345

0x3796A4AC
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0x2552DECF
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0xD96071D3
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0x1551787D

0x3796A4AC
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0x56A69B63
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0x7C3033CE
them he has no use: I retain them."
0x4BABA10C

0x3796A4AC
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0x5E7AF807
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x97CC7E79
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x5D3A5CF0
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0x132740DD

0x3796A4AC
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0x4DE989F2

0x3796A4AC
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0x4FACFC70
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0xD55DFDCD
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x80556B17
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0xFA9BF5C8
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x4100D85A
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0xBD395468
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0x42DC5486
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0xF5B01CE2
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x990859B2
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x1E946076
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0xC03BDCE0
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0xC518CBA2
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xCB7B8487

0x3796A4AC
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0xFBC33FD1
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0xDC9C44B2

0x3796A4AC
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x4937B4FC
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0xEF2FBF5B
this signify?"
0xEA69FD7E

0x3796A4AC
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xF5A4C2B2
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0xE2D88BDB
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x028D9BE3
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x5C24C25B
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0xFA4E60B1
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x66EE7318
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x0450D5B7
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0xD5D80136
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0x09962316
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x520ACC82
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x96C7CBE6
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xE1A23026
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0x54DA52A3

0x3796A4AC
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x9016D8A5
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0xCAE65A24
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xCA7B6C25
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x6C4C0414
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0xF2458971
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x3E2FDD99
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x485BA20E
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x3251DE30
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x01E14593
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x2DA44BF7
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x4F3623C9
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xD222DE99
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0xB4B44A11
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x6D9E99D2
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x40FD87FC
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x2C81C4B6
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x7B30195A
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0xB7D35231
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0x2791DFC6
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x7C6D62BB
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x75C321E8
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x6D515EF4

0x3796A4AC
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x15900ECC

0x3796A4AC
"Well?" he answered icily.
0xE2D3940E

0x3796A4AC
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0xCDB01FAC
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0xF29F5CBB

0x3796A4AC
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0x4836CCC1
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x22003878
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0xB49CCC54
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0xA161DD6D
tribes--and unwed?"
0xE75032B7

0x3796A4AC
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0x0BCC962E
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x832F7B44
yourself."
0xAD25C075

0x3796A4AC
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x88598FF3
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0xE551EDD1
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x3E9461AA
heart and--it would not do."
0xA029304D

0x3796A4AC
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0x5612CD04
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0x6CBFDB8B
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x4BB24DAA
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0xC7B5E73E
nothing more--don't fear."
0xB364E796

0x3796A4AC
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x243D3F7A
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x97BC570C
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x58A72288
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0x66B788AD
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0x75E72F9F
eyes."
0xC876A1DB

0x3796A4AC
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x8635EDEA
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x3548C179
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0x8A4C68E0
offer it."
0xDA7CA7F0

0x3796A4AC
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0xB662B44B
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x4AE89581
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0x1692C42B

0x3796A4AC
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x048C3050
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x7C9834BE

0x3796A4AC
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x17401D2B

0x3796A4AC
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0x9D2E3E62
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x06AEBE7C
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xF7374B90
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x3F8BE0A6
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x7CDD4696
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x3D789CA0

0x3796A4AC
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0x10ED8DD8
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0xAEB04D87
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x09329A0C
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0x5C479D46
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x827FEB35
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0xA5D3E4C1
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x3061BD06
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0x34909D62
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0x3DB4B12B
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xA3D4A4A4

0x3796A4AC
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x792477D7

0x3796A4AC
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x22430F35

0x3796A4AC
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x1A3FB740
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0x21635092
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0xB7B005E5
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0xB491416B
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0x4DEF59E8
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xB6D8B6E9
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x57797C20
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x43BBD5A7
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xABC38078

0x3796A4AC
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0xDAEE210D
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0xFC27220F
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x9AF33617
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0x6C09B2ED

0x3796A4AC
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0xEB47BB38
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x2CE48B62
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0x58B088A5

0x3796A4AC
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0x4F7D959E
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0xFF98C90A
stairs.
0x438521BF

0x3796A4AC
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0x64AAA42F

0x3796A4AC
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x2C7D2BDC

0x3796A4AC
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x00F38260

0x3796A4AC
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x0BCCAEBE
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x94509F7B
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x16F10688
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x753209AA
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xF151BF2F
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0xD2DBE67B
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0xD4CEDD66

0x3796A4AC
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0xE3F5A256
down.
0x5FBDEDB3

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXXV
0x21933B05

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0x58207E59
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0xF3822D0C
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x223E9868
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x6C207321
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x332B99C3
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x46E527C2

0x3796A4AC
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0x3133A0CC
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0x1018E3F7
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0xDF51510F
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x2C249805
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x6F79FCD7
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0xC1C3C66F
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x1EEB1885
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x0D31CDFD
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x1FAF05CF

0x3796A4AC
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x4ED3290E
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x973BB708
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x83B7A69F
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x421CE931
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0x1E2A612A
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x41B40799
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x8DE02397
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0x7FCC6E90
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0xB36A1C57

0x3796A4AC
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x06DAD7B1
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0x06EE667C
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x74BCA71E
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0xCE795FE1
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0xCAB52885
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x8ADA1C99
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0xCD4DE668
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0xBEB647FB
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x665D10F1
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x748B8446
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0xB0C98656
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x2EE08DE7
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x56E09B83
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x46CFF5A1
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x87CA396A

0x3796A4AC
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0xB64B1ABF
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x227BD7BB
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x6C9AA271
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0xB5808336
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0xFF008067
spoke to the point at once.
0x212B7A62

0x3796A4AC
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x03488438
friends."
0x5D593D6F

0x3796A4AC
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0x56F80091
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x33FD890C

0x3796A4AC
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x820B7FBB

0x3796A4AC
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0xAC2A5CEF
good."
0x6886D534

0x3796A4AC
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0x9454F40A
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x0B6C2089
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x55F88642
strangers."
0x890D3B6B

0x3796A4AC
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x2E68C962
regarding you as a stranger."
0x143164DC

0x3796A4AC
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x245BAE9F
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0xCD8A334A
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0xF3A322F8
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x69F93686
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x21DC23BF
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0xA90D8473

0x3796A4AC
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x3566E38B
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0xD2BE10EF

0x3796A4AC
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0xA0BDF6B8

0x3796A4AC
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x1F51B8E0
India?"
0x7DBAEBE3

0x3796A4AC
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xCA7FC8E0

0x3796A4AC
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x3832C77E

0x3796A4AC
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x9BC43E33
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0xEBC0DB89
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0xDA851387

0x3796A4AC
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0xF0442134

0x3796A4AC
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x4952396E
crash down.
0xCD4E37AF

0x3796A4AC
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0xF992B9C1

0x3796A4AC
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0xCFB6EE1F
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0x8992BF14
You are killing me now."
0x1EEDC703

0x3796A4AC
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x701116CA

0x3796A4AC
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0x160BD126
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x02AA04DC
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0xDC463F22
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0xFD2AFE64
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xD563070A

0x3796A4AC
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0xEBBE735A
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0xCE6021CF
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0x197502B5

0x3796A4AC
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0x0F969D44
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0xC10B3393

0x3796A4AC
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0xE15B0C2C
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xADF60355
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0xDFF72DF2

0x3796A4AC
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0x1921979A
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0x75502434

0x3796A4AC
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x2B515411
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x753A4CAF
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xE17C1B35

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x1AA0D63A

0x3796A4AC
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0xE4FE29A0
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x7FFF0481
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x5A5F2044
spoke at last.
0x6854CFDF

0x3796A4AC
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xA1F6D79E
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0xD775F4CB
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x57F691A3
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x2378C329
sake."
0x51C9E659

0x3796A4AC
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0xA9C041CA
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x84AB2EDF
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0xC54E6DE2
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0xBD035684
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x99C4B3EA
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x2CCAA909

0x3796A4AC
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x71488F73
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x06B8C3B0

0x3796A4AC
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0xAEF82EDD
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0xE000FCDB
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x8D814D2A
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0x6B189814
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0xF1E15392
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0x86985B59

0x3796A4AC
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0x4B632C97
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x897A1E58
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0x260499EE

0x3796A4AC
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0xDE80545A
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x437AC3BE
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x592CF68A
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0xCF7AB598
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0x06486693

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0xEC2CABB0

0x3796A4AC
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x1B4519A4
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0x102CEEEA
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x028E3BB4
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0xBE2B0CD3
leaving it."
0x5E5B64DC

0x3796A4AC
"What do you mean?"
0x9F223FA3

0x3796A4AC
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0xB430E5F8
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x7394642B
some means that doubt is removed."
0x81A0FE42

0x3796A4AC
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x9D370A7A
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0xCF489EDC
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0x684EF814
Rochester?"
0x2D971E76

0x3796A4AC
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xA56A733A

0x3796A4AC
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x3B59814A

0x3796A4AC
"I must find out what is become of him."
0xD016CFC0

0x3796A4AC
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x2A83A949
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0xD99FACEB
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x24148737
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0x58B28110

0x3796A4AC
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xE2BE888E
was soon out of sight.
0x7CD3303C

0x3796A4AC
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xB6C9CC5C
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x52C2DF4D
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x56CEBFB5

0x3796A4AC
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0x4D4A3FA0
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x90138B70
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x117B1CB0
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0xB5386779
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x31C0BF13

0x3796A4AC
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xCDA037B0

0x3796A4AC
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x72BA2E23
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x770F66FD
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0xE3CD58D0
Jane?"
0x2C36C3D6

0x3796A4AC
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x2D8C3434

0x3796A4AC
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0xCCC53307
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0x7A04D98D
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x28A6014E

0x3796A4AC
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x4BF1A239

0x3796A4AC
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0x3FBC68E0
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x555884EC

0x3796A4AC
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0xB65540D3
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0xFC6A92AE

0x3796A4AC
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x74DAF9BC

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x9F1ADA8A
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x450940C5

0x3796A4AC
"I have refused to marry him--"
0x43D49B52

0x3796A4AC
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0xB1551C75

0x3796A4AC
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0xA25F66FC
as his sister."
0xC2D57A32

0x3796A4AC
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x82037CA9
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0xD85C6DA1
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xA54E2900
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xB57D91B3
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x36B360FF
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x83878BCD
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0xDD34145F

0x3796A4AC
"Not as a husband."
0xFB664E26

0x3796A4AC
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0xB6CF1EB7

0x3796A4AC
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x80FF497D

0x3796A4AC
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x23020357
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0x10CC5C09
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x077592C6

0x3796A4AC
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0xF64DEF7C
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x106538EE
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x9780AA6B
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x6D6CE921
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xBAF1D36B

0x3796A4AC
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0x98715518

0x3796A4AC
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x3D8864C5
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x5ECE2F09
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0xC62ED3C2
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x7078EECE
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0xFF3FEC9F
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x26E8DED5

0x3796A4AC
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xF357544F

0x3796A4AC
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x9399D5B4
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x2ECFB72A
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x045ABA83
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0xFA235647
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0xDC7E3CDD
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x09623B05
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xF1C274F4
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0xB8641EE1

0x3796A4AC
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0xC1A436DC

0x3796A4AC
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x823AE077
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0x8A029784
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x9AA460A8
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0xB39C12E5
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x862D043D

0x3796A4AC
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0xA516D5A7
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0xB6075E60
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0xFC5AEBB9
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x62787A50
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0xCE6BED48
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0x158C2E77
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x292C46BF
had forgiven me once more.
0x6A8DD5DD

0x3796A4AC
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x9AE00443
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0xD2053291
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x358D94FB
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x1E534FFC
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x4815CC45
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x8270DDDA
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0xC806A7F7
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x7CF63901
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0xFC00AE5D
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0x2C10AE55
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0xBF015C61
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0xAB9DFCD7
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0xF6560E39
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x92A665F3

0x3796A4AC
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x0F312955
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0x402CC171
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x7A53EF8D

0x3796A4AC
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x5D338363
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x5ACA71FE
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x4FEA25A8
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0xD68322F8

0x3796A4AC
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0xED46E481

0x3796A4AC
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0x887C8A03
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x5C8AECDD
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x3D417BDD
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0x63BFC96A
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x24A19F32
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x9EC723D0
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xFED5BB9F

0x3796A4AC
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0xD06E2BD8
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x085A0AD9
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x8C90E672
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x5F559390
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x75B54CD1
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x36C39EDA
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x37528691
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0xC3C492F4
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0xB82317B3
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x0F348409
could not but feel it too.
0xA618E1E4

0x3796A4AC
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x33F53D62
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0xEA8692DF
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0x88991DBA
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0x7E3E1FD8

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x1A7B48AB
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x03E0D340
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x0F4CB85A
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x604B0F2E
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x561E61D2
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x9DAD9B32
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x406BFA94
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x85990CF6
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x9AFCFC60
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0x87882B61
from you!"
0xDBF924CC

0x3796A4AC
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0xA001211B
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x457BF4FD
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x901F270E
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x0B1E5805
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0xA2F2BFEC
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0xC21CC38C
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xADC043EC
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x4511D60E
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x1D089A16
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x30CE0DBF
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xBA4D92E9
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0xCEF501B2
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x4CA035BE
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x22E4DF62
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x2F9B052E
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x82B9833C

0x3796A4AC
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0x94DF12AD
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x9094D93E
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x0A4996EA
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x96A50A5B
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x27D73E09
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xE5981D61
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x57162FFF
dim room was full of visions.
0x52E73565

0x3796A4AC
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x29660B2D
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0xE0C25BFC
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0xEA864D5A
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0xF523766E
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0xC1EA2B95
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xF8651CE9
prayer: it was only elevated.
0xDA1E046D

0x3796A4AC
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0x102A936D
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x7A754676
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xC10A6D39

0x3796A4AC
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0xA6ACCF54
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x580EF32A
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x2989C1B1
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x5BA84FA5
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x08142038
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0xE4422105
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x0C8D0D3D
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0xC08F1F91
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0xA86A060B
shall judge.
0x1F21D784

0x3796A4AC
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x7E1DE545
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x6155A075
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xB107D9D2
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0xA98A8867
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x60C2BCB0
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x28DAC2D5
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x115A34EF
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0xC4DD4E52
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x69524B62
bones.
0xC90D94DD

0x3796A4AC
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0xD608457A
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x514A8CA9

0x3796A4AC
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x391611C9

0x3796A4AC
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0xB9DFC6BB

0x3796A4AC
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x2C45636A
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x870E1FA3
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x3B85E698
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xC1D570A1
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x22C6E439
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x0F7048B1

0x3796A4AC
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0xCF875B72
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x168D4D15
garden: it was void.
0xF2CC9E95

0x3796A4AC
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0xE98746CD

0x3796A4AC
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x90CB0A83
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0x537F875B
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x50C4B8B7

0x3796A4AC
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0x0EE46645
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0x1DA9E63E
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0x1E0D9ECF
best."
0xD754633D

0x3796A4AC
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0xDE3D55E2
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0xFD2BEFD2
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0xA64A8C54
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x75571294
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x283594A8
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0x2AD06D9D
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0xAC06D51F
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0xB42D95A8
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x43D23D84
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
0x26D8B64B

CHAPTER XXXVI
0x95EE297A

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0x3720980E
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x385D03BB
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x5EC3A596
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x64BFF87F
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0x349FC2C8
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x685982EF

0x3796A4AC
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x3FBDC806
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0x662CE023
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x253472D9
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x93B2A4A2
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x6E44FACC
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x1611FADA

0x3796A4AC
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0xEFCBE101
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0xD4F506FF
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0x96A6985A
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x1934B0F4
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0x4D484EC8

0x3796A4AC
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xC9CCFC63
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x984D54E4
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x10147B8E
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x490E4A2D
would meet the coach.
0xE2E4B647

0x3796A4AC
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x3FF0EF13
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xBBEB88D2
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0x2A492109

0x3796A4AC
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x05A007E0
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0xFB84155A
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0x7A2B8D64
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x678B56CE
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x23A5C451
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x22A001D1
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x59F56F6E
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x8477B2FC
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0xBF1B7C19
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0xB87E3145
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x636C0269
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x8F3CC294
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x6CB4D329
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0xEC5A6F14
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x285847CB
body.
0xC5A3F1E4

0x3796A4AC
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x4C451D8B
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x96076666
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x137CFC66

0x3796A4AC
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x91DCC9CA
and should be absent at least four days.
0xF6F2A241

0x3796A4AC
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0xD180E565

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x4D3C738C
time been uneasy."
0xC6AB4934

0x3796A4AC
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0xDACFA2AB
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0xED02AAB3
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x211860F1
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0x05A1F391
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0xF7DFFD3C
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x01BE9E97

0x3796A4AC
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x06D0D7BE
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x38F4549F
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0xAD42447D
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0xD58F2744
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x2915B670

0x3796A4AC
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0xD0CBFDDB
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x0225FF6D
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x3DEB96B0
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x4A90D77D
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0x2F03D786
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x47540CFE
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x4A3348A6
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x2D2C4173
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x0E8891E1

0x3796A4AC
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0x6A56700C
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x7DC3CD94
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0xCDC389B2
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x400D069F
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xAB4575DB
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x2C1D34FF
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0xF0F3B29B
we were near my bourne.
0xA7A12094

0x3796A4AC
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xB272172C

0x3796A4AC
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x74DABEFD

0x3796A4AC
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0xD5CC0703
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x7628846F
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0x4DFA1330
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x3D63989D
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0xE9D42F75
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0x6949ACC4

0x3796A4AC
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0xA2BAFF12
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0x07CDE4AC
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x0043E750
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x1570AF8A
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x89F0E972
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xB63B69A6
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0x0575A6C7
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x9EB5E590

0x3796A4AC
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0xD25E85DE
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xC0D30963
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x251F0DEC
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0x1D5560EE
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x841C5154
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xB78E0781
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0xFC9D0FB4
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x2F3541F1
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0xA7E0339E
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x6DECFCCB
them!
0xDB293E43

0x3796A4AC
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x33E04EDE
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x2DE3EEA6
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x2DEB5AB3
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x62771C38
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xE6BFECCA
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0xFDC060A7
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x5B67463B
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x75FDB2CF
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0xE5399E3A
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0xF08016EC
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x52397F43
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x65578596
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0xAB209EC7
tideless sea of the south."
0x77C05CF8

0x3796A4AC
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x1F014D78
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x31174F92
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x1AA957C3
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x22406ACB
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x04960409
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x8BCF2410
station were at my command.
0x2B3E2B56

0x3796A4AC
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0x5CD60E4E
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x0A5E05CD
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x7C1427A7
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0xBE54EBD0
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x322B84F5
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xB37A54CB
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0xD3454A5B
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x3E7BF233

0x3796A4AC
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x39C922A7

0x3796A4AC
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x0EFF73FE
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0x26CFCF08
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x4DDEFB0D
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xCCF6A5B0
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0xC4EE32D7
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0xAB308F05
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x52B8D830
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x1E3B644E
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x1DA6782E
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0x50BFC34C
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x50EB64F4
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x46CB727C
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0xABDDAE4B

0x3796A4AC
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xE2220AD2
ruin.
0xCDBE3EC2

0x3796A4AC
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0xFA8721AD
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x06A8CBF9
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x0C7A3331
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x63E02AA8
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x94D5594D
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x01F8A916
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x8872A995

0x3796A4AC
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x4852056D
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0xFE188A19
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0x4ED63E7B
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0xEFFCBFD7
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0x552821AD
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0xE1D9D587
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0xA629DD7D
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x001DDBB6
token.
0x7C524074

0x3796A4AC
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x1DF81551
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0xE58191F9
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x7538EC41
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x8988A6DB
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0xE4CAB225
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x735713AD
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0xDA6C0F9F
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0xBB882258
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0xEAC9A889
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x5425CAD5

0x3796A4AC
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x2617889F
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x5D739FD6
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0x35A8EB65
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0xA439032B
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x77DDDA69
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x7B55AA84
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x775729B2

0x3796A4AC
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0xB5F4B7EA

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0xA1610088

0x3796A4AC
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0xC64F6A11

0x3796A4AC
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0x2642B741

0x3796A4AC
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0xD5F21EC2
trying to evade.
0x095E69FD

0x3796A4AC
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0x295E3B94

0x3796A4AC
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xBE6F0857
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0xE6EFD2DC
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0x5ECD608B
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x53B2628E
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x0115356C
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0x9C913A94
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0xCC98BE8C
Antipodes.
0x2F68E54E

0x3796A4AC
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x686B745A
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x1EDF95A1
direct question as to where he really was.
0x9446F10F

0x3796A4AC
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x9B7DA7F9
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0xFDBAE1B6
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x47B5BC92
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xC44AF8D5
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0x664044D0
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0xDDF31E22
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x8B7B14BD
witnessed it myself."
0x33D4367B

0x3796A4AC
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x67E99799
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x0BCAFF4D

0x3796A4AC
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0xDA440744
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x1E5CC949
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0xBFC76067
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0x0FD5E9B4

0x3796A4AC
"I have heard something of it."
0x087BD78B

0x3796A4AC
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x2A9BFB7C
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x42A501D0
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0xA7A03B70
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x4E983464
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0x5252913E
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0x01AC24A4

0x3796A4AC
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0xF51CB240
main fact.
0x62FF7DD4

0x3796A4AC
"And this lady?"
0x4897AAA7

0x3796A4AC
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0x0ED9D73E
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xEEF72610
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x24FDDDAE

0x3796A4AC
"But the fire," I suggested.
0xE5F3FDEA

0x3796A4AC
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x6DE5FF85
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x561D6265
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0xE338D13A
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0x7F5FA1FE
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x8AD4FAF7
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x90DF2E7A
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x41198D1A
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x2990C71E
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xDFF205BC
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x11460A1E

0x3796A4AC
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0x1D1EA72B
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0xBFA1F5FA
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xB2C57DD7

0x3796A4AC
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x1B45DB84
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x9956CBB5
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0x7AB1766F
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0xD353E974
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x662DD9BD
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x99AABA34
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0x3829D9C7
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0xD37FDF6E
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0xEF8D9B01
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x1E4D42DD
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0x905DEF95
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xEC00A380
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x69E5B890
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0x3F15C3E2
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x985E5D6A
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0xA5399C74
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x249D8198
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0xD8A192DA
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x68BB89BF
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0xD035B5A4
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0xEEE1BD5F
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x8DB3991A
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x9B2DD982
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x8732130E
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xC477AC10
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0x19255E6D

0x3796A4AC
"What! did he not leave England?"
0x5C9B6C9E

0x3796A4AC
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x285D1575
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xCBCE75E3
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0xC4431B62
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0x076BC5D3
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x899D2BD4
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0xC5AA35E7
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x8F7E169D
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x83966735
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xFF622576
Thornfield Hall."
0x56C5684F

0x3796A4AC
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xC952C4EF

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x5F1128F8
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x013D4873
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xC07037DD
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x24B1CB4C
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0xE9483F6F
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0xB267B43C
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x06FF16CF
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0x99807D15
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0x4F91A5FC
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0xB31252DB
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x8F6A1889
pavement."
0xE20102F3

0x3796A4AC
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0x73442568

0x3796A4AC
"Dead?"
0xCD9AF0DF

0x3796A4AC
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x1AF4D2AA
scattered."
0x1A19074B

0x3796A4AC
"Good God!"
0x58E2AB7F

0x3796A4AC
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0x5D03DCC5

0x3796A4AC
He shuddered.
0x2E348CAF

0x3796A4AC
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0xCE32ACAF

0x3796A4AC
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0x1B015689
only some bits of walls standing now."
0x9B13CDFA

0x3796A4AC
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x9C3E0078

0x3796A4AC
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0x13635A81

0x3796A4AC
"What do you mean?"
0x9F223FA3

0x3796A4AC
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0x13988D22
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0x576ECA43
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x9413EF8C
pity him, for my part."
0x7983629C

0x3796A4AC
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0x2CB1546E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x75CAABBB

0x3796A4AC
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0xC02E81E7
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x71150083

0x3796A4AC
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0x66A88429
fixture now."
0xFD051827

0x3796A4AC
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0x69D4F55D

0x3796A4AC
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0x3508231A
Edward."
0x15E913DD

0x3796A4AC
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0xE6E70437
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x5595E2DD

0x3796A4AC
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x84A8DC38
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x76EA5296
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x02AADCBF
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0xABDAD3EB
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0xB3392674
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x8A77DC63
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x1F5B7083
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x04BA4B61
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0x53863042

0x3796A4AC
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0x0AE806F4

0x3796A4AC
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0x9D4D5FC4
quite a desolate spot."
0x10CB43AA

0x3796A4AC
"Who is with him?"
0x0428E967

0x3796A4AC
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0xE705E2D9
down, they say."
0x91055D89

0x3796A4AC
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x1BBB77B7

0x3796A4AC
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0x02BC19AD

0x3796A4AC
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0x4E395835
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0x12904B52
you usually demand."
0x6414E531

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXXVII
0x003EBE7B

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x51816611
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xF991FA1E
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0xB93B304D
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0xC09FE791
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x37D663F5
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x00157562
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x11F2641A
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x51B15D1A
there in the season to shoot.
0x3F9566C0

0x3796A4AC
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0xDAE697DE
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0xBD844B9B
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x6EA27F3C
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x296B11FB
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0x8D65FFE4
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x34FA4F30
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x5883CFDA
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0xD77E1BF8
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x2427DDA2
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0x8DBE7D37
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0x6A848650
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x5BC75236

0x3796A4AC
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x856FDF02
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0xC563D8BC
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x48F6941D
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0xA8B18A41

0x3796A4AC
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0xCEC019DE
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xE32F50B1
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x7A0A7885
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x338FAF9C
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0xDFD5AF21
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x206E1A36
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x598C564B
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x2244FD08
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0x629FAAFF
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x2A4CA9F3
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0x538F7F86
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0x4D792D37

0x3796A4AC
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0x23C4103D

0x3796A4AC
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x5DCAA278
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0x1445F114
grange.
0x1C65C61D

0x3796A4AC
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0x86548A69
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x33D4112F
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0xFDFDDA75
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x8443244E

0x3796A4AC
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0x53B390E4
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0xB99B41F9
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x617D0D89
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x4A7BEBB5
advance.
0x00C5F6EF

0x3796A4AC
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0x1ED65E3D
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0xDABA15B0
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xB78EB9BF
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x94A43D54
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0xBE6AA7ED
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x07BD870B
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0xBF9AB01D
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0xBDCFD583

0x3796A4AC
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0xE8C55C8D
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x6FD91C3C
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0xA07A65FA
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0xD3D469B5

0x3796A4AC
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xD365D9F0
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x7C147C4C
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xA2BA0B7A
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0xF2C0986B
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0xB3453957
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x427795A5
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0x00F4D9FE
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0xDA12CCFA
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x31C8CDE7
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0x92FC2103
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0xFC112FC1

0x3796A4AC
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xC7981457
had you not better go in?"
0x5CEAFCF1

0x3796A4AC
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x7B3B351F

0x3796A4AC
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0xCB127DC7
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0xB10BFFD6
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0x4DC24429

0x3796A4AC
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x4F5D866F
"how are you?"
0x9AA47BB4

0x3796A4AC
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0xB5A905F1
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0xAC94FA8A
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0xB992390A
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x5F7FF991
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x93ABBF02
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x6CF86DAA
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0xF4FCC593
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0xF3346C1E
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x46182773
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x50EF407E
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0x600EB8BA
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0x4185D0A0

0x3796A4AC
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xA18CDA41
to him, but do not give my name."
0x8814B408

0x3796A4AC
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xD3DB4097

0x3796A4AC
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x1234A593
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0xD636A4AC
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x17F757FF

0x3796A4AC
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xF982348D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x0654E983

0x3796A4AC
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0x3A434DE0

0x3796A4AC
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x42A026C7
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x4B8067A6
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0xEA873700

0x3796A4AC
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x94D3766A
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x4B641C6E
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x5C450EF5
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x8E5BE702
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x12F5118E
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x520C235C
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x7F065DC1
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0xFA93C437
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0xD61B0114
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x10A7BDEA

0x3796A4AC
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0xA7718B4E

0x3796A4AC
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x11CE203E
still excited.
0x2A4D6A4C

0x3796A4AC
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0x117EEA60

0x3796A4AC
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x37A70249
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x15F5D84D
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x024D7DC1

0x3796A4AC
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x6003C6A7

0x3796A4AC
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0xD87C2D94
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x1EEAE4F6
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0xF4D54448
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x75A52176
and aloud.

0x3796A4AC
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0xEF897527
glass," I said.
0xA21B0556

0x3796A4AC
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0x75E29E09

0x3796A4AC
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x9A96E8D9
evening," I answered.
0xD593AB4E

0x3796A4AC
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0xE12DC154
seized me?"
0x18CEC62C

0x3796A4AC
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x402EE37C
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x8BA54CC0

0x3796A4AC
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x601BE16A
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0x85B5A281
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0xE0F4BB1A

0x3796A4AC
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x717C20C8

0x3796A4AC
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x5457C6F9
must be more of her."
0x0230C9AC

0x3796A4AC
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xE1B1A66B
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0xDE586FC7

0x3796A4AC
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0xCBBD9015

0x3796A4AC
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0xCB5BF9D4
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x99D5223A

0x3796A4AC
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x060868AE

0x3796A4AC
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0x64770DE2
come back to you."
0xA332015F

0x3796A4AC
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0x69D7FC73

0x3796A4AC
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x203F7EF9
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x71BE41DF

0x3796A4AC
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0xE608718C
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x7BC870EF
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0x1FD242CA
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x53FEFBB9
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x635FB23D

0x3796A4AC
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0xD5325FA9

0x3796A4AC
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x012FB3B7
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0xC8ABC9E5
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0x30A1AAFC
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0x95053CD9
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0xDCE2CC0D
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0xB6A252F3

0x3796A4AC
"There, sir--and there!"'
0xBC4C9A21

0x3796A4AC
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x4EC87BA6
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xC0F2DA5A
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0xD2C88290

0x3796A4AC
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x6F7F7FE5

0x3796A4AC
"I am."
0x46EF17DA

0x3796A4AC
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0xF25AF5C1
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x93F0F500

0x3796A4AC
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0xBCA81CB9

0x3796A4AC
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x92C6C6A4

0x3796A4AC
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0x656DE41D

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0xAEC44139
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0x3B9776CB
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x15734604
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x436058C8

0x3796A4AC
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0x76EA8FCF
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0xBB4BCEF2
company of an evening."
0x38EB0E82

0x3796A4AC
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xFD95CA79
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0x3ED71A79
me?"
0x826209F6

0x3796A4AC
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x0A49B08C
mistress."
0x8DDE94D0

0x3796A4AC
"And you will stay with me?"
0x73399192

0x3796A4AC
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x29E7CEE2
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0x6C1B7E9B
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0x4074208F
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x5F18A798
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x80F73C6E

0x3796A4AC
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0x243F5221
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xF9D1D27D
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xE86ABFC6
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x682CD791
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0xFAC42B2B
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0x5C6E9AA7
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x8ACE5358
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x21ECF3D8
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x7865EDCF
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x61D03C6E
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x23B98E81

0x3796A4AC
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0xFDA10C6D
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x7E72FBEC
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x43BCFE45
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0xF2A99D58
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x5AA40DF3
vengeance on its frame."
0x77A0E733

0x3796A4AC
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0xDC1FC4D0

0x3796A4AC
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x0F8C103E
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0xE0A0D16C
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x8338A114
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x04E01369
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0xDE07EAC0
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0xC64B3112
Come--tell me."
0x4B5088B4

0x3796A4AC
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x19C6CC59
you think it better."
0xE71180CC

0x3796A4AC
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0xEB4DBAB3
one day."
0x936A9C9C

0x3796A4AC
"I don't care about being married."
0xCC86AEFA

0x3796A4AC
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0x068B8609
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0xFC37021A

0x3796A4AC
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x36ACD354
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0xB2E62BD0
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0xA9821A17
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x08F92387
conversation.
0xCF8F2C92

0x3796A4AC
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xD7E6E1C8
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0xF692ABFD
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x0A3945B3
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xF85D956D
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0xE386231D
not yet noticed."
0xD52368DA

0x3796A4AC
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x12CF1685
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xA1195692
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x4F7B295C

0x3796A4AC
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x9CA44608
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0xA491AA59
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xC3751BFB

0x3796A4AC
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x6CD97213
cicatrised visage."
0x33D0B1DB

0x3796A4AC
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x234562AD
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x36EA1A38
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xBBB9381F

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x401D668B

0x3796A4AC
"And you see the candles?"
0x6289AD98

0x3796A4AC
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xD5E38B43

0x3796A4AC
"Can you see me?"
0x673D59F0

0x3796A4AC
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0xA1C7B883

0x3796A4AC
"When do you take supper?"
0xC1D4D79B

0x3796A4AC
"I never take supper."
0xAD005809

0x3796A4AC
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0x1BE833D3
only you forget."
0x2111B627

0x3796A4AC
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0xD498DA33
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xD212FBE7
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x10753AAC
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0x6C226E02
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0x02C9309E
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x46C69B3F
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xE6FE0DEA
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0xB1667DAD
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xC79F5399
lineaments softened and warmed.
0x7AE2C0C5

0x3796A4AC
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x79E54AD0
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x8330A217
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0xC201F13C
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0xF5F8A370
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x51290C14
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0x3E505D9B
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0x0CDA384B

0x3796A4AC
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0xA49D1419

0x3796A4AC
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0xA02ED2DB
p422.jpg}
0x64D244D6

0x3796A4AC
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0xDA818A79

0x3796A4AC
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0xB5E44450
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0x475E94CF
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x2521C081
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0xC4C83AFF

0x3796A4AC
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0x903BDAF3

0x3796A4AC
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0x121DF501
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x3563BE8D
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x298B83C9
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0x9D10896C
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x6ED115B1
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0x5CC8E145
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x53F68C4E
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x0BBF0799
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0x1B7B3D0C

0x3796A4AC
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x028554F1
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x9EDFAD4B
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0x926CDE01
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x100AADFD
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0x0DA9DB4F

0x3796A4AC
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0xE531F7AB
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0xE96D721A
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0x466AAF21
undiscoverable?
0x2C10A189

0x3796A4AC
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0x38DDD91B

0x3796A4AC
"What for, Jane?"
0x72675AF1

0x3796A4AC
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0x09492196
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x2CEC63D1
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0xCE82A9EF

0x3796A4AC
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0xFD76AE8D

0x3796A4AC
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x9EFC31C5

0x3796A4AC
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0xB08B6934
sojourned."
0xD9478BE0

0x3796A4AC
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0x30677D0D
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0x3C2DBA3A
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0xEE66D9C7

0x3796A4AC
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0x8EB32EFB

0x3796A4AC
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0x8136C2FF
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0xDAFF2A43
substantiality."
0xEDDBE580

0x3796A4AC
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x2598252B

0x3796A4AC
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xAF918D84
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0xAEAFA85C
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x430D398B
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0x6E5F6DEE
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0x763D7D12
ham."
0x3DC8096D

0x3796A4AC
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0xE353BF43
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0xD83595AF
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0x55857F9B
harp."
0xEA766FF4

0x3796A4AC
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x9AD93E70
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xC7756614
night."
0x96A5812B

0x3796A4AC
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0xF14E2888
been?"
0x844AF268

0x3796A4AC
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0xF991D415
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0x636EBEB6
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0xD2556B93

0x3796A4AC
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0xA1338DB1
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x6A17C9B5
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xC24A60E1
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0x9BE7D05B

0x3796A4AC
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x9A16DAF1
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0xF990B8A4
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0xE340AAA8
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x39F8AA19
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0xFEB08201
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x805BCA32
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x4968973B
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x7B617998
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x8D8023F5
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x0444697F
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0xBC252609

0x3796A4AC
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0xE30CC7B7
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x77DC982A
soon."
0x7C262EDD

0x3796A4AC
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x9D64C0E9

0x3796A4AC
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x9F51AFF5
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xDAF1EF8A
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0xCBF4D127
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x9FF7E16E
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0xFA2E9811
can feel is in her presence."
0xC1812CFF

0x3796A4AC
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x479A76E7
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x71B11F93
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x1D053088
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0xA01A2ECD

0x3796A4AC
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x9764A546
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0xFB76AD86
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x782553A9
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x88C53261
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x27091306
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0x3E5B3A05
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x423CB536
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0xBACF8427

0x3796A4AC
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x0868738D
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x05CA8581
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x84D420E9
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x79421A52
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0xDC089CDC
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x6C5E685E
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0xCE000642
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xAF2A31B9

0x3796A4AC
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x7693D26B
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x2EC5771C
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x0DD858C0
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x18EABFAA
deeper than I wished.
0x01F2FC2E

0x3796A4AC
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0xDD1A8362
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x42CB51F3
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x0F7BC02B
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x17D97657
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x9F5775CC
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x4582AB55
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x10B1FA25
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x3731A6B4

0x3796A4AC
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0x63B0D973
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x7B552E27
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x137AB4BE
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0xD8C691A2
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xBEDA790A
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0xD1B30870
up.
0xCC189E5C

0x3796A4AC
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0xCC62FEF7

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0xEF5D5035

0x3796A4AC
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0xFE54D32C

0x3796A4AC
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x84F85CEF
Or what does it mean?"
0x96AD67BB

0x3796A4AC
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0x44A916D4

0x3796A4AC
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x0F4CD623
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x252693DA
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0x87379EED

0x3796A4AC
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0xA7A298BD
perform."
0xC547B892

0x3796A4AC
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x28F486C3
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0x9DEDFA1C

0x3796A4AC
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0x635BFD5F
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0x40A30010

0x3796A4AC
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x4AFE52EC

0x3796A4AC
"Truly able."
0xA217EE98

0x3796A4AC
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0x80094E9B

0x3796A4AC
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x765D6C6A

0x3796A4AC
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0xFA210F0F
parsonic?"
0xD0D17AA4

0x3796A4AC
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0x25108D29
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x16B21CB0

0x3796A4AC
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x564380E4
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0xCA79314A
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x719E6E11

0x3796A4AC
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0x099D0233
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0x68D22DB3

0x3796A4AC
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0x2DF54216

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0x98014AA5

0x3796A4AC
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0xF5D3F085
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x4A261454
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x2227C775
immediately charm the snake.
0x5B1D9238

0x3796A4AC
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x46884303
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0x32071D85

0x3796A4AC
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0xFA4C9E5D

0x3796A4AC
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xFCF337FA
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0xEB3D2208
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x064FDFEC
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0xD8B6A2D4
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x8ADDE3F3
bargain."
0xF40D5709

0x3796A4AC
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0x21CDDE3A
sir."
0xA405201E

0x3796A4AC
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0xB7A876E1
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0x5D51D41C
question or two."  He paused.
0x0A1C9D99

0x3796A4AC
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0xB4C80F84

0x3796A4AC
Then followed this cross-examination.
0xFC205382

0x3796A4AC
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x9C7943D1
cousin?"
0xCD4EC8E1

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0x67DA664C

0x3796A4AC
"Daily."
0xA9C73430

0x3796A4AC
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0x7556063D
you are a talented creature!"
0x8C0D0AB4

0x3796A4AC
"He approved of them--yes."
0x442F87E9

0x3796A4AC
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0xF2818AD1
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0xB5046F89

0x3796A4AC
"I don't know about that."
0xE60D6E0A

0x3796A4AC
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0xAF26CA66
there to see you?"
0x8EBFC62F

0x3796A4AC
"Now and then?"
0x8B80CF64

0x3796A4AC
"Of an evening?"
0xE1EFB0FE

0x3796A4AC
"Once or twice."
0x766F6EBF

0x3796A4AC
A pause.
0x522F8A5E

0x3796A4AC
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x06A12F7C
was discovered?"
0x68C2487E

0x3796A4AC
"Five months."
0x18A3863C

0x3796A4AC
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0x22823AE8

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0x1003F8E6
window, and we by the table."
0xD789D042

0x3796A4AC
"Did he study much?"
0x7D801913

0x3796A4AC
"A good deal."
0xD6CF984A

0x3796A4AC
"What?"
0x7B236543

0x3796A4AC
"Hindostanee."
0x5CC45A54

0x3796A4AC
"And what did you do meantime?"
0x2F21699D

0x3796A4AC
"I learnt German, at first."
0x798226E8

0x3796A4AC
"Did he teach you?"
0xBF5F1960

0x3796A4AC
"He did not understand German."
0x3C428122

0x3796A4AC
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0x527AE8E3

0x3796A4AC
"A little Hindostanee."
0x374B401C

0x3796A4AC
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0x8CB64D8B

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"And his sisters also?"
0xE9BA5B7C

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"Only you?"
0x59362494

0x3796A4AC
"Only me."
0x071336A5

0x3796A4AC
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x21C4E5F0

0x3796A4AC
"No."
0xD262331D

0x3796A4AC
"He wished to teach you?"
0x617BA04A

0x3796A4AC
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0x3796A4AC
A second pause.
0x3AB0610C

0x3796A4AC
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0xAC9EB179

0x3796A4AC
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xEC08C340

0x3796A4AC
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0x9D0424CB

0x3796A4AC
"He asked me to marry him."
0x41221CDE

0x3796A4AC
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0xA5EE0B24

0x3796A4AC
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0x48825698
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0xF4214FCF

0x3796A4AC
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0xA99B94F2
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0xE95C07EB
have given you notice to quit?"
0x834932A9

0x3796A4AC
"Because I am comfortable there."
0x3D1C3D51

0x3796A4AC
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0x4F081740
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0x6506258D
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0x03F36630
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0xAFF7F601
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x8039AE9A
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0xEC6D1AB6
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0xA0A63C0E

0x3796A4AC
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0xC9AFEDF9
accord."
0x33634368

0x3796A4AC
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0x987823C4
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0x37127D6B
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0x7D525374

0x3796A4AC
"Where must I go, sir?"
0x4BCE0D9B

0x3796A4AC
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0x9B171932

0x3796A4AC
"Who is that?"
0x1420D774

0x3796A4AC
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0x79C53F96

0x3796A4AC
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x8A2A5528
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x14A205FB
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x73990EF4
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0x4E6B75DF
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x69AD7872
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x86ED0CB4
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x760CC228
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x7C1C9011
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0x132750AB

0x3796A4AC
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0xE6039578
beloved master.  He smiled.
0x0A283E6F

0x3796A4AC
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0x10FFC38C
you and Rivers?"
0x0D499AFB

0x3796A4AC
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x05335230
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0xFA4B725F
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x3AF979A9
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0xB7A0CA25
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xA077AD40
of me from your presence for ever."
0xBB3A0B4E

0x3796A4AC
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0xF1BB6B86

0x3796A4AC
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x964D90AC

0x3796A4AC
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0xFDEBE8C6
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x4E975CFA
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x4D11D7EF
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0x07672AF2

0x3796A4AC
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xE0D11AC1
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xB2518A21
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0x2FE10942

0x3796A4AC
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0x3249A291
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0x6EA1CD12
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x20DA864C
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0xF2A70663
offers them so safe a prop."
0xA2FDF7AA

0x3796A4AC
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x42D8AE77

0x3796A4AC
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0xB36D59EB

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0x0BCB4FA7
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x1E9CC6D2
helped me.
0xA05C80C9

0x3796A4AC
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0x2AA785B9

0x3796A4AC
"Do you, sir?"
0x2AF859DA

0x3796A4AC
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0xD2100336

0x3796A4AC
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0xE7AE9F18

0x3796A4AC
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0xB48EF24F

0x3796A4AC
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0xC4D5F7EC

0x3796A4AC
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0xE23223C1

0x3796A4AC
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x80E841B8

0x3796A4AC
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0xA6E3585E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0xFD6013B1

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0x63A6B7E3
on?"
0xBF2C737D

0x3796A4AC
"Yes, sir."
0xC9CCB6E0

0x3796A4AC
"Truly, Jane?"
0xC758A49A

0x3796A4AC
"Most truly, sir."
0xB57AA9FB

0x3796A4AC
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0xEB17FE21

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0x463A88B3
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0x7EFFBA84
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0xA0297DA8
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0xD77C0495

0x3796A4AC
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x220FE05E

0x3796A4AC
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0x91FC8621
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x039F0727
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0xC0E9E416
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x828A748A

0x3796A4AC
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0x3FCE6115

0x3796A4AC
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0xAD99D256
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0xD97DA890
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0xD971668F

0x3796A4AC
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0x581C3B0A
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0x16790EA9
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0x86D6FA9F
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x97AF27A2
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0x9ABE7F75
her?"
0xF5F1D290

0x3796A4AC
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x78E271D5

0x3796A4AC
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0x6FCBA670
married instantly."
0xAE724E8B

0x3796A4AC
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x7B325735

0x3796A4AC
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0xA1FA03D9
licence to get--then we marry."
0x7E75ECD5

0x3796A4AC
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0xC7511249
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0x29A0D46D
your watch."
0x161FBDE6

0x3796A4AC
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0x4E68BB0C
use for it."
0xA7C26148

0x3796A4AC
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x5EB2C75C
hungry?"
0x0A9D6ABC

0x3796A4AC
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0xDBD32337
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0xA5005157

0x3796A4AC
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x1A1FBF9E
is quite hot."
0x47662230

0x3796A4AC
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0xF8A97EED
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0xE211EBFF
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0x253FAC00

0x3796A4AC
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0xFA4559B9

0x3796A4AC
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0xB2124855

0x3796A4AC
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x1B16B258
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0xE885C831
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0xDF58C5DF
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xDD60C9B8
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x83174F6D
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xEE529A01
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xF2EE9373
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xC10AFCB8
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0xF205264B
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0xE9ED5720
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x5904C318
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x19301334
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x9F75D750
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0xB7932197
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0xC1B19673

0x3796A4AC
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0xEB41AFD6
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0xDB8ABB7F
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0x38444B2B
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0xA69C88A8
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0xE382C6A2
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0x9DA4C878
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x13EF8970
rejoining Jane.
0xC252C7BF

0x3796A4AC
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0xCD62D1F9
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0xBC795D09
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x3F77B617
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x4E5F81F4
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x109115F9
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x2AEF8307
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0x3E5C72CB
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0x2F0C13EE
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0x2EAEE0AB
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x58560870

0x3796A4AC
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0x97B37225

0x3796A4AC
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0xF01472FA
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0xD645AE9B

0x3796A4AC
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0xFCE2630E

0x3796A4AC
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0xCD2A0428
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0xE81AF27C
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0x818E42E2
that I heard what I now relate.
0x86204145

0x3796A4AC
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0xD8BB4201
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0xEE971A9B
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x7E7E6AF5
are you?'
0x024B1CF9

0x3796A4AC
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x87DFDF82
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xB0022F7D
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0xDD9472B6
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0x74A8D4FF
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0xD9C52229
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x1AE8B76E
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0x8CD0FD62
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x3D2E7BC7
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x2A35E44A
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0xB2586259

0x3796A4AC
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xDF573E7E
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xEE4FFBCB
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0x4452E771
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x264B03C7
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xA62D942B
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xA0AA6F8C
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0xB169C2B8
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0xCC1E0A8A
them in my heart.
0xF25142D9

0x3796A4AC
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0x234BCAEA
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0x96334F43
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0xDBC6FD13
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x8D81EC07
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0xE7618787
God!"
0xA4C38B1B

0x3796A4AC
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0x57FE339C
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x13C901FE
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x415B5E7C

0x3796A4AC
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0x9F1C0A69
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0x9FB52DAA
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0x1FAC7DA9

0x3796A4AC
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x946885A4
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0xDE82814B
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0xA0FCA7C0
entered the wood, and wended homeward.

0x3796A4AC
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x58BDDE3E

0x3796A4AC

0x3796A4AC
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0x39614827
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x6DBD3DF1
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x2BF04C04
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0x8E9A96EA

0x3796A4AC
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xFC87E2B0
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x39AE999E
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0xC9AA7ECC
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x4D657F2D
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x4708428E
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0xFE583B65
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x9B999C17
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xFDD72F64
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x663FEFB1
again over the roast, said only--
0xB612E34C

0x3796A4AC
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0xCF7BFDAD

0x3796A4AC
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x6007704D
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x9A2950B3
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xE1C2C1FF

0x3796A4AC
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x2E387200
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0xD4F763E6
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0xB42FECA9
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0xFA3A46FF
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x87AAE534
politely pulled his forelock.
0xB272B4D1

0x3796A4AC
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0xC70D1134
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x63563BB7
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xA37A3A36
caught the words--
0xB8E04784

0x3796A4AC
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x1A63CC08
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x4DFB8A78
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0xC7B881AA

0x3796A4AC
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xE82CEE9B
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x60EAEFF9
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x20DFC701
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xDB33C7D2

0x3796A4AC
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0x84D205C0
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x9C0115D2
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x1DB13F3A
grave or mine."
0x0B33DE87

0x3796A4AC
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0xB1DE9AE2
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0xDD94C392
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0x5E1D9742
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xE5006031
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x8EFA6755
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x62D181D5
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0xD1416984

0x3796A4AC
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x84323CBE
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0x7BFAE701
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xDD7E7FDF
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x4C35A41B
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x941AB167
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x25B3A6B9
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0xF1B15FB7
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0xC46BD701
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0xB127EEDB
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0xB4342B2D
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x2FFB943A
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x8862E2CF
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xF428BE82
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x5683EE16
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x8365ADE2
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0xA7BED2E9
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x8406FEF4
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0x72BB96C6

0x3796A4AC
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x6F34436E
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xB75007C4
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0xD61EA9BF

0x3796A4AC
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x190B41D9
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x696DFCBA
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x8164E55C
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0x52A0B6D6
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x55B09092
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0xD3174711
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xD50E4C3C
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xFE7854F2
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x591439F0
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0xBFC60860
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x053D6D86
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0xF6A56C5E
concord is the result.
0x8A15504D

0x3796A4AC
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x992BF195
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x73CEBB36
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x3D61F6D8
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0x649F7172
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0xEF837FB1
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xA1FB51CC
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x9A6A48B1
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0x03E12DC6
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0x83E0409C
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x99E01DC6
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xFCD2535B
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x72EE3498
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x0AD35C73
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x824350FA
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0xA7DBE79D

0x3796A4AC
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x562FD066
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0x82233728
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0xB86DE705

0x3796A4AC
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0xEE798D80

0x3796A4AC
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0xF002FC3D

0x3796A4AC
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0x553DEA92

0x3796A4AC
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xD6680F73
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0x04CFCC5A
sure of it.
0x075780CF

0x3796A4AC
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x0D8A79C3
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x52B1B13C
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x518C933B
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x1AB4BF5B
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0x9FC79353
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0x08D30ADA
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x80FB935B
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x4E6AF2FE

0x3796A4AC
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x03E00CBD
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x46BB729C
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x5B4AD346
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x0139DCB2
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x9A9B0306
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0xD91B5E5E
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x54F4D4B7

0x3796A4AC
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x06006A80
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x7FCC55EF
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0xA0B9E1AE
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x5D06BCA1
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x36238B6C
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0xF512D87B
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0xA1B4C2E6
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x3254646A
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x2D05576F
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0x53F5BCAF
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x37EE0757
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x3CD5EEE6
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x396D0638
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0x8C7358F6
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x1F4B2154

0x3796A4AC
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x12B5B15B
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0xE8CCAFD5
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x5EBF18D3
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x7BA2A894
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xBDA12710
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0x6F41C62F
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x6A4B8D61
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0xEC0336CC
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x7DB8FA2D
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0xC0E756F5

0x3796A4AC
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x530F4ECC
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0x7EEDC522
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
0x6C8C988F

0x3796A4AC
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x6AACBB92
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x1192FC1E
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0xB6A2E059
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x8D49BC10
people in all walks of life.
0x1C54C608

0x3796A4AC
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0x8BCC1316
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0xC9474422
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0xFB24AB5B
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0x43E30292
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0xD49FB8A6
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Literary Archive Foundation
0x3F415D93

0x3796A4AC
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0x091AE794
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0x6531E527
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0x3ED851C5
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0xA7EC7020
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0xE835AAF7
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0x1CB7EAE3
status with the IRS.
0x13A90326

0x3796A4AC
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0x091A5B3F
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0x6C39C87A
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0xF504B204
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0x6862C18B
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0x7AFEAC62
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
0x7DBD4468

0x29502CE8
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
0x09577EB1

0x3796A4AC
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
0xCAC50C8D
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0x8C2EB5CC
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0x33624E7F
approach us with offers to donate.
0xFD81E26C

0x3796A4AC
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
0xD6898253
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
0x378BD1F7
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
0x62735157
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0x62D05ADD

0xCDEFE5D7
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0x7DEFEF77

0x3796A4AC
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0x88950260
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0x0A789938
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
0x7A63EF8C
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
