PREFACE
0xA00552CC

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x7A3650E7
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x1A03C2B4
miscellaneous remark.
0x3F43C2AA

0xB04A0E33
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0xDE29EE5A

0xB04A0E33
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0xF5448834
few pretensions.
0x99241A5B

0xB04A0E33
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x9919EB97
obscure aspirant.
0xAEA961F3

0xB04A0E33
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x221AEE35
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x481EE6B9
Author.
0xAAF8356E

0xB04A0E33
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0xED3008EE
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x67BE9058
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xB6FD4D4F
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x7368BBB0
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x93EB2A77
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0xA96FAC14

0xB04A0E33
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x9E3B7226
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0x60E1412D
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x4C2D581D
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x12B14632
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0xB6B5A3C5
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x49C28A45
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0xB8A45E30
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0xFF5895C9

0xB04A0E33
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0xBE16DF69
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x8F8B2083
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x8D61D9D8
Thorns.
0x328CA158

0xB04A0E33
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0x2E887868
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0xF372DDF7
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x224D358D
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xBA3F0F52
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0x80FFF41D
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xB00E53A9
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x007BA1D7

0xB04A0E33
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x4AB92A72
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x5DACC027
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xDD73DC20
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x6A02BE58
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0xE69D4AFF
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x37178B89

0xB04A0E33
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x7C2C063E
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x1F525A9B
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xC63A2AC8
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x2B97DA8B

0xB04A0E33
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0xAB0D2628
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x1F88582D
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x499A8424
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x856CF13D
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x5E96C4F3
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x6B48DAAA
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0xAD74AE58
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x857E2E52
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0xC24C0515
Rimoth-Gilead.
0x42BB6433

0xB04A0E33
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x5156AEC9
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x74F2685E
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xFB6FCCDD
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xAB517B7A
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x4B4D3E31
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0xCBAE218A
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0xCF3F4C92
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x63BB7C1C
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x5495E971
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x1027CD56
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0x4BC95AF8
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0xA2228A4C
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x5283E9F4
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0x3D080296
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0x10DA5D59

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x57A44335
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x410B771F
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0xBD63AF53
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xBEC52BD1
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0xFA5D9E5B
denied where it is justly due.
0x918BAE68

0xB04A0E33
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0x56ED7046
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0xB40C08DF

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0xAB6EF46C
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x64FC30D0
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0xD98FB226
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0x59A3C951
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xC03E4798

0xB04A0E33
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0x7CE9730C
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x39CEE8B7
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xCA92611E
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0xC1687698
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0x9393DE23

0xB04A0E33
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x4CA207CE
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0x8B31667A
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x4B442FC6
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x0A997DA3
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x6E3BC774
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xB81D9BCD
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x03C9DA2E
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x992C1210
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x6CE1E850
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x27755BCB
little children."
0x9494708A

0xB04A0E33
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x6BB7E806

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0xF029B628
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0x7352C1D7
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0xA8378869

0xB04A0E33
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x5AE8D671
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xD3184DB8
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0xD97315D2
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0xF0422A38
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0x1B773FE9
retirement.
0xF7271F3E

0xB04A0E33
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x0478AB2F
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0xACB9F86C
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xD530A90D
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0x984C8993
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x15EE3F5F
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x3B4E91D0
lamentable blast.
0x53404AE0

0xB04A0E33
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x9373764D
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x9AAC1AC6
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x95BB0EDF
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x93ADBF1D
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0xC63D40E0
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x8E67EE8E
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0x22FEE6FE

0xB04A0E33
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x5A31BDFF
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x37DB928D
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0x4D182683
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x40330B84

0xB04A0E33
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0x0DB5274B
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x0B674EAF
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x65CD87B4
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x042FCD44
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0xAAC90402
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x7050E6B0
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0xA4EF323C
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x3B042C51
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0xB7DC7842
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x2F1E110A
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0xD7F42BCF
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x94EE32DE
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x22018788

0xB04A0E33
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x54471DDD
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x8A306F1C
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x11DD2585
hour of eventide.
0x1A6306E6

0xB04A0E33
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0x936033CD

0xB04A0E33
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x84DFF2D4
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0xFE623F56

0xB04A0E33
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x89BB8ADE
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x9A9DD76F

0xB04A0E33
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0xAB3B7897
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x52BCDC1E
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x6623369E
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x90E41F77
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0xBF1D46BF
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x76C69300
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xCDA37CCE
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0xD18F692C
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x27AAC478

0xB04A0E33
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x0FFADDED
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x2DFCF9C1
room door opened.
0x5F862C65

0xB04A0E33
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0x78EF5265
found the room apparently empty.
0xCAE5AA64

0xB04A0E33
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x3B48C053
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x43A68D34
animal!"
0x45CEA40F

0xB04A0E33
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0xBDCDD2E3
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0xACFDB4D1
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x9F19C9AF
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x36D2FF49

0xB04A0E33
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x9125A930

0xB04A0E33
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x34DDBD43
forth by the said Jack.
0x4F862445

0xB04A0E33
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x4CFAD40C

0xB04A0E33
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xFC94FCEC
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x075A16B4
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xC23DF2D3

0xB04A0E33
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0x6FFFE77A
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x06FCB70A
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0x5BBBB018
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0xEE19E4B3
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x413EFAF4
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x45B4122F
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x897D5E4C
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x7AFEECA8
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x03611366
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xED6BD959
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x1E0F5FCE
home.
0x94B5988F

0xB04A0E33
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x7A6FF4F3
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0x3751B797
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0x8D5B1FCC
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x7A32BEB8
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x97B5AB2D
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0x7569ECC7
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xFAE8E4D2
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x17221E8E
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x84290579
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0xEDC2776B
her back.
0x68D90B8A

0xB04A0E33
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x2AE01E00
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0x06A26952
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x1A7012E2
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0xDE5DCA2B
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x0906CC1A
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x4501C216
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x0EE4445C
chair.
0xF693156F

0xB04A0E33
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0xA61E32CA
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x1C71DEF8
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x1592032D

0xB04A0E33
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0xAC4DFF03
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0xF76E905D
insult.
0x1C7BC7EB

0xB04A0E33
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0x937AE0EB

0xB04A0E33
"I was reading."
0xCCDC1CEA

0xB04A0E33
"Show the book."
0x0DFA0B4D

0xB04A0E33
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.

0xB04A0E33
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x0C59C6F4
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xA4E0FA6D
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0x04CE4E0F
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0x87AF415F
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0x3221EDCA
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0xD32E631B
the mirror and the windows."
0xED884B3E

0xB04A0E33
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0x332C4113
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x30E5734D
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x4F4690C5
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x12800579
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0x6B0641CC
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x86378512

0xB04A0E33
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x65D1608C
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x62D4CAF8

0xB04A0E33
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x7DD467B9
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x62121225
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0xC6E85E99

0xB04A0E33
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x8DC055AC
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0x84F1C7E5

0xB04A0E33
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0x2F0474C1
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x91E0CE13
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x3C50DEEA
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0xB8193802
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x78ED4069
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0xEDC4BC36
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x5C0B5E2B
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0x251B6DBE
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x1863AA5B

0xB04A0E33
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0xBC309356

0xB04A0E33
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0xBA124481

0xB04A0E33
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x46B09EF1

0xB04A0E33
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x6304F19F
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

CHAPTER II
0x8EAA8891

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0x12DCE3B2
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x93DEF478
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x5B32DEDB
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x2C64EDE7
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x639286EF
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x580CBCE6

0xB04A0E33
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x0172F3DC

0xB04A0E33
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x3411C226
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x73B49213
young master."
0x11E3E4BF

0xB04A0E33
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0xFF7BBCE4

0xB04A0E33
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0xCCF46C6A
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0xE6F8AF9D

0xB04A0E33
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x495404E2
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xDC06ED7C
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x0C0322E8

0xB04A0E33
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0xD39EABE3
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x195D72CD

0xB04A0E33
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x5A6D152A
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0xDC32FC96
little of the excitement out of me.
0x64727E1B

0xB04A0E33
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x5F823DF4

0xB04A0E33
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x1E285167

0xB04A0E33
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0xB71985EC
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0x5EDDFEC6
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0x45803DAE
incredulous of my sanity.
0xE2B2DAA8

0xB04A0E33
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x41E38EEA

0xB04A0E33
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x9AEDED08
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0xBE8D0F00
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0xB7AB4C95

0xB04A0E33
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0xDC8BD874
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xB267D1E4
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x34F96979

0xB04A0E33
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0x999BA1B2
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0x5D71E124
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0xBB7D8A9A
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x7E21DFB1

0xB04A0E33
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x27590EF7
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0xBBBFFD8A
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0xC29735A2
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x19E393AD
them."
0x4DE5328F

0xB04A0E33
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x7C6DE45E
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x76770DC4
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0xC568D730
away, I am sure."
0xD067E5A8

0xB04A0E33
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x2F288988
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xDF5C4A40
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x14102E4D
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0x9007FECA
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x75F94260
fetch you away."
0x729136BD

0xB04A0E33
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0xDFB09020

0xB04A0E33
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0xB4415237
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0xCCDEEDBD
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x378E95EE
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x6D5263DA
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xE3AD7DC6
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x0EF6D4E1
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0xBD159229
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0xA4B09F90
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xD0187838
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0xF897D267
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xDDA513BF
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0x61F3220A
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x5BB0D96F
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0xFFA4F92A
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x30E15F40
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x2A3BDB6C

0xB04A0E33
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0xDBC39FF9
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x6D3F4697
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0x6D599117
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x96486C23
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x4671DE55
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x66DC8D6B
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x8B580717
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0xEAA0D3B0
in spite of its grandeur.
0xE2D34B5A

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x9B064D6F
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x4FA838A5
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0xDEB549E4
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xCCAA408A

0xB04A0E33
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x47D369DE
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0xE9FA7EBC
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xDEBCF0E6
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0xDA966F34
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xA2CF884B
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xCAA1490A
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x099A7C92
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x57338C0F
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0x48C41BDA
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x8AEA6015
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0x50F72BBF
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x0D7B7154
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0xCB80F67F
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0xE5738AD0
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0xBB5D1D83
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0xFD8364D3

0xB04A0E33
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0xD0D449EF
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x7B429530
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0x7EEC82A6
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x6E40FCAB

0xB04A0E33
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0x2D5B89B1
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x701922CD
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x75FD55B1
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x1258D25E
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x2D685375
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0xFC9C9F98
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0xDBB3AF23
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x07EC97E2
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x730F6878
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x40A890EC
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0xD7F41326
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0xB7B57D83
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x6FC6D6F7
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0xE0F9E7D0
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x4255A4AD
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x8B1FA5F9
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x5C5453A5
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x753B589E
night.
0xE63026C7

0xB04A0E33
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0xBD14118C
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x0FE4C4C2
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0xB58BEE8E
general opprobrium.
0x43F4BF01

0xB04A0E33
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0xDADFE1B0
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x40F32875
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0xC66AE3AA
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x99AE2F98
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xDA0F8A25

0xB04A0E33
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0xC671D497
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0x251D36F6
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0xAAE977BF
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0x63F12836
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xB98B3C47

0xB04A0E33
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0x313381B2
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xECEED964
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xC83F3765
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x3E9F9107
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0xFC1C6AF8
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x98EC66B0
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x8ADC0C5E
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x5B8D9BA9
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x0FC4A9DB
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0xEB94319D
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x75398244
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0xDDE2A43A
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xBA139382

0xB04A0E33
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x83461029
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x8FFB87F7
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x7982C57C
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x6F8B6E94
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0xE768627C
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0xCBD0F8F9
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x0E7D456B
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0x6D165173
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0xD41517EC
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x55874FD7
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x39A43337
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xA84D3799
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0xBF4CD633
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x7DC2C3C2
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0xAE0FEAB7
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x56DFA83C
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0xE5735244
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x3204D9B4
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x46C9CED5
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xF2A19471
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x8E9C0A79
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x7ED9A39A

0xB04A0E33
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0xAAB439B5
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0xB46C1450
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0x72928085
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x2857DF72
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x9F4EEBB4
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x79192BA5
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x3EAB238B
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x7E5AA0CE
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x0FA5EF2F
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xF9EBB0A2
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0xA1211038
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x787C7476
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0xBC392A5D
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0xD7CDD5AA
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0xDCCC284D
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x301E2ED0
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xCFDEE0B9
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x1F215E7F
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x8B7BC693
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x6B1384A1
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x71449A82
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0x6517C2D0
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x22A8BD8A
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0x89CD4BB7
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x6D2C225F
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0x777B19A5
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x5B388219
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x3178EBD4
Abbot entered.
0xB9B59176

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x93DC6AB5

0xB04A0E33
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0xA4F7BA67

0xB04A0E33
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0x000C1905

0xB04A0E33
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0x491833F8
Bessie.
0x48DDD35B

0xB04A0E33
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x449CD978
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x22EDEBB4

0xB04A0E33
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x5171EDD6
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x7E2F5EBE
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0xA429D922

0xB04A0E33
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xAF2AB6CE
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x2AD99BEF
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0xFFDF581C
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0xA2E14FFF

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0x0FA17020

0xB04A0E33
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0xC2C210A5
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0xA64296EB
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x142FB342
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x0287EDA4
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x1DFFD8B7
then."
0x89F24DE4

0xB04A0E33
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xBA3EA1BF
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x6F1DD0F7

0xB04A0E33
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0x6AC3C245
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0x66E47F06
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0xE16D2F89
duplicity.
0xC92ECCD6

0xB04A0E33
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x3C466A9C
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x839FABBA
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0xEDFC9E61
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0x2B1E49AC

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0x85F32F4A
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0xA1A4C9F3
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x67AA4929
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x7A0E1E48
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0xD9ED5CE8
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0xB95E0ABD
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x4E532784
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0x96A50CBD
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xE4096CFA

0xB04A0E33
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x2AD73967
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0x3B5212D6
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x6DB37F90
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x9655ED3C
pillow, leaning over me.
0x38181EFA

0xB04A0E33
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xCBECBF9D
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x5653A5E6
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x4E46AE9C
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0xB8E5AA9C
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0xBAD0F1B7
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x8BC63161
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x39C0EBA2
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x36D284A4

0xB04A0E33
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xEF7C56D9

0xB04A0E33
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0xDE528768
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0xEDB90056
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xF3B2A441
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x1FAB2AE4
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0xCB6C33EF
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x14DC4CF5
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0xCB894D1F
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0xAD06CB03

0xB04A0E33
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x914564FE

0xB04A0E33
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x577014B6
rough.  "I will try."
0x7A93D902

0xB04A0E33
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x310A6599

0xB04A0E33
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0x6FA8055C

0xB04A0E33
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x786DCCD0
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x62D017E0

0xB04A0E33
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0xA296B484

0xB04A0E33
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0xA60C0AAF

0xB04A0E33
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x7F34ACB0
soon, no doubt."
0xCEAE5629

0xB04A0E33
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0x3AC29912
say--
0xF61DC4E7

0xB04A0E33
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0x89413970
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0xAD43E5E6
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x958633F3
rather too hard."
0xD8895D68

0xB04A0E33
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0xF5BBC1D4
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x463FC2F9
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0x9CAD4B55
the main subject discussed.
0xAE431629

0xB04A0E33
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x1B7ECA3A
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0x78B4FACF
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x09C5AA35

0xB04A0E33
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0xF84D73E4
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0xF38D70D9
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0x6C5C0993

0xB04A0E33
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0x05206866
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x9D89E244
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0x6B413C5E
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0xB4F1D322
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x62CDEDA7
bad propensities.
0x3AB55F45

0xB04A0E33
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x82277F02
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0xEC641E10
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0x93A8A180
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x74438C52
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0xEB58BDF2
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x98C65F66
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x71DDBA6A
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0x85B733DB
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x6B964112
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xCE6D73F4
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xDC899151
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x01C9E77C
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xEFE03AF1

0xB04A0E33
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0x1D2DD089
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0xEA295113
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x5FBBB8AD
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0xACFB3BF5
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0xE0985303
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x5AC96ADC
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0xF2936E53
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x2B2098D7
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0x362CAADA
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xC97916D4
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x6AC5956D
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x7C8B8488
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0xD9B2C7B7
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x3F2D30F2
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x803B6A7D
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0xE258D4E6
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x8B99203E
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x01EB34EC
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x5D4CC2F0
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0xA375F260
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x89CF1A39
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xEF87FE9F
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x54A9261F
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0xB0BDDB55
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0xE92ADDC3
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x8C0999CA
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0x93B103E8
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0xCD925780
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0xDAC97A5D
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x9BA41A4C
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xE5B22559
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0xEB9C5B6D
untasted tart.
0x8290B67E

0xB04A0E33
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x9CD8A54E
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0x572D85B1
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0xBE683F76
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0xFF0EED40

0xB04A0E33
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x8CFB2255
      A long time ago."
0x4CBCEC17

0xB04A0E33
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x5FBE2999
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x6D807BEE
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x1D655417
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x6679563A
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0x12E2A704
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0xC5C21757
one.
0xEC7D402C

0xB04A0E33
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0xD531E047
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x2B22450F
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0xF2574022
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0xA494760C

0xB04A0E33
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0x212D42E1
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0x2C34C214
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x97E9C81A
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0xF253B0DE

0xB04A0E33
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x2BCC3BFD
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0xE2DBBE9D
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xA905DB70
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0x11126CDA

0xB04A0E33
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x4D5EF66D
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x062E5C2A
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x8B4C2BD8
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0xBDF29924

0xB04A0E33
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x84DBE256
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x446C1856
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0xEF841C2B
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0xF1658A78

0xB04A0E33
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0xA11C1208
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0xDB0DD200
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x837D98B3
Lloyd came again.
0x45B2C15F

0xB04A0E33
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x8F7D3FF3
how is she?"
0x66719C4D

0xB04A0E33
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0xF18F30CC

0xB04A0E33
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x20DD9F3F
is Jane, is it not?"
0xAD9A04E8

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x1977CC3B

0xB04A0E33
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x402EC1F3
Have you any pain?"
0x887C264C

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0xB04A0E33
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x2A8D24A5
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0xEFA3EA1C

0xB04A0E33
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x57EE718D

0xB04A0E33
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x4FEFA8FF
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x889666A7
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0x0085620E

0xB04A0E33
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x150A7D7F

0xB04A0E33
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x5745150F
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x4B1E2F3B
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0xE2B312A3
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xD103D841
leisure, he said--
0x789BD749

0xB04A0E33
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0xF831636D

0xB04A0E33
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x8C4E5D38

0xB04A0E33
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x2B02B604
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x157EDBFA

0xB04A0E33
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0xDF05B5E9
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0xC8257D49
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xCAB27A4A

0xB04A0E33
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x36279945
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0x4902FA36
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0xCE968CD5

0xB04A0E33
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0x7FF5798E
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x30A62D7B

0xB04A0E33
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x04659F35
Bessie was gone.
0xF7594214

0xB04A0E33
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0xBE6F448E

0xB04A0E33
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0x5121AF4F

0xB04A0E33
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0xB7CD496D

0xB04A0E33
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x12DBB2C4
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x232A4719
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x491F2D93
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x4F84B0C6

0xB04A0E33
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0x3D2B8085
daylight?"
0x143B39F3

0xB04A0E33
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x608507D2
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0xDB7B82D7

0xB04A0E33
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0x8EB285D7

0xB04A0E33
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0x825FCB8D
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0xFE3A2AF6
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0x97D34892
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0xE2063136
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x8DCFA226
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0xD9F3BE60
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x7F0A50F6

0xB04A0E33
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0x0D9A0BF9

0xB04A0E33
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0xC44B8716

0xB04A0E33
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x0A75D54F

0xB04A0E33
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x28A6E61D

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0x4A69B135

0xB04A0E33
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0x6C9E5F34
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0x0BE4CA83

0xB04A0E33
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x663BF7E7
than a servant."
0x8F681BF9

0xB04A0E33
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0x08DE0726

0xB04A0E33
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0xF814086B
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0xA33D9021

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x466CC4EC

0xB04A0E33
"I think not, sir."
0x4D50B844

0xB04A0E33
"None belonging to your father?"
0x96C4E0EB

0xB04A0E33
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xDA789524
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0xDBBDA78C
them."
0x4DE5328F

0xB04A0E33
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x98F69E4E

0xB04A0E33
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x3BC7E9B7
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0x69F7947E
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0xCD5D21D0
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0xB7DF7E40
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x8A5ABC4C

0xB04A0E33
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x97331362

0xB04A0E33
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x0D9F7632

0xB04A0E33
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x788BCCB1
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0xA1B5D8D5
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0xDB5A4472
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0xD31A1754
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0x72B5FDFA
the price of caste.
0x04428A38

0xB04A0E33
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x83C292B1

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0x6EED0F55
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x7DDD2DA2

0xB04A0E33
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x02AF3923

0xB04A0E33
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x6AD3F710
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xA8CCFE59
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x9F5202D5
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x3CCB24BC
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x6C52F219
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xB2D6E166
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xBB1EA484
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0xA70912B0
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xCE005EE7
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x31517B72
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x81F87771
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0xDB5BB7CC
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x9C59A8C5
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0x690F81B9

0xB04A0E33
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x14A4F734
musings.
0x542AE2EB

0xB04A0E33
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0xD016A30C
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x6BBD3E24
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x815354C3

0xB04A0E33
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x8B588680
the gravel-walk.
0x6A9191D9

0xB04A0E33
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xC2C5575E
to her before I go."
0x6133D517

0xB04A0E33
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0xD3ADD330
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0x96AF5920
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x3895BA3B
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xE629BD56
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0xF7298374
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x6A42864D
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0xF12D49A1
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x62AE5A04
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x7F1D05DB
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x9086291A

0xB04A0E33
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0x4154A7F7
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0x4D8CB473
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x52D0BA7D
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x4880DD6D
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x7E56C273
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x568E297F
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0xD259DAF2
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x8E9CE325
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0xF4189327
of each other.
0x57C0D898

0xB04A0E33
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0xA10B783C
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0xAEB731EA

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0xE8D8457B
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0xB796764F
little toad as that."
0x9B662332

0xB04A0E33
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0xDC8C0B0E
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x5E522471

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0x7090C518
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x51036ADD
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x144EBE1C
rabbit for supper."
0x73FC749D

0xB04A0E33
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
0x7A1A9760

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER IV
0x301B5A2E

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0xF1EFA480
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x4C5D4CAF
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xD01E299A
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x2F18E4E4
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0xEC872C4A
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0x11F8286C
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0xE628DFDB
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0x10FD08E0
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0xF69D7BE4
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0xB99FD0ED
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0xF1947DA7
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x96D1C4C6
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x3348EBE9
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0xEC3140B5
and rooted aversion.
0x95065789

0xB04A0E33
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0x9F6C429E
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0x7DE30078
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0xCB17CAB3
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x2C0EB057
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x19987CEF
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0xA46E85D9
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0x91EC59D1
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x1B2C696E
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0x2C085CBC
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x162CEF22
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xD4753D55
was stopped rather harshly--
0x7821F080

0xB04A0E33
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0xE04D3DC5
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x96F16B58
should associate with her."
0x735F1747

0xB04A0E33
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0xEFFF5556
deliberating on my words--
0x5172BD54

0xB04A0E33
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x0F77980E

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x8FE207E7
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x9631E575
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x8E8A8D95
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0x7CC9592B
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x160CA4AF

0xB04A0E33
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x408BA3D2
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x8FDB10C1
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0xC30DE582
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x9E1AA2F1

0xB04A0E33
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xA2ECBCFF
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0xAEC5685B
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0x69A2026C
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0xEACD3C77

0xB04A0E33
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x2075225E
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0x7C0D2993
wish me dead."
0x1D161CA9

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0xC008C137
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0x4E037AF3
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x9185BF4D
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0xD2D3EC35
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x01D683A3
in my breast.
0x06C43D4C

0xB04A0E33
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x7532EB4D
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0xEB0E67B7
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0x8CBBFF1C
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0xBB83BA2B
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xDC9CD51D
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xEA19BC8C
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0xC41AD4F9
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x5F4CFB9F
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0xD30B81D4
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xC507C0E7
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x24D6675A
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x90F10439
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0x944F7302
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x0C2D2718
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x5AF6916E
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xA548ADF8
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0xBDB55718
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x4FF1C07C
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x4F006A72
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x4E65E9C4
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0xC44C8A35
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x2CFB475D
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x08BF23E3
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0xC2A05037
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x6FEE76C4
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x3A4BB56F
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x98CF69D0
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0x1302597C
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0xB2C008AF
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0xECC4A433
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xD0436D73
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0xC9587768
to be happy likewise.
0x5E1AD42E

0xB04A0E33
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x79CFAA95
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x933BBEB5
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x28DCC6AA
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x12CF4717
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x5C8720E5
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x1F3AF3D0
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0xA5D6BB6E
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x7D80DF3C
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x082937AD
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xB230C5A4
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x7D1E5B22
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xD39FE791
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x09D7DD33
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0x65AC4543
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x63FD05D6
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0xFEC24F3F
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x8FCB0388
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x320AC973
Gateshead Hall.
0xEE272FF5

0xB04A0E33
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0x2E2F1583
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0xCCFE5276
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0xBB6776C5
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x531197DC
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0xAB2520D4
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0xDB741B7D
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0xCD28AEC3
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x3C4A9944
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0x6D1BF92E
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x58E05548
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0xE355ACC5
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x120F3742
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0x4A7D536E
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x9D8E01EA
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0x9C6B2876
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0x2D6C8FC9
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0xBD9BAB08
accuracy.
0x767292BA

0xB04A0E33
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x8F02C0CD
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0xDCCD0637
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x1E5ECE16
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x9B57AEDD
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x8E0254BB
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x9245B8DD
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x2BF44AA3
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xCA7C78BB
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0xB4A67880
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x93EB5951
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x4CA169B8
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x3524ECD2
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x0121C842
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xDDC56D93
frost.
0xD0756497

0xB04A0E33
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0xADF2720C
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x7CF1D318
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0x0B4A2B31
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xFB8852BA
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0xCE304C94
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0xC66C697D
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0xB049FC97
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x09E82D0F
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x26D6E5BB
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0x37F6D6EC
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x768DCF24
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x86A1324A
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xE0F34486
nursery.
0xE338F587

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x157F78A5
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x45432C88
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0xA00B1973
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x3AE88ABB
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x52CF23EB

0xB04A0E33
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x3BB697BA

0xB04A0E33
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x4941EB19
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0xB008F1F3
window for?"
0x924B5DE5

0xB04A0E33
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0xF0496B8D
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xA7AA92BA
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x0ED5F695
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x7B65CFD5
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x0644D13B
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0xB9BB3001

0xB04A0E33
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0xF8877296
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0x5427BC31
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x9A549357
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x0EE02798
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x752F97E8
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0xA42AC6FD

0xB04A0E33
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xDFC99190
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x2DF67E65
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x2D0619D6
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x5F1AD1CF
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x853763C3
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x08880121

0xB04A0E33
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x05766890
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x0C454BA3
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0xBF93C92B
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0xD172A6BF
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0xD5EFAC23
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x6A60C643
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x2DE8E3E1
by way of capital.
0x8EF96657

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0xD80FFBD6
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0xA2449C00
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x3CE7791D
you."
0x2632D859

0xB04A0E33
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0xA7A85C4B
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x91BF892C
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0xCE8C8BDB
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x75225EE0

0xB04A0E33
"Ten years."
0xDD3AA3A0

0xB04A0E33
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x1E445E2B
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x01B4B793

0xB04A0E33
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0xB920988A

0xB04A0E33
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0xCF4FA5DF
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0x953F4FE5
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0x29D14677

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x5D3CD8DB

0xB04A0E33
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x76A65D74
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x5BF34502
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x11E971F6
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xC308E34A

0xB04A0E33
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x49949303
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x4DFB38A5
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x815377AA

0xB04A0E33
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x8DA96C7D
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x8DB2A3B4
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!

0xB04A0E33
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x0C156C13
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x7A70127C

0xB04A0E33
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x126F1140

0xB04A0E33
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x74E52538

0xB04A0E33
"A pit full of fire."
0x72ACA076

0xB04A0E33
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0xCF96FF39
ever?"
0x8C0341D6

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0xB04A0E33
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x8F082173

0xB04A0E33
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0xB0D50723
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xD80AD3E3

0xB04A0E33
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xBC09B66C
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x1193A16D
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x4FB8E2A4
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x7DAA6094

0xB04A0E33
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x5E4E0BA9
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0x97872C81
enough away.
0x2B425C51

0xB04A0E33
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0xB8B56670
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x52839B33

0xB04A0E33
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0xE8F87330
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0xFB10757F

0xB04A0E33
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0xC59AF1BE

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Do you read your Bible?"
0xF1293085

0xB04A0E33
"Sometimes."
0x38974647

0xB04A0E33
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x9AA6DFCC

0xB04A0E33
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xD80E13FD
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0x475C9B9D
and Jonah."
0xEC42364A

0xB04A0E33
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x538038F7

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0xB04A0E33
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x14004DA9
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x5342F291
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x78E99849
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x820FD614
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x5BD67D92
piety."
0xC0FE94CC

0xB04A0E33
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x211C0AA4

0xB04A0E33
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0xF2BC03D3
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0xFC3FC39A
give you a heart of flesh."
0xC718BFD0

0xB04A0E33
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x2FE2CCD1
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0xC952FCD3
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0x7105A4EC
conversation herself.
0xF2C02E26

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x3A8FFC65
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0xC4AE39E0
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0xAA26A50A
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xD7000D2E
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x2602BBFF
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xBE1826AF
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xE92F9EAC

0xB04A0E33
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0xD2A59F4D
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x6E69CAF1
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0x98AEE902
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xADE857E9
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0x5FF882AA
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0xBC86E9E1
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0xEE25DAAF
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x55C239A9
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0x96F88970
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xE6AA7E1A

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x19813B43
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x2470E56C

0xB04A0E33
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0x3DD55C3D
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0xCBC4B942
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0xAE70783D
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0xA3248872

0xB04A0E33
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xA6083223
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x1871C7BA
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x5DD3CC45
Lowood."
0x0DBD087F

0xB04A0E33
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x420FBA70
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0xEE7CD70D
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0xB9C719FD
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0xCAB68CAA
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xF21AACC2
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0x16E3009D
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0xA32001CC
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x1F833E78
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0xBD2EB511
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0xC7B16FB0
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0xE3A864D0
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0xF3ACB400

0xB04A0E33
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x6C6EEB9D
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xF2AC73B9
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x44607EB8
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0xDABFEEF7

0xB04A0E33
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0x156689AD
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xA244229F
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0xC8C0E3E5
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0x2E48B891
inhabitants."
0x3399C0D9

0xB04A0E33
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x0AAA6CAD
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0xC9DA834E
and prospects?"
0x55910809

0xB04A0E33
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x82009B3E
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0xC5A2FB6F
of her election."
0xB7699EAF

0xB04A0E33
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x7AD94976
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x60BA6B31
becoming too irksome."
0x849B8205

0xB04A0E33
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0x6019F2CC
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0xABDF94CE
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x3E51796B
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0xBCB953D7
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x851F1DA9

0xB04A0E33
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0xE386A8CD
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x7DFF540C

0xB04A0E33
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0xBA89F063
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x9F4F71FE
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0xF0D02CB5
falsehood and deceit.'"
0xBCE578AE

0xB04A0E33
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0xD8CEF936
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xC42F9CE5

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0xDA56F095
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x83497DD4
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x5450F3FD
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0x6221C954
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x1FB3B427
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x0D4E067C
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x0DF99F73
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x6F032C85
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0xC5DD3D46
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0xECB8197A
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x7B4B1E1B
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x9EBDEC0C
handsome attire.
0xA6B506C4

0xB04A0E33
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xA50123D1
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x424BDCAC
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0xDF15808A
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x01E3F468
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x1AFEE961
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x8E02537F
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x7CEEEA87
fomented now within me.
0x0697EFD2

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x237C6389
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x9D219096

0xB04A0E33
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x08B387DF
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0xE8366457
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0xA6219160
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0x7D0803FC
to her.
0xC15E64EF

0xB04A0E33
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x7DE0E349
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x2EE10A60
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x96395D3C

0xB04A0E33
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0xA420B736
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x9C815F3F
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x63C892D9
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x4D11ABA4

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x7D77057C
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0x63301613

0xB04A0E33
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xD9F2509C
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x3B198ABC
used to a child.
0x8D6C3F40

0xB04A0E33
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x140E68E9
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x09F728BE

0xB04A0E33
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x7F76FCEE
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x7B4C6A50
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x4E1AE73C
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x20EFC1AC
miserable cruelty."
0xA8703716

0xB04A0E33
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x5D1F7AB4

0xB04A0E33
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x37B6458E
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x76275148
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0xA65A7E13
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xE30D2D5D
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x70824B4C
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x2230B4D9
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0xB94ED6E4
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0x873ABAAA
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0xDEC52503
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x253726C8

0xB04A0E33
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0x23FD0B7C

0xB04A0E33
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0x1F8A84D7
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0xE4999446
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0xED1BAEA5
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0xB806A0F3
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0xD582B5F7
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x69A98561
would cry.
0xDCCA2660

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x5A9243E8
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x7FC573A8

0xB04A0E33
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0xA6D10603

0xB04A0E33
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x6370B921
your friend."
0x920AF94C

0xB04A0E33
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xDB0F9E6A
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xAAD6D297
you have done."
0x9A47BCBD

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0xC3A11DA3
their faults."
0x9AFC5049

0xB04A0E33
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x52B3B087

0xB04A0E33
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x0EBA3CC8
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0x1E9C48BE

0xB04A0E33
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x6EC506D9
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xEDBF38F4

0xB04A0E33
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x86CF03FB
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0xFB4235EB

0xB04A0E33
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x8BAA7B89
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0xABFAEA2A
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0xFA9AF78C
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x9D070F31
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0xFC904EAF
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xE31B5037
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0x0C8DEF2C
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0xBADB7BCF
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0xB2039CA9
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x1D854F31
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0xC5B35D65
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0xD3DE9B1F
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0xC061E133
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x8A65EF80

0xB04A0E33
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0xA05F5943
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xD97A2F4E
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x0B4B3E80
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0xFCA74D14
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x5B499E88
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x8320F522
of my nature.
0x8D8C7D54

0xB04A0E33
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x0BDFEC32
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x54133CD3
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0xEF9C9EB2
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x5E20973C
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x94FF03EE
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xBEBA3FF1
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0xF6125B3E
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0xE660C872
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x1DEE144D
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x4C03C3F5
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x7BBB5746
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0x7258C235
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0xC71999A4
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0xAB008F1C
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0xB05374C7
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x650030FE
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x5F827507
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x0E8B1146

0xB04A0E33
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0x8F2D5616
to lunch!"
0xC40E23C9

0xB04A0E33
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0x28DF58E5
came tripping down the path.
0xC6BBC126

0xB04A0E33
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x8B06048C
called?"
0xBF237D88

0xB04A0E33
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x5213D962
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0xE14B23D1
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0xC7F65694
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x7303B912
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x89D75BDF
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0xEFA87ED9

0xB04A0E33
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0xEC3D4FC6
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xEFBC5D84

0xB04A0E33
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0xEDF725EB
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x31426475
suppose?"
0x7A4D1DA7

0xB04A0E33
I nodded.
0x2BA34343

0xB04A0E33
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x4E4676F6

0xB04A0E33
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x8A20B612

0xB04A0E33
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0xF2E502AC
be bolder."
0x629F3313

0xB04A0E33
"What! to get more knocks?"
0xF3821156

0xB04A0E33
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0xBB7E1B63
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x0336D00F
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x25612E11
for you."
0xC5AE97DB

0xB04A0E33
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0x147A9F32

0xB04A0E33
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0xC234E16A
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x123E1A59
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0x4F89E657
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xA47B70B9
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x9A3D0A97
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x325B0314

0xB04A0E33
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0xF13D0EC5

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x7E0061BC
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x8DBEBF6D
provoking."
0xA393E7D4

0xB04A0E33
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0xEE2A5742
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x3782B17E
dread."
0x571D4A5B

0xB04A0E33
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x3112D256

0xB04A0E33
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x8E8651F5

0xB04A0E33
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0xF1BB7D24
others."
0x8C1FD6A8

0xB04A0E33
"You don't show it."
0x9DA399F5

0xB04A0E33
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xF5D748E2
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x05D624DF

0xB04A0E33
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x471C8FBB
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x850FBC95
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0xDE5A3631

0xB04A0E33
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0xA578CCD2

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x0B2A23A6

0xB04A0E33
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x2B764B6B
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0x4814C2CC
you'd _rather_ not."
0x67C88235

0xB04A0E33
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0xD1296CBB
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x19A4C9F7
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xD6E5D191
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x887EA305
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER V
0xBB3E5C07

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x46D86204
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x4798D83A
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x1173513F
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0x065AFA06
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0x24AFB5EC
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x1C1CF097
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x3ED3B38A
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0xE4CCAB8F
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xC77E9397
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0x88845A6A
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xF8B567E0
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x58657628
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0x36CD3271
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0xB5CA1ABE
bye?"
0x7E15FBD6

0xB04A0E33
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x5D6EAA72
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x89F31CD7
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x15C4D4DF
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x466EF239

0xB04A0E33
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x357B7073

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x3E9D18FC
the wall."
0x785C6DD5

0xB04A0E33
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0xD57F8EF3

0xB04A0E33
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0xE608A4EC
been my foe."
0xE236AF8A

0xB04A0E33
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0x2FE9D33D

0xB04A0E33
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xB73D789E
out at the front door.
0xE0695840

0xB04A0E33
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0xD03AF51B
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x2A779265
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0xE5BF0E16
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x692BA8E5
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x893FF2C9
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0xA4AD6C86
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0xF07BFE65
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xA4056F6C
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0xFA8FF3B8

0xB04A0E33
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x2DD45ADE

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"And how far is it?"
0xE4DA5B19

0xB04A0E33
"Fifty miles."
0x87FA551C

0xB04A0E33
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x3426EF29
alone."
0xD12C98F4

0xB04A0E33
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xEC70802A
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x90C53264
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0xB4517252
with kisses.
0x70542DD4

0xB04A0E33
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x6DAC4AB5
me into the inside.
0x94B95AD9

0xB04A0E33
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xFFC00B5D
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0x50E97442
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x9A24956C
mysterious regions.
0xFFF2FE42

0xB04A0E33
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x15EB97B1
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x2CBF58F9
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x31F16D8E
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0x4F0288A7
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x184045FE
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0xC354F6EA
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xE0680AE5
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x3850E1AF
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x33AD81BF
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0xE1DC8596
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x36740F16
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0x3D34BE8C
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0xC05479F2
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0x6CD371B5
"stony street" of L-.
0x560DA14F

0xB04A0E33
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x826C33BA
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x94F20C3D
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x750737A2
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0xB5B137C6
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0xE8CF5707
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0xBCF9FB1C

0xB04A0E33
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x3CD6A90C
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x31E78240
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0xAFD98985
by the light of the lamps.
0x3FB643C6

0xB04A0E33
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0xA9CE015B
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x5FFF1D09
instantly drove away.
0x5CF641AC

0xB04A0E33
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x79D50964
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0xCA1E6F55
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x28858512
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x70A055E8
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x81281384
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x8FBFC310
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xA5CD01DC
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x34D9DB62
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0xF7042D45

0xB04A0E33
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0xF8BB1E8E
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xD6042865
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x6DBC714E
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x84AFCA15
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x625A291F
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x7333B5A3
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x9D0F2CC2

0xB04A0E33
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0x1BFA572E
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0xD31EE4FD
grave, her bearing erect.
0x0D02529C

0xB04A0E33
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0x37FFEB33
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x390428AD
then further added--
0x44859BD5

0xB04A0E33
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xEE4ACCB1
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x79E6D7F4

0xB04A0E33
"A little, ma'am."
0xF421C945

0xB04A0E33
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x873B59FC
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0x4329BFDA
come to school, my little girl?"
0x4E7AB95B

0xB04A0E33
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x4F452908
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x127D9EC0
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0xFA9BF193
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x868A1BF4
me along with Miss Miller.
0x4704E0A3

0xB04A0E33
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x861B6AC0
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x72307B31
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x48A2D28F
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x12B5F68E
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0xC8DEB1B4
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xAE528D2F
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x1C8CD6DF
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0xBD881C1A
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0x9789B781
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x54B3461E
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x1CDA7780
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x670F080E
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0xF30D9159
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x09569144
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0xA0B0F3EC
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x43F16FEE
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x0218F0EB
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0xEA68528E

0xB04A0E33
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0xDF66F8CC
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x10444CEE

0xB04A0E33
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0x2CAC3053

0xB04A0E33
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xB50B78CA
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0xF0BDBFDF

0xB04A0E33
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0x0AC009D8

0xB04A0E33
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0xCC6CD348
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x7C489684
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xEAE439C9
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x6D4075C5
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x91076266
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x0FEB5F85
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x41F6C1EA

0xB04A0E33
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x91CE94CE
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x3D4A59AB
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0x51FA48C6
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x28E41ADB
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x123173EE
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x07DEB387
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0xFC7B80A4
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x89E0F8B4

0xB04A0E33
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x5344D653
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0xF01683D7
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x7C0CF177
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x270EC480
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x5652F75A
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x3F0BB35F
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0xF1835888
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x120C9455
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0xCFB4DBA9
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x2C8B3AC9
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x2A4F9A86
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x246B7C79

0xB04A0E33
"Form classes!"
0x0140E786

0xB04A0E33
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0xDF36035A
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x34741C1E
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x5A36DF1E
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0x2567A779
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0xA8D270B4
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0xB99B2D65
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x2F014B0F

0xB04A0E33
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0xE2BCF3F0
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x1B428CE0
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0xFF7DFD6D
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0x183740D7
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x0E8BF67C

0xB04A0E33
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0xF9E4A526
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0x59B99875
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x0147DB31
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0xF63D683A
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x8FA3EAE5
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0x9893C945
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x83C4B808
little the day before.
0x9A6587CB

0xB04A0E33
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x0F3CCF7D
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0xE6049046
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0x05321643
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x35ED8945
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0xCB6F1A02
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0xBFF873FD

0xB04A0E33
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x4D8AC820

0xB04A0E33
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0xE9162104
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x9FCF38BF
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0x0DBD65CA
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x4D6FE1D2
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0xCCB4EF72
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x79D67FF6
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x76837C4D
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x10994DBA
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0xCB12322B
the meal began.
0xD2C4401F

0xB04A0E33
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0xB6900593
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0xB4C97880
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x7172A090
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0xEF62A039
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0x95ACB085
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0xB22D9D4E
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0xB0566970
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xD513A1F2
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0x82D96780
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x690251F2
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x4495AC73
them, the stout one, whispered--
0xC427BB94

0xB04A0E33
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0xADF8F994

0xB04A0E33
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x646630A0
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x21690786
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xC8BAD65E
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0xA44866B5
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x55290589
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0x00A7E4E1
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0x5419865A
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0xA2979445
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x8B2562DF
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x56F51C07

0xB04A0E33
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0xB6785FD2
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x9D6D7EC3

0xB04A0E33
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x1B7C7382

0xB04A0E33
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xFBF40B91
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0xCCB50C93
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x70866073
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0xFB7A413A
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x1F0C3DFC
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0xA2472724
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0x5E5A4433
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x31E9D6DC
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0xA36B9EAB
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x63770779
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0xDFE334B9
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xA2DB0CC1
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x5094605E

0xB04A0E33
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x02161B8D
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x38EF8A40
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0xE1356102
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x7C1A494C
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x666419A2
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x16D1A767

0xB04A0E33
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x9C08E933
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x052012CD
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x239BE267
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x564604D7
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0xF090AF9E
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0xBD49B0AD
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0x95CF4315
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x36E0E7C3

0xB04A0E33
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x7E1F2328

0xB04A0E33
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0xB249B16F
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xF35F3EAC
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0xFF48AC3F
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0x788EA528
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0xF13EDA40
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xAC8ED15E
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x4588DF1A
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x6E208053
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0xEC56CAD4
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x5CCE4252
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x5495EA1A
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0x40B5BFEB
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0x3FCB78FB
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x3C6427D6
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x56A5630B
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x0A06B9AC

0xB04A0E33
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x18AE2BDC
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0xB4EDFB70
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0xCEC0A2C3
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x075292A3
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x774CCC84
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x6E94988E
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0x08BBA6B6
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x3C8FCF38

0xB04A0E33
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xFC3B6BE1

0xB04A0E33
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0xC7122B9E
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x9867F8DA

0xB04A0E33
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x02E998ED
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x7A49E9D8
to all."
0xB0C057B8

0xB04A0E33
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x07EB24AA

0xB04A0E33
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x934F5C4D
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0x41D68CEC

0xB04A0E33
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x985501E6
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x501C9F21
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0xB96EA436
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0xAC206210
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0xE68F0B4C

0xB04A0E33
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x7866FA1A
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x4B367493
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x330C4EF2
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0xAF1C1BE8
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0xC7F379FD
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0xE4BD932E
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xDFE90574
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x6544827B
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0x5B0288AB
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0xBD72DDA3
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xFAA3F3D6
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x7C3F93E7
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0xD12A3F32
hollow cough.
0x58BF9117

0xB04A0E33
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x8F82B617
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0x97535B27
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0xB4FFE3CC
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0x905915CF
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xC5355C90
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x7C26FEFF
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x64F53068
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x1B209FFF
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x2297AFF4
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x7C19B04A
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0x9C0BE9AD
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x3BD7E10E
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xA79682F6
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0xC1C8CD50
this inscription:--
0x572FAB01

0xB04A0E33
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0xC2E5C8F3
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x30C6358D
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x9F9E25F8
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x15AB0A77

0xB04A0E33
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0xC620640F
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x83B5CE33
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x077C02CD
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0xB30A9ACC
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0xF6337F7F
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x57E5F91A
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x9E2940C0
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0xC54DBE36
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x820911C7
I said to her directly--
0x5D26211B

0xB04A0E33
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0x0C2D645A
her to lend it to me some day.
0xADFC06D8

0xB04A0E33
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0xC6B0267F
she examined me.
0xBF085598

0xB04A0E33
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0xB2226F5E
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x5DAFCE6D
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x01F0831C
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0xC6D881D0
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x7AB22597
or substantial.
0x015A01D6

0xB04A0E33
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x26EE1814

0xB04A0E33
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0xA9CBFBAF
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x152350CA
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0xCB82D69D
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0xAE491768
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x22D57B87
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0x9D0CE658

0xB04A0E33
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0xF51CE270
is Lowood Institution?"
0xCAFBC905

0xB04A0E33
"This house where you are come to live."
0x52F24220

0xB04A0E33
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0xEA182E9A
other schools?"
0x61F19938

0xB04A0E33
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0xE56FAD90
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x67137ADF
father or your mother dead?"
0xE222455C

0xB04A0E33
"Both died before I can remember."
0x904ADD49

0xB04A0E33
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0xBD590BDC
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0xA9567E4F

0xB04A0E33
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0xD1D43FBF

0xB04A0E33
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0x22FD91FC

0xB04A0E33
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0x1D11B1C3

0xB04A0E33
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0xDB8D5B76
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0x89893ADC

0xB04A0E33
"Who subscribes?"
0x65F54A49

0xB04A0E33
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0x1283087F
and in London."
0xC75BFE86

0xB04A0E33
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0x031245E2

0xB04A0E33
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0xE4BECF2E
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0xE2BEB218

0xB04A0E33
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0xB04A0E33
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0xCEE414A0

0xB04A0E33
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x0AED2253
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0x32CD810F

0xB04A0E33
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0xFD92501D
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x53851C00
all our clothes."
0x85D703F7

0xB04A0E33
"Does he live here?"
0x98C616CE

0xB04A0E33
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0xD401180F

0xB04A0E33
"Is he a good man?"
0xCD27951A

0xB04A0E33
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0xD6E48606

0xB04A0E33
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0x37C7FF17

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0xEAEADE97

0xB04A0E33
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0x68119BA7
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0x505C5FE4
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0xAFE9723C
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0x8A092B2A
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0x4E4EC16E
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0xD9CE13DA
teaches French."
0x493A1644

0xB04A0E33
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x2B1BD873

0xB04A0E33
"Well enough."
0x791497B8

0xB04A0E33
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x1A381BBD
pronounce her name as you do."
0xDA50DEF8

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0xF41A9283
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0x565BEA47

0xB04A0E33
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x077C932F

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0x71907849
she knows far more than they do."
0xB9161275

0xB04A0E33
"Have you been long here?"
0x4B63D4EE

0xB04A0E33
"Two years."
0xA1841019

0xB04A0E33
"Are you an orphan?"
0xBCA9A2A5

0xB04A0E33
"My mother is dead."
0xF4CD293D

0xB04A0E33
"Are you happy here?"
0xBBEC518E

0xB04A0E33
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x29376EE7
the present: now I want to read."
0x96E41758

0xB04A0E33
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0x23A228C6
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x1C42FE93
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0xA1AB91BE
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x938A05F4
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x2098A091
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0x67C2C249
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x179871F4
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x81D1C0EE
day's fare would be like this.
0x60564267

0xB04A0E33
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0xD3B965A9
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x94A95047

0xB04A0E33
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x32B34732
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0xD8F8FCEC
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x99ED89F6
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0xA3A953C2
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x4EE29A44
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x512C10BC
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x698CAF3D
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0x3E77DEDE
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0xE6451A84
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0x6547D8FB
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x3B0010DF
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x5AC0E645
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0x5B61E04C
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x942B9897
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x93F73050
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xAE1772A1

0xB04A0E33
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xDA58BC2E
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0x4FFD8C1D
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x916EAEC8
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x95483CEE
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x92A29A8B
first day at Lowood.
0xFA387699

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER VI
0xB0610EC5

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0xA3F8E12F
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0x7DA28FA4
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0xE3D584D1
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0xDA1BAAF8
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x05C6499B
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xE161A2C2

0xB04A0E33
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0xDBE7107C
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0xC3A0AB9D
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x782A5E6E
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0xF455B1F9

0xB04A0E33
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0xA07564D2
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x4D5AAC0C
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x7B060A85
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xAA3DBB3D
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x052F6494
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x7924C27E
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x4C6541BC
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x0FCD606F
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0xC789601F
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x927E1EF8
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x54823FBA
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x22051A99
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0xA1C4CC96
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0xFC663C87
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0xF197BFC0
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x68441348
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xFF60C10E
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0xCFFC249A
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x7C6ABBCD
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x6C781E84

0xB04A0E33
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0xC59FEA1E
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xB8837D7B
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x9E2F0FA0
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0x84CA48AD
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x4222F464
&c. &c.
0xE41954AE

0xB04A0E33
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0xFB981A4C
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0xA64E16BC
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0xB23655AD
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0x4FCAA492
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x1D4B5EAD
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xF0190814
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0x0389377C
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0xAFA11BE5

0xB04A0E33
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x162448EB
morning!"
0xED556149

0xB04A0E33
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0xBE593D95
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0xD0BCA341
as the water was frozen?"
0x0F03DAED

0xB04A0E33
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xEB795D79
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x4F322C9B
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0x0758AE2E
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0xEE9FB09F
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x4B29A5ED
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xA38832FE
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x4B3407C0
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x4CB1C7C7
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0xC1DB0FC6
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0x99152FB6
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0x885C410F
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0x76DED235
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x48F211E5
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0xA4EEDE09
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x477B8EE3
altered its ordinary expression.
0x50512EFA

0xB04A0E33
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x76175CF0
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x880B889B

0xB04A0E33
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x9C3D2B35
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x764EE077
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x75B1F518

0xB04A0E33
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x7755E487
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0xA1C1CFA4
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0xE2E119BA
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x39A1861C
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x6DDC80EE
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x4A737C7B
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x1590F066
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0x8479A7E4

0xB04A0E33
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x1BA8134B
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x6018F144
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0x45131D44
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x060EFD24
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0xFA529675
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0xCC85ACE0
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x1E43A5A7

0xB04A0E33
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x9B3CF8DE
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x58514AF9
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x2EE6385C
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x8514F3EB
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x35B1FBFF
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xF9531B5B
to clamour.
0xDF6390B5

0xB04A0E33
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x91A230C1
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x34C80099
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x1976FE9A
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0xC8358BC6

0xB04A0E33
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x8646A89C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x613B5324

0xB04A0E33
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x991CC3F2
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0xEEF466F4
floor.
0xAA8C60AF

0xB04A0E33
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x5815AB5C

0xB04A0E33
"Helen."
0x7BE69B1B

0xB04A0E33
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x520764DC

0xB04A0E33
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x4964FDC5

0xB04A0E33
"Will you ever go back?"
0x0C053149

0xB04A0E33
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x3A2216C7

0xB04A0E33
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x3F9F1466

0xB04A0E33
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0xCE357CA7
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x9F6B6B68

0xB04A0E33
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x53E39F4B

0xB04A0E33
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0xDDC55BC0

0xB04A0E33
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x22268D64
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x3C4E0723
break it under her nose."
0x9DA9C826

0xB04A0E33
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x7B48EE4F
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x77AB02D0
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0xDCC2994E
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0xCAFDC5AB
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0xABB29120
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0x325455A8

0xB04A0E33
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xFC66E368
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0x3C8D4D8F
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0x120628DF

0xB04A0E33
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x3549FF30
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x09F7AA9D
required to bear."
0x2A00C579

0xB04A0E33
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0xF8F643BB
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0xE7B356B9
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x50B1E1E8
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x46E88286
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x49CC2B6F
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x324CC72E

0xB04A0E33
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0xF112D62B
good."
0x6886D534

0xB04A0E33
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x180BE44D
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0xD6EE73DB
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0x2B579798
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x908AF131
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x5CEE9DE5
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0x6F5DFF0A

0xB04A0E33
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0x144B8F9E
addition: she kept silence.
0xAD86FCD2

0xB04A0E33
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0xD731E1F4

0xB04A0E33
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x4B9D8A99
grave face.
0xAEEDAB40

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x5089AD49
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x7A545AD2
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0xF6D65D06
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x1DCC07F9
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0xE8A61170
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0x673AD09A
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0x6C7C3EC8

0xB04A0E33
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x21C4D0DC

0xB04A0E33
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0xFF2CBB23
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0xD843B5D0
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0x2C3CE3CC
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x43884BEF
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xAC1C8783
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0xCE8C702A
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xA37D2718
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0xDF8167EA
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0x5BCC76E3
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x90205AC7
answer ready."
0xD8A32658

0xB04A0E33
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x2D7C1CF0

0xB04A0E33
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xE133A7C2
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x08227424
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x410370D1
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0xD5A341F8
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0xA2283919
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0xAE2241AA
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x2B8363FC
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0x9B018089
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x79340D04
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0x138BAFAE

0xB04A0E33
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0x7C03D815
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x9DF89C3C
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x3A07576A

0xB04A0E33
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0xD1538362

0xB04A0E33
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x96A1B721
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x54232EED
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x162EED0D
I wished to gain."
0xEDC8CB0A

0xB04A0E33
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0xB1FDAC89

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0x989083D1
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0xF45132C4

0xB04A0E33
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0xA21917DB
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x386B2871
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0xD76C6660
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xE0135E6D
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x371E0E9D
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x6FF00D8F
person who struck us never to do it again."
0x368C1C3A

0xB04A0E33
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0x85E59B91
but a little untaught girl."
0x43F2AF2F

0xB04A0E33
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x88B42577
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0x91041578
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0x88905A8F
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0xCBD38FF9

0xB04A0E33
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0xA9E1C732
civilised nations disown it."
0x8D0B387C

0xB04A0E33
"How?  I don't understand."
0xDB560945

0xB04A0E33
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0x12C28605
certainly heals injury."
0xB9C76C5C

0xB04A0E33
"What then?"
0xC12CF101

0xB04A0E33
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0xFE0CD780
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0xFA5B41CF

0xB04A0E33
"What does He say?"
0x721D746F

0xB04A0E33
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0xF6B67E7B
you and despitefully use you."
0x751F746D

0xB04A0E33
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0x7EAA40D2
John, which is impossible."
0xC5E8BF49

0xB04A0E33
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0x7DEA24B5
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0x210EA8A7
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x9FF49DFE
softening.
0xF0C48CD9

0xB04A0E33
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0xC3633244
remark, but she said nothing.
0xE3B3C974

0xB04A0E33
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0x1D22B3CA
woman?"
0x9BA920B5

0xB04A0E33
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0x3F3D1F72
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x8782B7B4
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x4C10971E
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x62C214BD
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0x7156026F
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0x12D7F55F
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x8354FF8F
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0xED56F452
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x3C834855
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xD3500C34
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0xE2A633C6
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0xE166C550
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x977405EF
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x6F093826
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0xAA976A53
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x408E0E89
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xF8035BAE
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x26A1434D
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0xA5F4AB40
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xA6F74B96
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0x069823DF
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x6BAFD57B
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0x9E6BA519
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x5EB98C2E
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x10C45751

0xB04A0E33
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0x26674619
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xBCE95F33
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0x8D9208E3
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x163BED6C
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0x7F29115F

0xB04A0E33
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x7F48A370
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x0C5CFCEC

0xB04A0E33
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x59F70531
without reply as without delay.
0x044BD0B6

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER VII
0x62F7D57D

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x02B08AE0
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0xC4069F42
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0xFA9B2330
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x7D7D4DAB
were no trifles.
0x872F1409

0xB04A0E33
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0xD6D1B1DE
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0xD9B0950F
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x5B86A0AE
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x44B6D1F0
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x29ED9C15
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0xEA3A77D5
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x0483F10A
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x1FB16A90
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x4955276B
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x1E6671CE
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0x1AC45F25
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0x57B8757F
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x9D365303
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x7E4D4BC9
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0x406B13E2
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x00FB18BF
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0xECD625BA
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x835A1171
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x407DE570

0xB04A0E33
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x1BC870F7
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0x903EE60D
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x5B46055C
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x1EC5375E
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0xC2B580FF
meals, was served round between the services.
0x3C099A32

0xB04A0E33
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0xC283496F
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0x7F8B6CAF
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x30C7DD1D

0xB04A0E33
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x629EC37D
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0xF7BAFBB3
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x5C7F92EA
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0xB1697B39
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x81B32ACB
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x25738A22

0xB04A0E33
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0x35B4C8BA
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x1FB8B063
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0xD87745AC
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0x0063E47E
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x8C68546C

0xB04A0E33
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0xD9AB9F84
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x20C89DAA
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0xAD10B23C
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x487489E1
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0xEFFA2DD6
invariably obliged to part with.
0xBFBAEFA3

0xB04A0E33
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0xB4479346
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x4A6FAD09
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xD22C44EC
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x0B416E0E
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x6806E629
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x28D37533
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0xFA75A1D1
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x72ED866B
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0xDB55C13C
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0xA49B64BD
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xC62D8132

0xB04A0E33
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x8908C7E7
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0xD2DD8EC8
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0x852FE654
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x3C4B42CD
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x7D6015FB

0xB04A0E33
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xE5CF9220
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xEC7A8CF5
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x4DC2574F
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0xBC4DB96C
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x47071F7C
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0xA805CBA1
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x80702809
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x9821D75D
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xE87F3E4D
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x24E9D38E
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0xDC31D2E8
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x996C5329

0xB04A0E33
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xCE637987
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x566E8B51
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0xB687CAD8
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0x046CB6D6
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0x105EF655
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x35179B93
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x3889C085

0xB04A0E33
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0xE11060BB
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x2E8B9595
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x1873E4D2
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0x9ECF299D
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0xD51EBB37
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xD1A8ECE4

0xB04A0E33
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x4F41456F
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x22C5925A
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x1610E136
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x949FFA0E
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0x6978179F
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0xCB60B5D6
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x8DAB538F
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0xABF8EDA3
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x3B60D987
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0xDBBCD8BB
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0xB636B5E7

0xB04A0E33
He paused.
0x768DF121

0xB04A0E33
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x486CDAE8

0xB04A0E33
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xF8112125
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x7093E7C0
to one."
0x6C768F5D

0xB04A0E33
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x07792735
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0x223A3B55
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0xA5BD41FC
occasion."
0x433792D3

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x985D19CC

0xB04A0E33
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xC90A4DBA
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x70E69352
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0xD6856EF0
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0xD5717DA1
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x61B1B09A
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0xC1AD5F99
what authority?"
0xEE802A7D

0xB04A0E33
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0x3A81D978
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x745C7D3E
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0x5EB7942F

0xB04A0E33
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x5E3C46FD
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0xD7A5237C
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x1A3F5AEC
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x960B8059
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0x7B697F93
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0x40510862
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x07391DA9
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x85C3F516
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0xB347BFA3
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0x5F574108
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x102DDCE0
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xE7285573
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0xD16FD353
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x1AD0FFB4
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0xF8380A98
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x655E5616
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x34CBA330
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x6E556DFD
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0xF9A64946

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x54F0A2F1
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x543D6544
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x41C48932
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x5283E7E0
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0x7099E9D6
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x6B0C0AE5
severity.
0x27907EBC

0xB04A0E33
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0x193A2669
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x24867EBD
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0xBF4F53CE
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0x11A4B17C

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0xF4A29DD0
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x74BA2AF5
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x8F490305

0xB04A0E33
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0xB7BC9DBB

0xB04A0E33
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x0A19242A
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x60F0A1B6
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0x53277FD4
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x87658610

0xB04A0E33
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0xFCE668AA

0xB04A0E33
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0xF6B7CD30
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x66270BBA
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x1CA3B261
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x1340D9D8
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x330E4A2F
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x9CAC4CAA
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0x913C6305

0xB04A0E33
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x8F436544
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x27CB7BAF
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0xAA5EF4F0
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x50741E98
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x843C66D3
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0xADAF502B
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x50AC86EB
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0xC9D950CD

0xB04A0E33
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x77D8BED3
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0x46067D5D

0xB04A0E33
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x680D8859

0xB04A0E33
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0x8673655C

0xB04A0E33
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0x4E429798
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0xE93F3B66
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0xE085DE08
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0x7B2F0643
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x18873D4A
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x2D46852B
time wasted, of--"
0xCA418551

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0xACAC4004
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x9C29340C
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x4123DFA7
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0xE507FD35
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x9DEB0862
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x416ECDF3
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0xF6EFC5F5
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x1C2DAFE4
false front of French curls.
0x46BAE68E

0xB04A0E33
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x789C27AB
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x8F03EACC
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x444E1582
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x66FBD755
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x69C2255C
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x050C12CC
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x23119EC2
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0xE23A0AD0
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0xED42E8BC
my attention.
0xAD142C93

0xB04A0E33
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x09EA9117
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x15B085C9
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x7727FD4B
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xB4DEA27A
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x2B8585DC
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0xAF949324
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0x06B30E82
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0x4D2D8EF4
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0xAC406F25
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x9B6487C6

0xB04A0E33
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x4DBAA0EE
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x25141BFB
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x975A0A69
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x0C94F5A7

0xB04A0E33
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0xD482B450
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x212CE16D
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0xBB9FCC3A
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xEA4ED585

0xB04A0E33
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0x14A015DF
punished."
0x999189FA

0xB04A0E33
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x329FFAE5

0xB04A0E33
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x47F9A805
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x41D31054
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x00257B5F

0xB04A0E33
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x911628B1
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0xAFFE75E5

0xB04A0E33
"Place the child upon it."
0x4B8921DB

0xB04A0E33
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x3CF3A123
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0xFCA8D896
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0xAA2551F1
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x3C51DECC
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x5ADECD79

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0xA21B30AE

0xB04A0E33
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x4FBC332B
children, you all see this girl?"
0x04733256

0xB04A0E33
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0xE45C9FAA
against my scorched skin.
0x14E41A34

0xB04A0E33
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x5BD2CAF3
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x5BD6B23C
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x17CAA44C
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0x47571DD9
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x14E74C5A

0xB04A0E33
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xEF2EF8E8
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xF6E889E9
must be firmly sustained.
0x3473CFA7

0xB04A0E33
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0xFA1993E1
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x85482DB4
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0xF0B6509F
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0x80A29E6F
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x5C1F8B90
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x4B7D88D3
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x58DEA3AD
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x44D30CCD
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0x0D6267A4
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0xDC9BC18F
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x018072B3
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x03516B7C

0xB04A0E33
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x249C03B2
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x309A8486
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0xF9472F39
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x2755A65B
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xADF62BAF

0xB04A0E33
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x46A1389C
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0xF3E7A169
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xB908F476
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xC93EDD35
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0xF9ADAD7A
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x448D0804
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x48BE25E0
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0xBA5E1C6E
waters to stagnate round her."
0xD8D4944F

0xB04A0E33
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x109580FD
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x2176012A
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x8C651FBB
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0xB8296CEE

0xB04A0E33
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0xA57B2B57
her during the remainder of the day."
0x71C29A85

0xB04A0E33
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0xA7E2C1F9
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x5EDC908C
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x42F3E304
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0x3EC4B3C8
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0xDDC47E1C
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x1538349E
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0x87261245
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0x1875216E
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x595037EA
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x51DBF8A6
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x9B27E1A3
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x50B1D32F
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x99601891
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x57EC035D
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x8694463E
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x2593D194
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0xD28E4E6B
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0x176A779E
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0xB3082290
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xE8AE7757
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x883C4730
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0x018283C4

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x8A0D5F3A
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0xB545D28D
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0xC2E4C868
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0xC991ACA0
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x50D29B88
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xF3FBFB3A
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0xD751920C
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x884BA9C6
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0xDE48CD4F
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0xEAF61262
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x95A74FB4
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0xF6275B38
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x2AC0353D
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x21AB17F5
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0x4DF80E3D
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xE1A75F06

0xB04A0E33
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x64CE128F
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x1BB63E8A
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x5276BC86
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x571B0AEB

0xB04A0E33
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x5C50E246
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0xCABCC2AF
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x840FC9D9
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x82F6ED3D
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0x9C10A219
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0xD60C860E
first who spoke--
0x050FF4E8

0xB04A0E33
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xAFCDFB34
liar?"
0x2F7DF018

0xB04A0E33
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x297A6749
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x91EA52FE

0xB04A0E33
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0x03C14025

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x2E1B7779
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0xEB370789

0xB04A0E33
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0xD926269B

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x36E8DAF2
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x20A0D2AD
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x2D05B895
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x2854F819
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0xC2C2592B
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x10A366C8
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x119363DC
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x9F58915E
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x1438ADE4

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x73FF5B2B
gently to warm them, and went on--
0x70E899D7

0xB04A0E33
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0xF021E0F5
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x64EC9399
without friends."
0x135BE6BF

0xB04A0E33
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x406DB42C
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x75557BCB
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xA4CC3651
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0xA894731F
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x6ECC1794
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0xA4993062

0xB04A0E33
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x8158FFFE
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x5266F93C
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0xAFCBFEAC
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x42195053
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0xA445F94B
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0xE6AD6FF5
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x3B907C9B
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0x92DE4BFD
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x01BD6834
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x172CE858
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0x91352DF8
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0x567E52AC
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0xC4FBA22A
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0x50AC3F4B
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xF71DE2F5

0xB04A0E33
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x5BB44FFF
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x2C2EC4DE
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0x1E975F36
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0x77876303
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0xD9978B40

0xB04A0E33
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0xB331B6AA
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x6E58DFF9
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x24FD68F0
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0x118D92A1
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0xFF9706EE
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0xDA2C765F

0xB04A0E33
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xF14298A9
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x7EE962AF

0xB04A0E33
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x12D2B8A1
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x676C1CF6
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xD278EC64
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x1FBB4EAA
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x8EEEEDC3

0xB04A0E33
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x56DAFFD7
your grief away?"
0xFA3278C4

0xB04A0E33
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0xFA14221A

0xB04A0E33
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0xB04A0E33
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0xA6BDECC4
will now think me wicked."
0x51FBA39B

0xB04A0E33
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x3A443327
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0x88540D7D

0xB04A0E33
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x342CA28B

0xB04A0E33
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xFCED25F2
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x16AD8939

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x78E31CCD
care."
0x26616585

0xB04A0E33
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0xE3F4431A

0xB04A0E33
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xB81B9B45
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0x2753B266
always keep me."
0x8116CA01

0xB04A0E33
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0x9D4A942C
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x52FD1740
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x75CBDA23
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x2F84B527
exaggerate nothing."
0xE7D23A1B

0xB04A0E33
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x0C9C6C2B
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0x81D81CE1
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0x7516E243
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x30745C8F
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0x7A1C4182
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0xC8DE458B
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xAFC264E8
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x7D20BD02
Temple fully believed me.
0xB0879916

0xB04A0E33
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0xFDF16D7F
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0x8BC27AF2
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0xD955BBAD
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x2F492D4A
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x273E7646
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x3A767CAC

0xB04A0E33
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0xE326FC61
then said--
0xAB77B01C

0xB04A0E33
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x0371E1E0
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0xD7C061FB
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0xE6DE16D4

0xB04A0E33
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0xC3C3C6E9
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x81B132FD
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0xCE0864D1
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0x446B83B5
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xA03CFD78

0xB04A0E33
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x90BBAD52

0xB04A0E33
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x06745A08

0xB04A0E33
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x6198DF9F

0xB04A0E33
"It is a little better."
0x910A574E

0xB04A0E33
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x108EDD54
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0x061C5747
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0xBF3AA251

0xB04A0E33
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xED69B8CD
rang her bell.
0x4E004B6D

0xB04A0E33
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0xBBDB8DD8
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x6D3BBDFB

0xB04A0E33
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0x51E134C1
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x494F9F9F
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x88B4467E
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x9E45FEB5
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0xDFF15AEB

0xB04A0E33
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0x054CB7B8
There is not enough for three."
0x74976738

0xB04A0E33
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0x287BA290

0xB04A0E33
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x2916A3FF

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x48B3EC01
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x53378893

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0xF827B1D8
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x0EDA6D2E
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x6CE0AA74

0xB04A0E33
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0xB2A592D9
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xE81BB3DC
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x3BD2CE6B
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x3D9B750B

0xB04A0E33
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0x634E3577
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x82CE35D4
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x776B646F

0xB04A0E33
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0xCAF706D8
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x455CE426
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x5568A809
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x0EBD1CEF

0xB04A0E33
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xCB9EAEEF
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0xE72679D2
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0xF9354E5C

0xB04A0E33
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x1214790B
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x92701218
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x41DAEEED
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0xFB9B9728
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x3D84DB5F
struck with wonder.
0x74068437

0xB04A0E33
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x5B3EC160
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0xF930366B
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0x0F34A26F
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0xCD404C98
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x3CD71B15
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0xF457D24B
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x5D2D51DF
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0xFB42D181
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x212F449E
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0xC1B256EE
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xE3673F9F
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0x8DD8599F
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0xE9EB2A71
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x3282227C

0xB04A0E33
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x1DE29F3F
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0xFCA9FCC6
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x84B3F223
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0xA5796CF4
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x185EF24C
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xF5F3D5DF
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x16C7D62F
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x34B69148
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0xECE510C0
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xB2FE6542
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x3100AE52

0xB04A0E33
"God bless you, my children!"
0xDCB707A0

0xB04A0E33
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0xE710AF56
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0xB5E41597
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x1E523EC5

0xB04A0E33
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x8268F2BE
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x87D4F596
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0xE2195CEE
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x335FB7CE
shoulder.
0xD745D042

0xB04A0E33
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0xD4E1453F
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x30D851DE

0xB04A0E33
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0xAEA02630
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x713E10BD
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0xA6B9F30D
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0xC75B99CD
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x05CB7C19
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0xB1F85173
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x1BB7F130
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x621B4B12
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0xB2C8BAC0

0xB04A0E33
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0xA4A42697
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0xF37CA061
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0xEB32E244
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x6D68D3EF
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0x9276BC75
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x9AFD1A99
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x7B127BD4
through the ranks of my companions.
0xB424BB6D

0xB04A0E33
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x7F489E29
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0x74BB1FE6
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x4D10412C
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x72C587CE
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x89749B62
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0xD079CCAA
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x4C1ED104
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x9148E218
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x944E012D
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x533A172A
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x0E6AEDE6
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0xEC61AF93
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0x5435F6F4
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x63C2765B
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0x9C7926DF
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with

young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xABB1CFA9
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x0A16B748
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0xE37C81A6
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

CHAPTER IX
0x7DA2D0A2

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0xED64042A
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0x42F384FD
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xD4B5157D
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x9D5C0184
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x03C540C4
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0xBF411419
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0xDD505929
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x52A84A64
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x74CE97A4
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x968054AA
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0xE50AFAC2
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x234D3E62
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0xE44F4DF4
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x71B27DEE

0xB04A0E33
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xCF40DF1B
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x3BAF2791
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0xD1016DDA
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x0492F022
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x1DE8CA74
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0xD148B416
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x7FB29270
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0x130D9455
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x4E56F391
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x6B90545C
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x70EA683E
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x6376AEEC
of skeletons.
0xF7D9EC3D

0xB04A0E33
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x8DC2DEFA
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0xCB96AE29
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x869BBCEE
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0xE8105D98
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0xF7BA678A
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xDB2B4527
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0xD82C6E34
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0x8E1860D8
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x9BDB1CD6
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x47DC46D0
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0xB037C315
advert.
0xCA5794AB

0xB04A0E33
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x1C2993AA
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x1DF25809
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0xEE941A07
question.
0x3DC0ED84

0xB04A0E33
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x3CDC2EE2
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0x21558BE9
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0xDC293490
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0xE78EEB0F
hospital.
0xCBEDCCD0

0xB04A0E33
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x86682088
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x504D41CF
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x6247429E
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0x6BAD2243
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x3017180E
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0x3143A02E
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x7524C72E
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x6883CC10
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x37CD02AC
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0xD568738C
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xDBDDD3F6
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x4A9FF758
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0x5E941C80
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x0CDF95B7

0xB04A0E33
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x0DA26CC8
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x1BE5E7DE
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x43F2A7BC
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0x4BB0F421
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0x0460ADD7
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0x088FD082
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0x378B0AC1
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0x9425887A
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0xC2765CD5
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0xAB3897E7
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0x935224C1
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xEC57E884

0xB04A0E33
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0xFAA607B1
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x37564816
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x29F67324
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0xBCF8E473
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0x28BC3AD0
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x1EF113B2
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x4626EE64
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x3980F46F
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x4206172E
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0xF988303B
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0xCB405438
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x0BCD56A1
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x9EFFEB05

0xB04A0E33
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x41D4DB5F
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0xC6F797F9
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0x9FBA9535
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0xF39FE1C3
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xA5F997EA
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xBBC27E6B
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x132553A9
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0xAE4B8041
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x25BDA5DC
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x55EF1082
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x4DCC9686
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x858B00C1
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x5E1F7D3D

0xB04A0E33
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0xBECAD9E5
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xF9C1CDBE
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0xBE77ED8C
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x31477C9B
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0xE48D8758
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x7F3ECF10
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x4198DACF
higher things.
0x44985D1F

0xB04A0E33
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0xAEAAEB26
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0xC4C6F7D1
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x545C83EE
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0xEDB13152
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x20FBF792
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0x6CBBEBD7
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x973A370F
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0x2CCD0914
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x4524BC41
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0xF43B091B
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x5F5470AB
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0xD54FB455
alleviate.
0x31F6E7AF

0xB04A0E33
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0xE68B9432
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0xF4E78E9B
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x8D14A098
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0xAEC355DA
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x78670096
verandah.
0xDB723B5A

0xB04A0E33
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x43C9C658
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x2F3BB5E2
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x23F9D69D
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x91C2B609
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0x0CEC45E2
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x3B110283
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x6BB47D6C
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x1F8D40BF
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0xA52C5A3E
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x5FA4E268
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x604CBD85
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x275FCC84
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xB584B204
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x83A56408
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x206A5F60
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0xF33A0F4C
done before:--
0xC195B701

0xB04A0E33
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0xA9C7B206
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0xCECD6CB7
have to go who knows where?"
0x99AD6E30

0xB04A0E33
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x74EBDF01
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0xCE90EFE5
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x13686102
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0x80D5D033
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x756CD130
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0xC799BCA0
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x27DC6D7B
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x93C3A902
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x1127D3B6
ran up to her.
0x62771DC4

0xB04A0E33
"How is Helen Burns?"
0x98BD8934

0xB04A0E33
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xC93B40D1

0xB04A0E33
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0xAECC05E3

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"And what does he say about her?"
0x116069B8

0xB04A0E33
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x4D7B27B0

0xB04A0E33
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xA4215107
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x141620D2
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xB8B970F3
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0xAC856929
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xBFEF338C
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xE129DAF3
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x21F6B03E
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0xD9523951

0xB04A0E33
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0x2199EDCF

0xB04A0E33
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0xF8514D8A

0xB04A0E33
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x13D8F65A
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x5ECD7F32

0xB04A0E33
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x9B4E2AB2
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0xE0A35480
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0x333FBDE8

0xB04A0E33
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0xA65BEE7F
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x8BB62D1D
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x1125E835
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x3C2FB4E8
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0xFC0A759B
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0xB87E3D68
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0xBE9EFBBA
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x7108D7FB
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0x1E7A0AC0
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x9745048C
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x1396D8A0
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0xC001BFAB
with her one last word.
0x46DD48EF

0xB04A0E33
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x92791B12
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0xDDC2D419
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0x38410426
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0x2323B6F3
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x72B56D30
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0x4ADD0FE5
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x2CEC188D
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x902E5A58
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x96A86613

0xB04A0E33
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x3B5F6DCF
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x8AF5FB1A
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0xADF2F5E3
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x44ECE29D
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xEE17747D
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x6F0DB553
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x204FD10C
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xC348CB24
of seeing a corpse.
0xF0AC5F83

0xB04A0E33
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xC00D4984

0xB04A0E33
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x14D74119
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x1B749BFE
instantly dissipated.
0x7A1480A1

0xB04A0E33
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0x7D13FF4C

0xB04A0E33
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x395318D9
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xAF7AAFD9

0xB04A0E33
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0x912369E2
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x6740B176
old.
0x0D3E0331

0xB04A0E33
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xCC26E5EB
strike some minutes since."
0x387E30D3

0xB04A0E33
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x16ACFCE1
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0x0282C816

0xB04A0E33
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0x4D4C94E9

0xB04A0E33
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0xD25E835A

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x5DACBC2D

0xB04A0E33
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0xE4291AB4
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x14BE241B
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x5F0D38FE
whispered--
0xCB4AB88C

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x9C2BDB09
quilt."
0xE5433BDB

0xB04A0E33
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0x3F9143E7
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0xB4B7D8A8

0xB04A0E33
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0x31AB0050
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0xA7DBFFC5
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0xBD97C582
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x608E3F46
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0x6BA85DC4
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x4EC5DCB2
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xBE039AE6
been continually at fault."
0x7DB69269

0xB04A0E33
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0x3F842BD0

0xB04A0E33
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0xFFCEF3A1

0xB04A0E33
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x69BE7648

0xB04A0E33
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0xE3083AA9
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0x34AF6993
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0xB82D7F12
reveal Him to me."
0x27DC54A4

0xB04A0E33
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0x909C9742
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xB3D3D3CD

0xB04A0E33
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0xC218F253
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x689E0DF8
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0xD15CF3E8

0xB04A0E33
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0xA93A982C

0xB04A0E33
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0xABFA2108
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x7DE2B39A

0xB04A0E33
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x88028557
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x42264404
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x9E6A042B
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0x45EA7588
tone--
0x29C2F472

0xB04A0E33
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0xA468BA4C
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x9D36BF39
near me."
0xC7E4EE48

0xB04A0E33
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0x0520309B

0xB04A0E33
"Are you warm, darling?"
0xB312180C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Good-night, Jane."
0xBCCE4500

0xB04A0E33
"Good-night, Helen."
0x2CD1C376

0xB04A0E33
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0x61C0701D

0xB04A0E33
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0xEC5CE12A
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0xD2A7653A
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0xB0CB85F0
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0xBA5E1477
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0x62C814A7
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0xA1E86C25
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x3FD424E5
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xF6DA36C6

0xB04A0E33
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xA9BF37AD
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x638F5469
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
0xCEA57809

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER X
0x6F8DF284

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x883191F2
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x30626AD1
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x2F193561
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x0BB4C00C
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x08CA3BC8
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x2B04BFB9
connection.
0xE191C068

0xB04A0E33
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xBA875A4C
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x50789B79
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0xBBEF0B63
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x015F97EA
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x54EC9D66
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x6BB7AE87
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0xF60FB942
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0xAF1F7032
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xEDC738B3
beneficial to the institution.
0x200E1199

0xB04A0E33
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0xAFF1EFCE
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x503739BD
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x4012DAA3
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0xE6531F68
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0xDBB54DA5
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x27ED62E2
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0x92E6E88A
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0x3AD02B7E
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0xD9DE5351
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x0B375866
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0xBD3D57AA
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xDFA51702
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x3536B320
testimony to its value and importance.
0x907003B1

0xB04A0E33
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0x9FA8B7DD
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x7921CEEA
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0x1C57D6F0
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x51C69AAD
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0xE62655C4
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0xF40D0220
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xD0DF2246
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xD8EC5F52

0xB04A0E33
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x53ED7920
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0xF1BF3D16
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x714C9843
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xF8F414AB
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x4FFE89EC
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0xDC847D2B
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xB2C55858

0xB04A0E33
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x9C6F3D23
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x9EEB9590
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0x7074E733
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x9D8BB89E
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xADDEE55F
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x70C8BDFF
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x08B797DF
character.
0xDDB6DA54

0xB04A0E33
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x0903D35B
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0xA4B54612
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x5EB2ED53
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0xCA2E668D
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x5C9CAC77
of the occasion.
0xF298DED5

0xB04A0E33
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x86CFC6A9
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0xC16D6D5D
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x2636C0D4
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0x80693900
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0xC6BEFEE7
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x62990DB7
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0xC31AE454
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0xBF5D70FA
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x0F67D3AE
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xB799CB9C
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0x4F2464C2
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x22BFB4F3
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x8AC55176
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x0EF33E05
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x18D144A5
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x5B7896CE

0xB04A0E33
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0xC29BCC75
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x6E9B2C9B
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x6EBBCEB6
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x40FFCF4E
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x2D1B9D2C
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x5257308B
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x8F639AB2
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x03421A2F
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0xAFD3D890
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x023A784A
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xD9DF1C2F
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x5D9E25A7
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0x207D0FEA
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0x99562772
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x6D975F17
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0xD98CB7BB
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x48A9BBF4
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x8852FD50
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xEF44902A
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x1E3BEC8E
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x5BCF76AA
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xC885FEFA

0xB04A0E33
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x447DDD29

0xB04A0E33
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0xF577F538
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0xD6ACF9FD
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x7B0E29BB
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0xCA266885
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0xFF5807DD
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x3E4E22D0

0xB04A0E33
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x31611381
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0xFA4C19EF
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x5DDE9ADE
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x5E8C8AFE
instantly revived.
0xD85DAB7A

0xB04A0E33
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x49838E72
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x1D41C140
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0xFAE02A67
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0xAA1DBB56
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x40D8D2AB
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x47BD9090
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0xBA24BFF8
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0xD493957C
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0xECCB8416
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0xCB4BDF93

0xB04A0E33
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x5D7A81BD
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xB487856F
think_ again with all my might.
0x7C098390

0xB04A0E33
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0xA1AD7651
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x0474FCEF
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0xBBC36FD2
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0xAA400C3C
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0xC66B7D2D
their resource?"
0x0315A334

0xB04A0E33
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0xC362FEFE
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x9569F388
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0xB334CBAF
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xCD964EA2
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x0803B28B
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0x590BFFC8

0xB04A0E33
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0xE323DDC7
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xA90DAFF2
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x8A8BE3B2
_---shire Herald_."
0x15011A8D

0xB04A0E33
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0xCD200309

0xB04A0E33
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0xFE354D36

0xB04A0E33
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0xEDA9716F
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0xF39332EB
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0xDE3DB947
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0xAEF105EC
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0xB152C8AF

0xB04A0E33
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x77F894F4
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x2AC2EF12

0xB04A0E33
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x988F8DA1
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0x3CF20D83

0xB04A0E33
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0xFE410F85
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x2467FFC0
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0x4A65D1B3
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0xFDAE526A
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0x8700EBA0
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0xD6A6022E
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0xD27FA029
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0x10E221EF
shire."
0x53B41F2B

0xB04A0E33
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0x933A36DA
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x1141F608
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x2B561010
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0xEE0187A7
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0xF03B09CE
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x45B6BB96
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0x66568CD6

0xB04A0E33
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x81287192
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0xEFFAEA13
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x607E5C18
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0xCAA2DCD6
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0x4C5E233A
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0x471251FE
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0xE89C0967

0xB04A0E33
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0xCB6AAC93
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x51625545
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x4FE64CDF
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xDA487D76
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0x7ADB6020

0xB04A0E33
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0xBBA2EE68

0xB04A0E33
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0xF96E15C6
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x78EFEDFF
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0xB03F91F6
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0xD801D6A5
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0xDD18CD4D

0xB04A0E33
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0xA154DB48

0xB04A0E33
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x05D79B94
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x141A489D
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xC98EF88E

0xB04A0E33
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x368D1EFC
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x0152297C
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x8B7AB948
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x0BBEC57E
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0xCB2B5614
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0xD75CE061
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x458A4034
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x94BC1FAC
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0xA76A8A6F
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x8712FE7C

0xB04A0E33
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x4A8C822F
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0xAD30402D
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x5D7AF562
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0x8A89D296
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0x95F959AE
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0x3549DB9A
direction:--
0x5BBECB6C

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x1CC81D98

0xB04A0E33
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x36AA4D49
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x51BBA116
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x9E65F8E9
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0x962B2BAC
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x51A1079E
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0xCC33845A
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xB528CEEA
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0x5655F5E1
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x55B08033
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x863AB726
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0xE7CEE490
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x4589BBF9
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x3876EDE9
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x84C69223
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0xA2D8A06C
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xB22AEA20
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0x9847E033
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0xD20CB3CE
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xBF642B2D
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x9C9D15DB

0xB04A0E33
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x0EFA4980

0xB04A0E33
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0xE6272607
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0xB20833CB
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x83936661
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0x7EAB62CA
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x09D4D96D
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x27099C5C
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x278E6C64
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x4DBFAF59
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x186C9399
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0xC1DA4002
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x1A4347C7
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x87E18D8D
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0xFAD31365
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x41E376DF
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0xCAD9648E
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x094D720C
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x4D25EEA6
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xDED0D61A
forthwith be furnished me.
0x82C834A8

0xB04A0E33
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x8FB15BE5
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x246FA2C5
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0xFAB15FB0
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0x24E1D836

0xB04A0E33
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0xE0B97A64
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0xFDDBC62C
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0xC491E417
years ago from Gateshead.
0xAB402E27

0xB04A0E33
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x02072142
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0x7B1DB186
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x6426892F
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x7106BACE
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x3F2B529B
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0xF4DDFEEC
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x75CFB9B9
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xB411E7F3
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x47790710
while the change was being accomplished.
0x4C227B2D

0xB04A0E33
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0xD9138EAF
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0xD0864728

0xB04A0E33
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xB4DC3E67
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0x24FFA9EB
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0xBD1C9CA6

0xB04A0E33
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0xA1992F56
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0xFB61DE2B

0xB04A0E33
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x5B769BF8
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0xFF8A607B
complexion.
0x1B43505F

0xB04A0E33
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0xCC80C976
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x8BFCA0F3

0xB04A0E33
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x6C6B7D7D
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x617721C0
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x237F9F37
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0xBA038AE3

0xB04A0E33
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x1CF0D7EF

0xB04A0E33
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x35693F2C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x5C3598B8
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x4B15326F

0xB04A0E33
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x38E08F76

0xB04A0E33
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0xF1E31B2B

0xB04A0E33
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x9081DD02
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0xFE9CA4DC
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x55474597

0xB04A0E33
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0x3C3F93E7
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0xA327B6A9
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xD84B11A6
would make two of you in breadth."
0x9B8039ED

0xB04A0E33
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0x36CA6C04

0xB04A0E33
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0xEAFC02D9
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0xE1585B7D
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xD15532DB
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0xE339683E
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0xE67277C9
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0x20D3FA22
quarrelling--"
0xDA03C76E

0xB04A0E33
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x97CAE246

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0x221FF29F
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x9FC001E9
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0xB8861935
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0x0711ED2C

0xB04A0E33
"What does he look like?"
0xCE375CB4

0xB04A0E33
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x844FA47F
has such thick lips."
0xE5FFA60B

0xB04A0E33
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x77A43A81

0xB04A0E33
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x53453E25
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0xCA38D9B7
a deal of money."
0x0B16C40E

0xB04A0E33
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x0C317F03

0xB04A0E33
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0xE3DE5DA6
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0x3E7DF68E
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x3BF3D32B
you were quite out of my reach."
0xDF6D2C29

0xB04A0E33
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x3CBBF327
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0x2126C6FC
shape denote admiration.
0x9B66C55E

0xB04A0E33
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0xD8C85B82
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x63361B03
a child."
0x9612C8ED

0xB04A0E33
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x2BED9391
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x5C4D8027
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x859D964B
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x10A0993C

0xB04A0E33
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x65CAE7D1
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0xCAE1588E

0xB04A0E33
"A little."
0x0FA1CA48

0xB04A0E33
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0x366B0356
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x0A740C5C
charmed.
0x0FB8A53F

0xB04A0E33
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0xEA6153CF
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0xE2E6604A

0xB04A0E33
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xD018001A
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0x17560CFB
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x434428A2
and which she had framed and glazed.
0xECEDF5CC

0xB04A0E33
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x060F074B
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x64D98CC4
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x074BE85D

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0xD0882E20

0xB04A0E33
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0x2FFEB7D9

0xB04A0E33
"I can."
0x91765788

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0x024B7179
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0xB3E66C85
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0x83D1709C
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0xB92C7E2F

0xB04A0E33
"Never in my life."
0x7D974133

0xB04A0E33
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0xFE72EA08
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x0E188A3E
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x09B7F264
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xE9DB8046
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x3DAC6E62
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0xF25494BF
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0xE9120B8F
father's brother."
0xFAED3E50

0xB04A0E33
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x72C3FABA

0xB04A0E33
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x82ED9A48
tell me--"
0x241B3653

0xB04A0E33
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0xC152AF61

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xC2E95488

0xB04A0E33
"So he went?"
0x8E54064C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0xD1C33825
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x021CCFB0
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0xF1834100

0xB04A0E33
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x6E1349D2
wine-merchant."
0xD75CEC59

0xB04A0E33
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0xF6D0C0C6
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0xCAF691F2
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x1677A198
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xC6B2EA3D
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0xBEC98EAA
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x8D1948A5
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x5CA3D49C

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XI
0x64A8C37C

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0xF291C1DE
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0xF9A79B68
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0xCA0D2F38
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x5197CCA0
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0xE4DFD92D
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0xB9590AE0
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x1C7E70F8
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xD1EB1B0D
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xAF261B8E
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0xCE2E7282
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xCB960B4E
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x50D8559C

0xB04A0E33
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xB4F075D0
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0xBED29F8B
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0xAB9C73C7
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x08A81612
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x6FF85A53
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x34905E77
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0xC27201EE
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x0CFE3907
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0xD47F9DAE
troubling my thoughts.
0xC48807CC

0xB04A0E33
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x2C915370
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x14685B02
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x3254A09B
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x8E15ABE0
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0xBD9A8793
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0xB1B43288
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x7E6E9E72
the bell.
0x60988C04

0xB04A0E33
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x6749C288
the waiter who answered the summons.
0xCE6F1395

0xB04A0E33
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0xFAE077A2
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0xD0B5EA79

0xB04A0E33
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0xDFC670D8

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Person here waiting for you."
0x71E3312B

0xB04A0E33
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x3B40A163
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0xAA93AE0C
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x57F93992

0xB04A0E33
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x622C7AE0
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x0F9807FC

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0xB8EF0E28
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xB7212016
Thornfield.
0xF4FFC901

0xB04A0E33
"A matter of six miles."
0xDAC0CF77

0xB04A0E33
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x91DC167C

0xB04A0E33
"Happen an hour and a half."
0xCDA51095

0xB04A0E33
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x51D6BA2C
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x170ABB2D
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0xC538A55A
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x20825DD8
much at my ease.
0xA0C2F694

0xB04A0E33
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0xD028A651
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0x483D9F76
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0xC5187CA0
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0xE41BC16A
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0x6EE524F6
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0x9BFBCB22
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x1F810535
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x349FA457
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x780E9995
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x82B7238F
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x403F8B54
road now, I wonder?"
0x4DEED61B

0xB04A0E33
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x8E0DEBC6
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0xB3D3F45A
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0x4B5A9F79
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x892F1490
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0xD17BA906
more stirring, less romantic.
0x32969503

0xB04A0E33
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0xAB608B9B
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0xA8295CC1
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x0D7923C3

0xB04A0E33
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x8BAF39DB

0xB04A0E33
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x93AE4A46
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x8884EB93
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x667FD3B8
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0xCBEEC34C
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x367F35F2
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0xB7BB2F89
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x1C1AE927
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0xED53FB8B

0xB04A0E33
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0xB0E43562
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0xC26875EE
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x62C2A2B4
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0xCB47A4F0
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x21E0EE55
itself to my view.
0x3E9E91DE

0xB04A0E33
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0xAA4BFBEE
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x298E8199
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0xB9595459
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0xDA11DDF2
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x547016B2
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x5E991F38
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x01C4E180
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0x4A01C48B
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0xCCC6407B
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x014A23EA

0xB04A0E33
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0x3E742C96
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x8234864D

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x1BF02732

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xC2A0EB64

0xB04A0E33
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0xF6E37DF0
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x345E0D08
trouble.
0xF52B091D

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0xC5A08CB1
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x11E187A4
the keys of the storeroom."
0x667777F0

0xB04A0E33
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0xDB5DEAF4
delivered them to the servant.
0xA58E7ABA

0xB04A0E33
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0xB162A01C
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0xE844EB97

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, ma'am."

0xB04A0E33
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0xEF4C6992

0xB04A0E33
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0x2246C7C3
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x97A9C6D4
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0xC405620E
too soon."
0x46C7E254

0xB04A0E33
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x256B04D0
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x1E18C15E
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x5C8DE73A
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0x4E7CEBC6
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x47D20403
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x3A04237B
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xC478C959

0xB04A0E33
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x3191F0A9
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0x3671B848

0xB04A0E33
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0x4961CE8E
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0xA1E894F2

0xB04A0E33
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x86413CB3

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0xF4B49B6D
future pupil."
0x2CA6EBFC

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0x4444C6CF

0xB04A0E33
"No,--I have no family."
0x5B7AE1BF

0xB04A0E33
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0xC346F2B1
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x3B945B5C
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x51056B00

0xB04A0E33
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x8E18FC00
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xEF9AD046
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0xE3F65779
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x911CE9AC
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x15C3C28C
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0xD5056E30
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x99105385
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0xE71F7578
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0x477FA037
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0xDBC96BF4
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x3F662FBA
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0xFC1AEC7B
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xBF0CB3D3
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x8B8FC732
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0x591A10C7
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x022593EB
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x58C7A304
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0xEBB94EDC
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xC5E3279E

0xB04A0E33
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x2B329A10
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x89D6092B
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0x6CD6620F

0xB04A0E33
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0xE4352E71
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0x27954A6E
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0x4EFB240A
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0xCBE32B73
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x709A975F
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0x1FFEA500
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xE98D8D67

0xB04A0E33
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0xF39F5CE8
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x5A128106
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x4525D844
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xAC326519
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x91A0CA5D
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0x62B60222
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0xF209E075
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x21C97D2B
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0xC38237B3
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0x59525C18
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x2FB2BE54

0xB04A0E33
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0xEBAA7438
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0xE0F6BBF9
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xC47A5AB1
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0xA8E5333F
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0x742D5A8F
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xACAABF64
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x051DBC63
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0x96B588B5
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x3706DBA7
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0x05FA7699
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x7FD5685F
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0xCB583BE8

0xB04A0E33
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0xF879C853
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x4E9840A7
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0xADEFDC20
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0xE2484524
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0x09D9CDD9
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0xD899FE2D
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0x937BB18B
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xE44E5BD9
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x55EF6441
an indefinite future period.
0x45A4B83D

0xB04A0E33
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0xA9F2296E
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0x8FD56ADD
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0xA4034F7B
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0xD49E0F9D
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x417409A2
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0xEBEA9F2F
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xA97ABFF5
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x0D4D0BBE
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x1475E20F
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0x6C19B483
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x31CBF16C
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0xA91F61AC
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x5D5A6C51
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x59966E47
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xC7DCBE00
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0xAC8DA01A
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0xC4318ABC
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x6E62FC35
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x752118ED

0xB04A0E33
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xDCEBB541
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0xF26D5DAB
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x483781DB
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0xC23FCD7F
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0x566325D2
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0x7EC9904A
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x59ED66F6
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0xEBA804CC
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x996E2ACF
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x1BFD71EC
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0xA4D6A2D0
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x491105D5
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0xC3D84C7C
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0xF899D27B
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x0BDE931E
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0xF32EEE8C
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0xF479CC8B
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x54DF6F05
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xBC1403B1
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0xF2C67AC9
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xA4E561B4
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x39ABA059
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0x77521F1A
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0xECB58958
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0x0D326C25
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x66C54376
house and gates.
0x183C55B0

0xB04A0E33
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x4E927441
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x26CA6B83
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x26A95E8A
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0x5B318DA9
appeared at the door.
0x809B66DF

0xB04A0E33
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x76022E47
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x594DDD7C

0xB04A0E33
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x66AD6418
much.
0x21718367

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0xEC3ADB57
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0x6E9A5A36
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x3C03D1AB
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x0757EB2F

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x4D8E635F

0xB04A0E33
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x19A67EBC
was called Rochester?"
0x6AE81368

0xB04A0E33
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xDEB44957
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x2DDE7108
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x20F96C8F

0xB04A0E33
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x390EC533

0xB04A0E33
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x025CB8CA
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x608AD5A7
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x4987986F
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x3D317560
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x584540B6
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x621FA6A2
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0xC24EA598
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0x5C936A3D
expect nothing more."
0x818E407C

0xB04A0E33
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x8CD1E2A6

0xB04A0E33
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x6024AAEE
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x148B21ED
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x799D8677
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0xC849CF78
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xD07B1B2C
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0x5D84832C
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x821B87E8
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x0731D366

0xB04A0E33
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x06BDE6C0
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x99CBDD09
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0xDD4140E2
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0xFC98B1D1
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x55CA5B6F

0xB04A0E33
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x13909897
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x46C64191
approached.
0x861B0A25

0xB04A0E33
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x74716190
nurse; who answered--
0x538AB5BC

0xB04A0E33
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x751FDE9A

0xB04A0E33
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xD2CBA47A

0xB04A0E33
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x1E6EBF15
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xB9E86480
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0xD1935151
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0xD45F581B
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0xB163C01F

0xB04A0E33
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x38F0998B
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x174A8167
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x4DA2514B
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0xA7AD97AD
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x967CCC90
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0xD9194974
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x87DDC2E9
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x6C15BA43
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x9DD86FE0
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0xB322A0C5
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0xAA81A101
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x0B807FAB

0xB04A0E33
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x250E6087
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x2A7FF934
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0xF6C8E587
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x1AF794B2
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0xCFFDF506
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0xEFC225DD
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0xEB0EE182
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x04C85466
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x9A13DBD4

0xB04A0E33
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0xE2572F90

0xB04A0E33
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0xC432229A
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x942F5091
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0x56EAA50D
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0xB515B047
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0xAEA52F8C
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xDD9553B2
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x23246313
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0xA05191B2
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x922B647C
fed with crumbs."
0x4727622E

0xB04A0E33
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x9B6A9DB8

0xB04A0E33
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x9AA32242
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0xDB34BEB1

0xB04A0E33
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x6C292EE7
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x30E8EBE9

0xB04A0E33
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x00AD6C85
clean town you spoke of?"
0xA71AC7A4

0xB04A0E33
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xFCD5D7AA
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x8A73B21E
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x8308B6AC
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0x554A971A
hear me sing now?"
0xB710485A

0xB04A0E33
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x127A911A
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0xFECA45E5
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x80F1604C
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x1061FB45
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x322BE791
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x99C3D16D
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x79E9E193
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0x7C660168
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0xF00C2817
affected her.
0x4FE83320

0xB04A0E33
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x3A77D1BF
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0xD8827086
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x6E299E10
at least I thought so.
0xF359519D

0xB04A0E33
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x674192F6
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x6556B1A7
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x57BAD899

0xB04A0E33
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0xBA55E719
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0xA8C5FE7D
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x5B45D0EE
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x79B270C3
carefully trained.
0x5D822C02

0xB04A0E33
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x504726FC

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0x51C2E17E
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0xAC11EED5
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xC724FB01

0xB04A0E33
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0xBF65788F
say, with whom did you live then?"
0xB4717ACA

0xB04A0E33
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xB7D423CC
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x0B97F267
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0xBD47D47C
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x5EFCCF80
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x5BFE81CB
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0x548270EC
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x8FA0314F
and I never see him."
0xD134C10E

0xB04A0E33
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0x6BCD44DA
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0xC66BABCC
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x78517D49
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x7B699A29
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0x17227497
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x888A9375
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x7DD80467
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x7C2ECAF8
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x92BB384E
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x47FBBA50
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0xA9BEE869
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x960904BA

0xB04A0E33
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x199E9771
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x00A8DC81
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x0516BC2B
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x3244C97E
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0xA395540A
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x7BB17DEC
use.
0x3FB255AC

0xB04A0E33
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0xD58DFB6B
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0x503A4FF9
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0x30B18F32
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x3EC32A92
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0xEB1AF508
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x033F0BB4
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x7465AC8A
sideboard.
0x36E4A655

0xB04A0E33
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0xCCB81005
before seen any half so imposing.
0x4E287893

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x22AF70ED
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0x5099CE4C
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0xED32D87C

0xB04A0E33
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x1774B15D
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x31FD4070
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x0D96F193
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x9887F945
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0xD6344157
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x1B833F2C
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0x0402B747
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0xD9CA2EB3
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x3943D273
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x3B948B4E
general blending of snow and fire.
0x5EB5F335

0xB04A0E33
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x4330FEE0
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x8E651DCF
were inhabited daily."
0xE6A81FE7

0xB04A0E33
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x3FBABCF2
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0xA7C71AA8
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x15DF8C33
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0xB58359D5

0xB04A0E33
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x86DFD8F0

0xB04A0E33
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0x5FACF28A
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x7D10FDE6

0xB04A0E33
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x0BE4E730

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0xDBCD9FCF
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x3BD76F71
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x77D5DEC0

0xB04A0E33
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xB44DECD9
liked for himself?"
0x70A17041

0xB04A0E33
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x9519DB59
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x2F3B8944
lived much amongst them."
0x5A62A170

0xB04A0E33
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x75FA7D77

0xB04A0E33
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x33BC2BA1
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x78B656DE
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x4824B15E
conversation with him."
0x9D614C87

0xB04A0E33
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x50DE41C8

0xB04A0E33
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0x76160188
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x198C2164
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0xEA019B15
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x75A5C6A3
he is a very good master."
0x78C3854F

0xB04A0E33
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0x534642BB
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x98CE5424
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x72BF06F8
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x9E113B80
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0xA23757AA
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x299219DD
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x7BFA1602
definite notion of his identity.
0x470BC59B

0xB04A0E33
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0xB6534443
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0xB6C7CD09
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0x83C0DEF6
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x1F4CB6F6
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x1812F453
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0xB2B608BA
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x8E87849D
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x835003A2
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x4AD2F905
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0x228230A7
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0x37D027A0
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0x92DD9F2D
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x18725D5E
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0x93ACF3ED
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0x38A87E06
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x114F25DC
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0xC97DAEFA
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0xADBEC570
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x489964DE
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x2A2D19D9
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0xCE7E5191

0xB04A0E33
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0xCDB278FF

0xB04A0E33
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x3AB3D4DB
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x36729EF7
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x3AB63674

0xB04A0E33
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0xAF1E2FDD

0xB04A0E33
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0xFAC7BA38

0xB04A0E33
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x4C48A314

0xB04A0E33
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0x6EF88D75
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0x50FC14DD
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0x245CAC32

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x75CF5904
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x777BF5F4

0xB04A0E33
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0xE87E43CF
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x6290B5D1
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x531AE20D
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x8A418742
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0xF948FEC2
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x2E0F62F6
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0xE9A00905
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x1F9ED60B
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0xA12B6798
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x5CA777B9
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x1D0A19E3
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x733B4872
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x5AD2BBBD
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x47A888E4
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x2C2CEE40
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x594D6C3B
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0xCD8F0AF6

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0xBC5288C5
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0xB1AF3DD1
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0xD0FCD812
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x81541E93
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x803349F8
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x34E5E6F3
Bluebeard's castle.
0x991AA7E1

0xB04A0E33
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x97AC3624
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0xD08BC72B
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x97AE05AE
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x9C23CC32
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0xA2B8BF70
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x58B798E3
out the door whence the accents issued.
0xB1AF2DBD

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0xAF7B8806
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x861F1746

0xB04A0E33
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0x0E381944

0xB04A0E33
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0x612E6AD0

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x4B110416
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x00E000DD

0xB04A0E33
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x1439682D
odd murmur.
0x08A29E15

0xB04A0E33
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0xFA5E2FFB

0xB04A0E33
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0x8FF05A15
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x2423C198
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x10D1F8F4
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0x54EA7D32
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0x820CB02B
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0xC306C6E2

0xB04A0E33
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0x6397436B
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0xDF0DB011
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0xE3CDDBF3
be conceived.
0x219FAB51

0xB04A0E33
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xEB5EDC68
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xD5367696

0xB04A0E33
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x8F930C60
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x519F58D0
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0x6207F97A
pupil this morning?"
0xEA7727F3

0xB04A0E33
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0x76733A52
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x73F96465
hall, exclaiming--
0x220933BC

0xB04A0E33
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x9B715F56

0xB04A0E33
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XII
0xC841F3B3

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0xE06E75D9
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x396D1727
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0xADC6970A
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x4FA564BA
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0xCE964CFB
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0xB5EBC982
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0xB2D42711
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x971479D1
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0xE4BE9B8B
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0xC81CAAF1
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0x617AE326
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x876D4D55
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x4F8DD65B
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x69F28B7D
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x28E92538
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0xCEAC3E5C

0xB04A0E33
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0xF8F6F294
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x5332EDAD
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x50918133
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0xB9FC8A01
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0x823FECFA
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0x9B2B20A2
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x10C4A972
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x43A93732
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0xDD799752
of her mind and character.
0x3A4AC708

0xB04A0E33
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x304429D5
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x8EB3C82E
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x0A22443C
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x1E789A08
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0x2532C18C
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0xE76D2ACD
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x42D6BFD2
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0x4D42A7A1
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0xC080CF8B
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0x79BEBCA9
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x2AB8F937
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x5544763A
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0xC6112CD3
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0xEEDD77FA

0xB04A0E33
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x869A37C4
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0xA966A6A5
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x50476837
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x75BF7692
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x9B6799DE
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x44A33EDF
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x6A9F6AB3
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x7F2C6533
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x251DFD05
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0xAB1431B2
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x969DF5FE

0xB04A0E33
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x43256879
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x240A3233
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0xD1963474
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x39B82AF1
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0xC0AB25FD
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x260B4EAF
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x0BEC28E3
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x3F0187E6
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xB2933974
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x0B4F9026
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0xC013BF5C
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0xDA8DE0ED
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x390A367B
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x1DDA9D6E

0xB04A0E33
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x716B8F5F
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x6D7756A4
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0xDEC039D7
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0xA9DA7893
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0xBD4B0DBF
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x21E3820E
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x6BA7A9EB
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0xE9921271
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0xB46A0FF3
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0xB0E02674
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0xCC3DCB6E
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xF2F83F4A
every effort of that sort.
0xCB8DBDBE

0xB04A0E33
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x4BA12F8D
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x13ADE525
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x2B37A301
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0xD8F17B34
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xF1A7FEEF
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0xC168BB84

0xB04A0E33
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x28B040FC
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x8DF9FCF6
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x1A047409
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x132EFE2F
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0xAF69087C
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0xB6AD8F4D
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x9F79825D
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0x90E78209
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0xBE8D01E0
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x52B560C9
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xC83F5857
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x1D1E12BD
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0x87E86FF1
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x4BC3947C
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x0B5F7314

0xB04A0E33
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0xC90E657D
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xB39CC717
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0xB1CE2C24
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0xE2DE9440
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0xA23AF6E6
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0xC81F85A8
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0x5EBC2755
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0x5CA755BE
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xDD44E766
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x2B7A722E
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0x99262775
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x2ACB6EFA
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x6DEBE363
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x6BAACF4A
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x45C58D78

0xB04A0E33
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x9F7208C5
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0x8B6C0869
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x5E1CA61F
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x64F7DAA0
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0xBB48C578
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x9C6AAD67
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x0192503F
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0xEC19560C
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0x13DA5A11
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x43BBE439

0xB04A0E33
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0x453BD764
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x889F08FC
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x9AC6E55A
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x57F05915
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0xEF88415C
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0x2529499F
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x227BE638
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0x60C62D6F

0xB04A0E33
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x76A94D52
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0xEFF3431C
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x35E16793
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x19A14363
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0xC549A9F4
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x562489B3

0xB04A0E33
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0xF90E5D9E
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0xEDA1C2AB
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0x3BC9A2C6
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0xD892630B
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xBAC6B1A2
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x9A340B10
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xA264698D
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x29E0493D
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0x7C316FC5
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0x8DE499D3
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0x6A8C461E
me.
0x6009299D

0xB04A0E33
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x3C64DDDB
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x13823899
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0xCB49D42A
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x2660ACC4
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0xB0BB6A53
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x1538C633
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x8DDC4796
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0x4A96BC2E
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x5B83CCB4
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0xED88C479
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0xEF4DBE64
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x1FE7A261
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x69C2CDC3
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xF00883F8
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0xC437427F
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0xDDB6B9F9
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0xD5A1392D
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x8A4996AE
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x305052C1
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x0565AB5C
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x05DE73F3
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0xF630FBD2
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0xF9A6BBC1

0xB04A0E33
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x1A824920

0xB04A0E33
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x4BE7A032
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0x9BC4436E

0xB04A0E33
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x1B673379

0xB04A0E33
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x0D094322
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0x5E4C2826
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xF716EA34
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x068D45BB
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0xAE697549
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0xF624B8E4
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x14C99CBE
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x9CED64EE
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0xD1D2BE4A

0xB04A0E33
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x50CA43A2
now drew near him again.
0x9A16649C

0xB04A0E33
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xC82F9A73
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0x82F979EC

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0xD77C1C6C
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x6AC51421
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xDE17867F

0xB04A0E33
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0xF4A09D63
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xC1F2690E
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x6E2C4090
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x96D1B91E
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0xD3BB2DA5
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x31FE8458
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x74DEEE8E
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x77B74D7E
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0x7C01A12A
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x55B2A0D4
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x898C50E6
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0xD1CACF06
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x4EAEB937
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0xEFA0D88B
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x9CF83E9C
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0xECB13E56

0xB04A0E33
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x7BF78D1F
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0xA61EF516
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0xDA53A172
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0xE7D8AC00
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0xB024DECC

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0x7326B756
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0x18D4F046

0xB04A0E33
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x32D07267
direction before.
0x3FF1FC68

0xB04A0E33
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x3B7D2771
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0xD86E0BE8

0xB04A0E33
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0xEB829F17
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0x43697A17
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0x1A6F2E9D

0xB04A0E33
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0xF5ED3E73
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x36683B35
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x48C72774
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0xBD34993E

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Whose house is it?"
0x64179174

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x09D8CD7F

0xB04A0E33
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0x1F88B2B5

0xB04A0E33
"No, I have never seen him."
0xE1EF8600

0xB04A0E33
"He is not resident, then?"
0x13EABD66

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0xBD54ECAC

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot."
0x5B5B00AC

0xB04A0E33
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0xB700EAD7
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x94548E6B
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x866FAE3F
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x7D8243CE

0xB04A0E33
"I am the governess."
0x78DD3D5F

0xB04A0E33
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x2133726C
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x7C258348
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x0559D6FE

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0xFCBE934D
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0xF562A0AF

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0x11180F74

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0x8F6D2A14
afraid?"
0x4B25F550

0xB04A0E33
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x18119ADE
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0x8F848D19
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0x4A00F2A0
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x0662239F
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x1EE30E34
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0x58E128C4
he laughed.
0xAA464B76

0xB04A0E33
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0xBC113E04

0xB04A0E33
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0x047DF0D3
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x45014429
come here."
0x90EBBB97

0xB04A0E33
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x99ECA35D
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xE88EBF60
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x2CFD5B78
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0x9A9D1D76
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0xF65FA900

0xB04A0E33
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0xCC24D371
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x9725E060

0xB04A0E33
I sought it and found it.
0xC6ABD819

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0xC6B63ECB
you can."
0x687EFE35

0xB04A0E33
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x73CDD1AA
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xC1F099C5

0xB04A0E33
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0xF76E153E
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xDFFA50AC

0xB04A0E33
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0xE37A15A7
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x08B4C5E4
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x60B76C17
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0x5D5243F6
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xEB69244E
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x3CA2F4EE
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0xD3856F13
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0xC4F34927
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x607AF728
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x5F375E7A
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x3D9B1CA9
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x9186D2B6
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x9DE61474
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x485C36DC
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0xC6A7B961
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x37F4B991
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0xD19B95C6
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x0FFCC3CC
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0x4CBB9511
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xA3148542

0xB04A0E33
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0xAC7FF084
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0x330F39F5
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xF7834A2E
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x7EB11672
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x7FBB23C9
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0xF6F2A297
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0x6B851598
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x45D6D196
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x8D7ACD13
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x0FA009CF
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x93044581
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x179CA3BA
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0xB8E652F1
as it would be under his.
0xEBB4341F

0xB04A0E33
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xB5CC5282
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x6CAC2C9C
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0xC96DC63D
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x03BA57C1
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0xE0A68CEE
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0x290B6194
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x2B0E1718
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xF49B32E1
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0x84ACC6CA
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xB481C03C
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0xDFC2C528
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0xF152331E
door, and went in.
0x27330BC8

0xB04A0E33
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x8021CE54
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0x23C4BCF5
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x440025AA
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x6CC3D2DC
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0xB9543E6E
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x632A1D05
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x3BC5A455
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0xFF81615C
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x466EAC05

0xB04A0E33
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0xD2BDE706
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x73090552
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x7F3E8DE3
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0x4C8227C2
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x540F1B3C
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x2D380972
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x3F782E9C
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0xA66FAEB4
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x75B8D557

0xB04A0E33
"What dog is this?"
0xBF65661F

0xB04A0E33
"He came with master."
0x2C43CF23

0xB04A0E33
"With whom?"
0xE1968AE4

0xB04A0E33
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x37CAE420

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xA06913E9

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0xBF819BFD
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0xBF4810CF
sprained."
0x2E030DB6

0xB04A0E33
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x61E8B599

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x5DF2EDBD

0xB04A0E33
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0xED04A9D6

0xB04A0E33
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0xBAE67885
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0xCDD7600A
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0xAD1F41A3
upstairs to take off my things.
0x75B078FA

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XIII
0xAE2E3CCD

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x861579DC
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x521DD09A
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xCF7EB0A5
and waiting to speak with him.
0x9B9E27EC

0xB04A0E33
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x0AE841E0
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x26DC854C
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0x0B2344CE
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x3DA59CD4
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0xC7875CBE
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x95C6DA02
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0x239661D9
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x87A4FA1B
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x721AD185

0xB04A0E33
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x2EC6643C
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x7C0B7C75
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x71995C8B
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x54B3EACC
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0x9DF99039
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x3423A9F5
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x04566408
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0xD04BF78E
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0xE94E027B
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x7C45BEB2
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x4B065702

0xB04A0E33
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x5A4E3DA5
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0xEB0C54B6
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0xC1B7B789
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x2BB6FACF
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x4528A663

0xB04A0E33
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xDEFD79C5
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x64D130AE
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x3DCBF2B1
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x586C59A7
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x24A97EC4
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0xED248396
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0xB8D12E81
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xF7EA2A6B
fireside.
0x3488A4BF

0xB04A0E33
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0xCAD24D73
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x6CB655C1
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0xF69DB11D
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0xE572F77A
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0xECE14676

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0xCE9154DB
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x00CE2E5B
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x0884AB81

0xB04A0E33
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0x8EB1C365

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x1D33D1A5
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x758712D9
candle."
0x78AD6B54

0xB04A0E33
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x4AE8D6DA

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x9D1A166B
is here."
0xC1BE7A5E

0xB04A0E33
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0x5DBEADAC
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0xE700D845
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x48E623C6
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0xDB67F659
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0xCB243CB4

0xB04A0E33
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0xA9E036E8
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0xB1305B14
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x626F9CE3
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xE2A5015C
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0x871A627E
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0xCC9F144B
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0xF1EACEF4

0xB04A0E33
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0xA2347910
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x02B87A80
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x72278FC6
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0xA13E33E0
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x822E5294
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0xD2F78110
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x9C4E3DBE
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x5A22178C
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x9F3540C7
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0x6937FCDB
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x1916EFEE
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x38194EA9
neither tall nor graceful.
0x0D340F58

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x421F952A
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0x12FFD2DF
lifted his head as we approached.
0xC95F41C5

0xB04A0E33
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0x9A9DA6C7
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0xC9FFBE83

0xB04A0E33
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0xDEB0E200
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x19DBF129
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x7273FB5C
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0xF9714812

0xB04A0E33
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x6A1B1F22
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x79B6468A
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x0F128D19
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0xCDFEB5AB
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0xB2E27EEB
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x17CE14EB

0xB04A0E33
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xBA8053BC
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0xF59147E6
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0x7A235F80
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x49DF9714
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0xAC59FA24
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0xEEE38E8C

0xB04A0E33
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0xDD47B91D
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x3E67F657
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0xFB36924C
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xC7164D5D

0xB04A0E33
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x3455220C
might perhaps spill it."
0xC33DC03D

0xB04A0E33
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x3D8E0A08
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x87080AFC

0xB04A0E33
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x7497DAEE
votre petit coffre?"
0x04CDBD3A

0xB04A0E33
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0xA09B60E2
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x841A2A0B
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x36511789

0xB04A0E33
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0xC51D14A2
thought pleasant things."
0x9C9C16E3

0xB04A0E33
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x76FD4BA0

0xB04A0E33
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x4FA5823C
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x3B807929
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xBA985DC4
nature."
0xC45CF5F5

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0x0EC45E15
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x7931FC5F

0xB04A0E33
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0xA04295A8
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x55FA590C
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0xCE975A68
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0xFB2EA49E
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0xE3A4E7AB

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0xB9FC4435
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xCBD9D388
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0x40DE26B6

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x9FEFD53B
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x331F2B7D

0xB04A0E33
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0xF7B547F5

0xB04A0E33
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x80325ACE
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0xD592ABE1
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x42B77976
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xEBC11D07
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x583C4DFF
amuse herself with Pilot.
0xB0A44033

0xB04A0E33
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0xE5DCCAE7

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And you came from--?"
0xD06CB8D8

0xB04A0E33
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xAEABE23C

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x72409D6B

0xB04A0E33
"Eight years."
0xD7EB6B86

0xB04A0E33
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x4B5C86E5
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x37FE6F02
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0xBF58E324
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x8C1DE7AB
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x45613D91
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xA35DA8C1

0xB04A0E33
"I have none."
0x38087BCE

0xB04A0E33
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x850E700F

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0x087E828D
that stile?"
0x991E832A

0xB04A0E33
"For whom, sir?"
0x6064DD9A

0xB04A0E33
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0xA4D1C3B3
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0xAF2D6C3F
causeway?"
0x6600AFCF

0xB04A0E33
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xE1F8257B
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0xB477BB4A
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x736C0F80
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x4B025F5E
revels more."
0x3350D1BD

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xF7EAEB67
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x994BCBCF

0xB04A0E33
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x679BC58D
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x0E901BE9

0xB04A0E33
"No; none that I ever saw."
0xD730D361

0xB04A0E33
"And your home?"
0xDADA2152

0xB04A0E33
"I have none."
0x38087BCE

0xB04A0E33
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0xACF5527B

0xB04A0E33
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0xBBC43B08

0xB04A0E33
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0x29BEA68F

0xB04A0E33
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xF2C06B72

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x46F4FAF7
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x7AABFABE
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x90EBED1A
Adele."
0x761A0776

0xB04A0E33
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0xF032A317
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x71971A98
felling my horse."
0xC924FD66

0xB04A0E33
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x4EC37DBE

0xB04A0E33
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0x0340E6CA

0xB04A0E33
The widow looked bewildered.
0x9D949251

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0xFBF1995E

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir."
0x8E39E21C

0xB04A0E33
"Have you seen much society?"
0xDFD20B78

0xB04A0E33
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0xAF4D9260
Thornfield."
0x5E4C0D0E

0xB04A0E33
"Have you read much?"
0x120FFEDB

0xB04A0E33
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0xA35DEDA7
very learned."
0x29F70F88

0xB04A0E33
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0xDE5B4F34
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0x1556A54C
parson, is he not?"
0x8798EE90

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0x1C0BF14D
would worship their director."
0xB4BF910A

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, no."
0x0AA288E7

0xB04A0E33
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x8C70D5EB
sounds blasphemous."
0x7B2648CF

0xB04A0E33
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x097F3BF4
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0xA72C9608
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0xD6CF6358
hardly sew."
0xB96D0950

0xB04A0E33
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x61AE56C3
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0xAB0703EE

0xB04A0E33
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0x6C288436
Rochester.
0xA9F141D6

0xB04A0E33
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0x61BBA1F4
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x7E0F801B
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x70103630
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0x0F163C6F
to bed."
0x70DE233A

0xB04A0E33
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0xCDA8D9AE

0xB04A0E33
"About ten."
0x6E9D5710

0xB04A0E33
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0xE1B8C5B8

0xB04A0E33
I assented.
0x9FB154CA

0xB04A0E33
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x89A37D6E
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x6AC9CD0C
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xE52ED1C5
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0x0369090D

0xB04A0E33
"A little."
0x0FA1CA48

0xB04A0E33
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0xD280D0C0
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x4976AB36
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xEC0A9A5B
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x1A4CF325
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xFE2B8033

0xB04A0E33
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x7504E6C7

0xB04A0E33
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x47255704
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0x35F7627B
not well."
0x687704B3

0xB04A0E33
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0xFDC7AA59
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x63C0E041
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0x3EFF632C

0xB04A0E33
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x3449E20C

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0xF9274EA5
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x41509D32
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0xF71131FF

0xB04A0E33
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0x965F213A

0xB04A0E33
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x90D74582

0xB04A0E33
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x3AB4E466
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x517DB1A2

0xB04A0E33
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0xFCAC2BEB
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x26C5898A

0xB04A0E33
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x5DD0067E
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0xCA30DD45

0xB04A0E33
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0x2FE1A894
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x8262229E
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x90BF1B78
hand yours?"
0xAFFEFFDF

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x4309955E
some thought."
0x50A45DF6

0xB04A0E33
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0x31905C91
other occupation."
0xDD22EF7D

0xB04A0E33
"Where did you get your copies?"
0x0361616F

0xB04A0E33
"Out of my head."
0x111FED42

0xB04A0E33
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x0958AADB

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0x0576DB65

0xB04A0E33
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0x8FC83CA3

0xB04A0E33
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0x325084AB

0xB04A0E33
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0x8ED38CFC
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xAC62019A
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0x34BAE811
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x4B60B086
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0xA17A42AB
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x921AAB5F

0xB04A0E33
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x51AC571C
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0xA34CC042
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xB7E4D534
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x949972C1
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x15F81587
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xA2FE4E56
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x3C474F41
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0x910E1DF9
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x12D8700A
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x01AC9D27

0xB04A0E33
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x10E97C3B
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x46508E06
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0xA4FE547A
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x4FB3E3ED
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0xE358AE88
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x60A76846
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0x980AE353
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x087B4922
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x86632E69
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0x6FFE606F

0xB04A0E33
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x368CFECA
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0xDD54886C
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x6AC763AB
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0x6FCB295F
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0x5F508B56
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0xBC467573
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x351A800D
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x2191A98A
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x6BC047EF
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0xD7CFE623
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x22B89FFB
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xAF703D3D

0xB04A0E33
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x2B020579
presently.
0xF30B9A62

0xB04A0E33
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0xF0FBC656
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x5E8414FA

0xB04A0E33
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x39F4D542
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x2C5AEEB0
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0xEA0E0D5A
each day?"
0xC907FBB8

0xB04A0E33
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x4539C390
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0xF8F96208
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0x5688D5B0

0xB04A0E33
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0x6301C187

0xB04A0E33
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x5F84CFDA
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x297521A2
powerless to realise."
0x175E0E31

0xB04A0E33
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x6551263E
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0x0A880F25
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x756A0A9D
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x4D0C78A8
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0xD78D8C66
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x07E2A887
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0xA3257C17
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0xA41CD765
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x0873741F

0xB04A0E33
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x5514DC2B
watch, he said abruptly--
0x919FD8A8

0xB04A0E33
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x82DED1F2
so long?  Take her to bed."
0x5ECC02BA

0xB04A0E33
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0xAF2F1279
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0x280EBE91
much.
0x21718367

0xB04A0E33
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0xDFD875AC
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x536D0EC4
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x6831EDC2
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x202A0065

0xB04A0E33
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0xE81BBD39
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x347EE43F

0xB04A0E33
"Well, is he?"
0x6B87D62C

0xB04A0E33
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x619E588C

0xB04A0E33
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0x38EC505A
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0x28602A28
temper, allowance should be made."
0x768E0349

0xB04A0E33
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0xB04A0E33
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x5E10BE00
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0xA2BDEEDA
make his spirits unequal."
0x8FAF9E04

0xB04A0E33
"What about?"
0x7D9F3AF8

0xB04A0E33
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0x858B3DF2

0xB04A0E33
"But he has no family."
0x239D1923

0xB04A0E33
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x3C77890F
brother a few years since."
0x475540BC

0xB04A0E33
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x4DCCFCBE

0xB04A0E33
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x07715A7A
the property; only about nine years."
0xEE8FE03B

0xB04A0E33
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xDA804719
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x273AD1B1

0xB04A0E33
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x8B5D6ACA
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0xEEB7B8E2
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0xA823A578
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x3902F047
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x32B6B1DD
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x7DCB478D
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x5A5A4C5C
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0xAAD69FA0
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0x1F4B187A
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0xF3A38AB1
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0xB7ECFD22
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x84AC71F0
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x973AE907
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0xD15C07C4
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x17C35C11
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0xAA737C67

0xB04A0E33
"Why should he shun it?"
0xDB50FF8F

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x76FDBB60

0xB04A0E33
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0xC894C362
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xFE9D9D87
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x30F1C307
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x7617767B
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x4F01C0B3
subject, which I did accordingly.
0xEF98D2C4

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XIV
0x1DA369C7

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xC295830E
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0xF2C8C102
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xDFB454D1
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x650458D9
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x88849541
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x08054DEC

0xB04A0E33
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0xDF4FEF00
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x55181605
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0xBC72271C
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0xEC8FFD62
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0xC09B99B2
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xBA1A7D24
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0xC5A9F347
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x69D41AD4

0xB04A0E33
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x3C85F2EB
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0xC7B96611
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xFD69BDFF
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x113A4B70
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0x6D64F965
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0x6F9E173F
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0xA112DA98
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0x9642C67B
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x96E48B00
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0xDB82C50B
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x0B3512B4
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0xFE992C08
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x28C0A1FF

0xB04A0E33
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x18A90DE2

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x3BA16C69
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x529E14C3
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x528639C4
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x77A6CC66
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x0F40F828
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x53083CBA
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x74CCE748

0xB04A0E33
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x1915BAD7
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x0E0BCF67
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xE2270FE9
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x3C61258C

0xB04A0E33
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xA9022F13
contemplation.
0xAF60A132

0xB04A0E33
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0xCCB57093
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x0CB4814B

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x34F6F9C7
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x6ED2779A
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xAD28A26B
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0xFB738B1A
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0xCF901DA0
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x92CC1A96
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x4C2A885C
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0xE6181058
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x50137503
said to be thicker than water."
0x101901A1

0xB04A0E33
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0xEABBFAAA
knitting-basket in hand.
0x3DD908BE

0xB04A0E33
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x6412677D
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0xDA61B6C3
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xEC239D06
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xF426F3D1
performed."
0xF8BA6C79

0xB04A0E33
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x52D01DFC
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x684E4AEA
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x6A31E8C0
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x765E066F

0xB04A0E33
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x9BE9C1EB
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0xF9AD9557
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0xCB12D259
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0xC8EAA140
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0x9CA12F6D
mind to do."
0x81EC44BC

0xB04A0E33
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0xCFF31C79
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xE779DC5B
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x57EE5C39

0xB04A0E33
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0x5838F07E
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0x5778A144
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x211DE2CC
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0xFCC29A9B
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x5BA0970F
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0x4D236D58

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x43C23AFB
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x7B691724
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x33EA183B
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x99CC06E5
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x93D2C681
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x81190647
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xAC1AE5B3
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0xAB5178F2
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0xC1690DB0
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x4E41A282
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x63B9B284
feeling.
0x9D520970

0xB04A0E33
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x57EF5DA3
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x46AEE9D1
fastened on his physiognomy.
0x90772592

0xB04A0E33
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x3112B977

0xB04A0E33
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x17A0AB80
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0xC53864FE
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x47458FA0

0xB04A0E33
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x78F0D1FC
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x941E942C
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x627B6A01
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x6464DDBD
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x30B0FCC0
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x261F25DD
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xD4615CD4

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x58C5234F
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0xE1F0DDD2
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xF2FDB22B
consequence, or something of that sort."
0x6D038460

0xB04A0E33
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0xEDF60981
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0xFA974EBD
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x4B547D39
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0xEA742484
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xD6501AD9

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xD77BE358
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x29D2C079

0xB04A0E33
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x20E81BAF
does my forehead not please you?"
0x17A76C08

0xB04A0E33
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x499356EF
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x9C71E9B4
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x2D76878E

0xB04A0E33
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x85BA4B0B

0xB04A0E33
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x4F3DD4BA
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x5A2CF90A

0xB04A0E33
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x8DD278A6
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0x9F6146A7
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x65C76B89
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0xCFAF3F59
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0x2F438A8B
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0xC7A2965B
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0x0CD3E411
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x52022A7A
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0xC02298F2
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x19BDC93E
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0xAFE067BF
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0xD564BAF3
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x77F8FA83
me?"
0x774A49E6

0xB04A0E33
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x4FB8408B

0xB04A0E33
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0x25680999

0xB04A0E33
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x70A7712C
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x759496A1
capable of being re-transformed?
0x2A604837

0xB04A0E33
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x5A86CC39
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x13CEE261
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xDA5DDE93
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0xB891A52C
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x7E4DB132
to-night."
0x99AA87AC

0xB04A0E33
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0xC5720DC8
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x3305FB94
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x2DF6900E
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x294C0766
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0xB2A85D79
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x6750C817
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x11AE069D
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x00E1332C
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0xBF161EEA
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x14105C85
confidence.
0x0186A2C5

0xB04A0E33
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x251C4BD9
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0xA869EE49
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xD9EE3D44
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x6E6B6CD6
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x3AA69CE3
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0x3894F012
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x3889A3BD
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x785A7102
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xADEAFC3E
you--therefore speak."
0x303EA80C

0xB04A0E33
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0xCA79BDF2
smile either.
0x6404AFF8

0xB04A0E33
"Speak," he urged.
0x3BCB30EC

0xB04A0E33
"What about, sir?"
0x17391FE6

0xB04A0E33
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xBBC24691
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x309F29E4

0xB04A0E33
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x3DC56E3D
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0x0B6EDC37
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xC71386FA

0xB04A0E33
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xDC08906B

0xB04A0E33
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xAA2E45B9
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x5E8BD9A7

0xB04A0E33
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0x2B94F4A8
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x15A306E7
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0xDAACA5F4
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0x0D5807C0
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x39771B86
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xFCE2B759
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x0F32384D
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0xC56778BB
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0xBBFCA129
rusty nail."
0x1FD33F31

0xB04A0E33
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0xA178FFF7
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x6EA5B64E

0xB04A0E33
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0xA6D907B6
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x0E2C9961
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0xE19CD7DA

0xB04A0E33
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x3C438B7D
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0xEC2963BC
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x7F8D7724
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x1F596C6E
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x685556E9
people in one house?"
0x18CA24B3

0xB04A0E33
"Do as you please, sir."
0x4D6C4F2B

0xB04A0E33
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0xD7B4497A
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0xECC17E28

0xB04A0E33
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0xE62FFC19
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x3B238778
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x95AF386A
and experience."
0x727F38DB

0xB04A0E33
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x5C6E50A2
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x5B1BB266
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x825334E8
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x06DE1B72
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xCCDDC199

0xB04A0E33
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xF7978837
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0xCB114452

0xB04A0E33
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0xECED238B
expression; "but speak too."
0x3866A047

0xB04A0E33
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0xACE95234
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0x78BEA25B
their orders."
0xB64F8DB7

0xB04A0E33
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xF7CA1C5B
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x56E0B52A
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0xBF57A94D

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x0B46AB1D
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xCACF1E8E
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x69AB6A47

0xB04A0E33
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0xDB666B12
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0x94AE87C7

0xB04A0E33
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xC41340F4
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x3F24B245
salary."
0x2A67F650

0xB04A0E33
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x5335FE9F
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0xE5CA89C2
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0xAF7AD06A
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x8A9CF92F
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x288AEE1B
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0xAAA7A6FE
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x1CAF852C
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xAC2E83FD
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0xBC8E7429
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0xE9E6B4CC
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0xE4578E7A
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x3E0E439A
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0xAC8814D0
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0xB4D135A4

0xB04A0E33
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x63354283
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0xDAFB24E6
as well as imagined--
0x7794CCC1

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0xC5686A32
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x52489ACE
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0x8BB5876C
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x7736C684
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0x3B313799
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0xCA72D565
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x97F1513B
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0xCCF60FDF
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0xD517F2B4
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x8048E21D
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x46F76CE6
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0xC1A65125
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x5793CAEA

0xB04A0E33
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x7B176C0A

0xB04A0E33
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x204DCA6C
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x29E387EF
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x0659D716
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x5AF90DB3
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xF2A26B33
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0x7DA4503D
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x6BBE8080
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0xBB4BBA9D
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x8B1A1772
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xEAF04A3E
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x92612785
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xE95F9C26
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x160E2831
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0xD545E018
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0xB4A3E246
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0xF1C2DDF6
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0x2B8C3B69
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0x304EF454

0xB04A0E33
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0xAFC434BA

0xB04A0E33
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0x540DFDA5
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0xBDC25700
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x8231C44E
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x5CABBC56
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0x17367833
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x5CA4E918
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0x6A133DFF
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0xCAB9AE65
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x97B3315A

0xB04A0E33
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x1FD45440

0xB04A0E33
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0x54865BBD
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0xD20E04F0
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0xED7845AB
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0xF872B792
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0xBDBEA399

0xB04A0E33
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0xE64B75F1

0xB04A0E33
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0x0753C8A8
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0xDEF15EED
moor."
0x0847A561

0xB04A0E33
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0x028449FA

0xB04A0E33
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0x6253E5A3
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0xB1E246F0
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0xC1E060E0
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0xED97E895
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0x9CF96CA1

0xB04A0E33
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x04B52874
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0x96691B71

0xB04A0E33
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x08EACC0F
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0xA702EF39
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0xCC16399D
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0xDC0C35FC
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0x887A7CB1
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0x095CAC83

0xB04A0E33
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0x5DC0859B

0xB04A0E33
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0x74617A00
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0x62DC3D9B
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0xFDE4DAD7

0xB04A0E33
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0x6207206A
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0xC3E81F55
misery if you listen to it."
0x5232F019

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0xE53685FB
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0x0656265C
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0xA82F901B

0xB04A0E33
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x8C030AF2
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0x2D1CDAB8
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0xA41693A2

0xB04A0E33
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0xF8C16E1F
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0xA6A7305B
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x95772909

0xB04A0E33
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0x98114687
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x30D0EAD0
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0xA0C46F29
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0x895719A5
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0xE04DE8D1
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0xFE5B1D65
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0xF470E5AE
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0x8F4E296E
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0xAD8B8C32
which you might revert with pleasure."
0xDEF6F1E2

0xB04A0E33
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0xE2BFA6AD
paving hell with energy."
0x226ECEF1

0xB04A0E33
"Sir?"
0x4A6427AA

0xB04A0E33
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0xBC58A013
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0xB6467954
been."
0xD1DFDECA

0xB04A0E33
"And better?"
0x103B1EBF

0xB04A0E33
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0x4BED4281
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0x7568EBF6
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0x58994F85
and Persians, that both are right."
0x932CF11D

0xB04A0E33
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0xD560BAA7

0xB04A0E33
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0x946BA64C
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0x5BBF8DAF

0xB04A0E33
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0xD15B2375
is liable to abuse."
0x980AB224

0xB04A0E33
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0x76ED5E2E
abuse it."
0x54BCA5F2

0xB04A0E33
"You are human and fallible."
0x7D7E3D63

0xB04A0E33
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0xD3DB0FB5

0xB04A0E33
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0x5CABE53E
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0x3F4DD019

0xB04A0E33
"What power?"
0xF2D2A158

0xB04A0E33
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x58079530
right.'"

0xB04A0E33
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0x40FCFFF6

0xB04A0E33
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0xBE448D29
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0xFD3F7E6E
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0xA265E073
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0x2BCD0376
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0x49B5D2D2

0xB04A0E33
"Where are you going?"
0x6E377895

0xB04A0E33
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xFF3CA48D

0xB04A0E33
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0xB1AFF361

0xB04A0E33
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0x7A03979D
certainly not afraid."
0x7FEAAF54

0xB04A0E33
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0xD1E6365A

0xB04A0E33
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0x79EBDA47

0xB04A0E33
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0xB95BC6F9
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0xEA1EF71D
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0xABB7699D
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0xBE81E69A
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0xAB2CEE97
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0xCB67D946
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0xA42B83B9
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x06C3E565
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0x6A7CE446
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0xD14B6470
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0x2C88F98A
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x202EB6F3
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0x3A26B175
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0x450BAC54

0xB04A0E33
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x4D18EECE

0xB04A0E33
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0x82581980
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0x5B003BC4
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0xC1D98A81
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0xB2702DEE
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0x263096F2
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0xCC6CBBF4
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0x6266C43D
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0x6381EC87
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0xC108230B
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x0F89DA70
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0x5898E1F7
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0xAC7900BF
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0xF2C1CFD1
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x7B867635
will be realised."
0x63EA79D5

0xB04A0E33
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0x14CB8DF2
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x41FEBC97
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0x0AB19258
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0xD2C79FAA
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0xC570F1D2
and small white satin sandals.
0xE8EBCC84

0xB04A0E33
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0x0695C7C3
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0xA9862C2B

0xB04A0E33
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0x5A895F6D
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0x20E20B24
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0x455535B2

0xB04A0E33
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x271C3990
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0x337C104D

0xB04A0E33
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x18F30D83
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0x5B899F1E
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x251451BA
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x4184007A
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0xF1BFC7E0
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0xF87C2CB6
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x210A7BBD
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xC2E3EEE3
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0x4397BB3E
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0xC4D95B7F
Good-night."

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XV
0x230AFA06

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0xE948B339
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0xDD9EBDB2
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0x339F4ED6
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0x12B52D11

0xB04A0E33
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0xC1F7E56F
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x497E8989
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x1D4231DE
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0xF8306256
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0xA171C01D
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x8B88D784

0xB04A0E33
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0xFAB88F9D
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x7370CF3B
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xE137EEA6
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x6B1108D4
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0xDF40448B
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0xC4B24F2D
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0x79CA747B
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xF5B80B76
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0xEACAD4B9
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0x3986C0B4
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x1B43A672
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0xF0E56D37
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0xC401B665
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0xC4182833
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x1F11F07E
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x6FD80C4B
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x58CCB680
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xCA35779D
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0xB6C9E5B2
now, if you will excuse me."
0x897F8EAF

0xB04A0E33
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x03554C59
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x3AB5CBBD
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x698A88A7

0xB04A0E33
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0xA50BA77E
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x762E0938
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0xF0519923
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x08E2021C
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xBB70262E
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0x55300FF7
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0xDE9DB659
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xF604B493
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0x224D779A
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0xF0A32E6D
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0xE454E75B
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x45BE82DB
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0xD0C42BC4
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0xE0693A86
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x6C408B53
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xFF70FEAE
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x4EE1BBFA
cochere_ of the hotel.
0xE08B6CA4

0xB04A0E33
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0xBE46B707
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x9D17C180
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xD6C250B3
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x51255FA6
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xB62F0D9B
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0xCC6C9226
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x44A18CCA
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0xED849E1E
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x9287847C
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0xE2D879A4
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x17E8AF4E
current--as I am now.
0xE39BE094

0xB04A0E33
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0xF46A3E62
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xD585EDE6
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0xC35DFEB5
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x5C98264C
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x06F76830
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0x880BFBBC

0xB04A0E33
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0xC18E67ED
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x132AFECC
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0x136F865D

0xB04A0E33
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x23F14554
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x8ECF963A
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x040F439F
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x93A940CD
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x962982E4
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x947F2AAF
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xB1970FFE
his countenance: he went on--
0x3754C892

0xB04A0E33
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x640C758A
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0xF0E47BA2
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0xE60B3D6B
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x52C07082
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x11D95941
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0xE6431445
if you dare!'
0x01A134A8

0xB04A0E33
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x4A96F795
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x009FE10F
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x7CBACF36
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0xAB22DD83
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xA50CA3A2
but straw and rotten wood."
0xCA780F24

0xB04A0E33
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x7DB5BD8F
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x074E536C
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x669755CE
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0x4F83DBD1

0xB04A0E33
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x9DF22EA5

0xB04A0E33
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0xFC7CACEF
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x60FFB58F
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0x0854346D
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0x19C8A363
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0xCBF84F44
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x6374C262
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x1AC43937
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0xBF4E6FD3
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0xB3C1B6E2
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xE863C92C
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x61B74494
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x8E348F97
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x44554943
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0x81A509E0
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0xD3302597
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x9B66E9BB
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0xC5D37E8A
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x847DA23E
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0xB2BE7F85
After this digression he proceeded--
0x69C3BA55

0xB04A0E33
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x76DE5EAC
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0xD5BC0245
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0xD63F1A50
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0xF9C04B27
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0x600FE9E0
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x243DDF63
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0x1A8713A6
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0xD84E9E81
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x4242471A
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x4F853413
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x6271F65B
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xB89D6727
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x32AE1E07
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xCEA0A6BD
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0xA3D3401E
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0xFB5512D9
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0x09C8DCD8
who had been her dupe.
0x6189B476

0xB04A0E33
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xA68CBEC1
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0xCFC6BA05
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x789CFD96
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x7482FB87
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0xCA5BCB0F
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xD2BC6A24
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x43BC3C04
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0x36DB1696
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x481AE512
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x9D7FFFA4
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0x33E7FD15

0xB04A0E33
Adele here came running up again.
0x37E34F73

0xB04A0E33
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0xB68B8E43
wishes to see you."
0x191871FF

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x68C24BEB
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x27D7A07D
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x1B52BAFC
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xBAB2854A
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0x6846F474
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0xE1A903D8
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x694D3E1F
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0xD8233BB3
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x43702D64
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xDA1B70DC
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xC58A8E75
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x3F1D936C
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0xC043F257
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0xE9350C32
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0xA99A9398
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x97DFA9F4
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0xC4FC8979
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0x0245B42A
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xC03BE906
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0xD101A2DB
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0x3E525D53
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x54FD2BB2

0xB04A0E33
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x6D4FFAC0
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0x31BA9998
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x845735EB
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0x593BCC82
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x54625241
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x57E3F94C

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x14B7C689
you too: it darkens."
0xFB55773B

0xB04A0E33
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0x7BDC2DF9
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0xBC08ED75
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x0B0916BF
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x66DFCFA8
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0x2533C1E3
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x2894EE0B
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x8865A0FB
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x38D759CC
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0x3FD15E07
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0x9BA45104
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0xA3BEF1C7
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0x3DEBFCAB

0xB04A0E33
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x7D4269EB
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0xF60E9E6C
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x73267A70
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x5DB5D08F
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x8766A04E
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x68F095A8
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0xA49F6835
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0x010FB275
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x8F738538
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0xF8688D5E
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x6F127C28
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x62ADBA4F
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xFEA18562
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x929CF067
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x2B9B10C6
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x12CC6D99
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x140F48A1
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x10C60F88
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x80E740CE
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0x46DEB781
benefit.
0x12270666

0xB04A0E33
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0xD900F006
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0x99E4C7CB
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0xDA4F87D0
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0x8556BD7B
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x37AA576F
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xFDA9180A
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0xB5DABED0
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x51016B03
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0xDC603310

0xB04A0E33
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x633DFE19
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x6D71B1E0
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x41C5B087
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xC5244FBF
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0x061EBEE0
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x02C47061
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xBC628088
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0xF8B2B6D0

0xB04A0E33
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0xA97B141A
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x7B41FB08
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0xE62A0386
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x3FC67A9F
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xE7B6E647
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x6A60837D
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xD94862BA
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0xC4C8C581
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0x11A06EBA
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0xF6945B3E
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x4F91F383
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0xB4AF3691
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0xD645A7DF
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0x05828A64
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0xDC04D7AE
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xB51E81F2
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x608CACC0
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0xE7375217
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x0B01CD87

0xB04A0E33
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0xE09E4E9E
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0xDA2B044E
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0x90030CEA
Thornfield.
0xF4FFC901

0xB04A0E33
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0xB004C729
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x142A7CE9
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0xC50A931F
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x728D9630
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0xADB9478C

0xB04A0E33
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x583BA9A6
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x30D3B12F
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0x903019E7
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x28DC3E0A
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x8F21C6E2

0xB04A0E33
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x3351D00C
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x1051B8CE
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x0685E5D8
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x442477BA
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x3485D3B8

0xB04A0E33
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0x1F96D054
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x03BECCE1
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x42054ACC
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x63E7D83E
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xD1237F5A
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0xFF25868A
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xCF2FF13B
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0xCDB2587C
enough.
0x86EA28A8

0xB04A0E33
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x7D435915
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x7AE99D3B
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x425E8CE7
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0xC769E652
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x74A197D6
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xF4824D3D
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0x70337933
there?"
0x4AD41237

0xB04A0E33
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0xA04DB2F4
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x3ECC147D
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x755729A7

0xB04A0E33
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0xCB259C1E
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0x9FBE8F83
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0xC150042E
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x536024B9
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0xDDA12C7C
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0xA6F6C37D
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xEF0DEF4B
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0xAE519009
burning.
0xFBC6DE3D

0xB04A0E33
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0xF166BFB6
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x2F15107A
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x8515A73D
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0xB147C1F8
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x6AA2D3BE
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x24D13434

0xB04A0E33
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0xDAA47C77
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0xB3E0BAB4
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xA77139B6
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0xC4240E95
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x7AD61E93
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x9267564D
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x3B4EE2A7

0xB04A0E33
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x59290D6B
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0x9986ED2D
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0x72BAEF9F
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0xAF7891BA
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xC472B85B
water.
0x3DABB61F

0xB04A0E33
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0xC0733F15

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x44E3D5D2
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0xAF48DE62

0xB04A0E33
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0xB3164784
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0xDFD31BAE
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x27E07497

0xB04A0E33
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0xBA67A518
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0xF1537B02

0xB04A0E33
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0xCFE09D5F
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0xD2C52F80
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0xFFF99EED

0xB04A0E33
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x6E241E51
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x4DC907F1
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xB8C8000D

0xB04A0E33
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x588AFF94
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0xA8C389BD
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x718F67F5
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x48C44BFF
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xDC9FACE4

0xB04A0E33
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0x13EA2EC9

0xB04A0E33
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x690A354D
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0xF5A76BD7

0xB04A0E33
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x8AA9656D

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0x3C0D9D7A
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x4E239B5D

0xB04A0E33
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xB67FE464

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xCCA084C9
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x8858215C
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x6AB1D635
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0xE08EC79B
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0xE0382C3F
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x0F86AB5D
move, remember, or call any one."
0xC2182F9E

0xB04A0E33
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xDA2ACD10
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x116CA2BB
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xDF85B0DD
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0xFAB707AA
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x0B0D4B16
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0xC7CF7353
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xF7F20CC8
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x27AC25BB
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x5AC049DB
"and not something worse."
0x285A8126

0xB04A0E33
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x96390BFF
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x026C91FE

0xB04A0E33
"How, sir?"
0xF71B6A06

0xB04A0E33
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x97F3B12D
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0xFF68D691

0xB04A0E33
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xC37B6603
door."
0x39852C5C

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0x92695BC5

0xB04A0E33
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xAC5D8E34
think, or something like it?"
0x1BFC4D15

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x20C4DB31
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0xBA68FD20

0xB04A0E33
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0xB717FC81
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0xFE27A574
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x185CC82B
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x6FEBC8B9
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x9BDDF36E
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0xCD0B8356
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0xE9D22EA4
hours the servants will be up."
0x64A44816

0xB04A0E33
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x62BFAB14

0xB04A0E33
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xB3435F32
go.
0x450DAAA3

0xB04A0E33
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xA7298778

0xB04A0E33
"You said I might go, sir."
0xE1043927

0xB04A0E33
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x5869C25F
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x8616EC40
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xD25070F7
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xDC7ADB6A
At least shake hands."
0x8680DE23

0xB04A0E33
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xD247EDA6
both his own.
0x4B3E4950

0xB04A0E33
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x49396D70
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x964079DC
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0xB3A6907D
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x1B65197E

0xB04A0E33
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x4F57E9C5
his voice was checked.
0x3739BF5D

0xB04A0E33
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0xE8904AF8
in the case."
0x2A83FA81

0xB04A0E33
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xE3290A9F
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0x90104BA9
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0x1E2D3F36
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xE75192A2
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x3F59D186
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x74DC5566

0xB04A0E33
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x08B009DD

0xB04A0E33
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0xF4F057F5

0xB04A0E33
"What! you _will_ go?"
0xE9078C3C

0xB04A0E33
"I am cold, sir."
0x699B8937

0xB04A0E33
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x115FD5F2
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0xC3794B3E
expedient.
0x126AEC2F

0xB04A0E33
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0xDA9CA97F

0xB04A0E33
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0xECCFDE4C

0xB04A0E33
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x292BB60B
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0xDB712204
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0x3F555FF0
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0xEB0741D7
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0x92CA8FCF
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0xB6B06C1F
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x638E30D4
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x33334F77

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XVI
0x14A94043

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x28415B83
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xB70DC502
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x31CDA380
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x8DC95C02
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0x3222FE77
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x11B9CA7F

0xB04A0E33
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0xB2E2EA22
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xFFD425AB
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0xBD157C64
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x4B7CC51B
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xEDF06206
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x50CE72B5
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0x5E9DBBD2
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0x8E3B0870
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x2538B4EE

0xB04A0E33
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0x0B104AD6
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0x2E6E2DAE
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0x21CBFB02
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x0A2A5EDB
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x7B0D0D44
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0x5ADB524A
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0x237603EE
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x40CD6B9B
no other than Grace Poole.
0xA7B8D0F9

0xB04A0E33
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0xE35C299D
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x03DE28A6
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0xCD1E4FC0
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xBE088ABC
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0xD2FBB2E9
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0xD0C88F8E
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0x3341D077
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0xAEBBC897
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0xD0127678
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x824B1F8D
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x1544B8DB
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0xDCBD2E54
went on with her sewing.
0x15CD13E5

0xB04A0E33
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0xDF40D501
is past comprehension."
0x43DC0631

0xB04A0E33
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x45800287
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x6F4C23BA

0xB04A0E33
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x7345A302
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0x6319CC94
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xCB49ADAD
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0xAD8444C2

0xB04A0E33
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x1FD393BF
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x4A1F8CA2

0xB04A0E33
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x273164BE
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0xB96DA043
she answered--
0x833C32C5

0xB04A0E33
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0xA3857546
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0x13EA80D7
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0xD565205F
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0x1864B7A7
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x3A3B0DAB
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0xFC3861AD
a noise?"
0x0C813587

0xB04A0E33
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0xC611A9F8
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0xFFABE861
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0xDFC10E71

0xB04A0E33
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x6826439B
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x6F0496BC

0xB04A0E33
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x22DE531A
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x1CC7246E

0xB04A0E33
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x879EBFCB
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x61DDB906
conscious eye.
0xDB5E2256

0xB04A0E33
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xD7E0A872

0xB04A0E33
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0x3B121C7B

0xB04A0E33
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x0EF65BC8
gallery?" she further asked.
0xF4D5A16F

0xB04A0E33
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0xF1D489D2
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x96E1BC83
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x9DDFF0D9
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0x1D5E05EE

0xB04A0E33
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x4CA24050

0xB04A0E33
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x8427CB3B
you get into bed?"
0xC7761618

0xB04A0E33
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x4C035ED3
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0xBC0DE45B
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0xF174A2C7
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x3B93678A
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x1CC4226E
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x4D1C6B1B
lie down."
0x246DE89E

0xB04A0E33
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x05322360
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xE32D5C56
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0xAE9ECEFE
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0x3A53146D
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0xD8F94F48
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0xBC645D3E
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x85482FA6
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x6A43BFBC
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0xB1D82A08
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xE925648F
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x440DBBFC
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x69DC00CB
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x1B615F5C

0xB04A0E33
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x3B4F7223
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x14DE0673
entered.
0xD04CCB84

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x3C1D3F01
be ready: will you come down?"
0x0F1E85B8

0xB04A0E33
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x1648646F
carry it upstairs."
0x56BD9B95

0xB04A0E33
"You'll have some meat?"
0x272D5733

0xB04A0E33
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0xBF98A40F

0xB04A0E33
"And the sago?"
0x1657B5D5

0xB04A0E33
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0xC8652A3E
make it myself."
0xEFE205AA

0xB04A0E33
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0xC0638DF6
so I departed.
0x7D7CE292

0xB04A0E33
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x0C3812AB
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x9976C54C
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x0C2F0058
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x8D1F865B
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x6DDAB070
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xAF9909F7
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x2A1F9BCB
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0xDC954C33
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x9CE87626
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0x0DC45600
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x741D20DB
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x73DD284D

0xB04A0E33
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0xEB1C8085
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0xB91D9134
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xC18C219A
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x974B8F1D
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0xD4962E13
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x25E236DB
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x41659BC1
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xCE8C748F
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0xEEE8A5D1
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x862D0B10
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xA3D3D280
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0x7DF92594
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0xB1F7CFF1
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0xB5FD3639
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0xD6CF3F25
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x20FD38EC
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0xDC2F0A66
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x886AAEF9
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x64A02E08
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xB1C8B426

0xB04A0E33
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x5831B7D7
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x5DD9D04B
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x29535E53

0xB04A0E33
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x1182ACF1
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xF948FADF

0xB04A0E33
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xD8FF08B9
thinking.
0x96A48C19

0xB04A0E33
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0xCCAE55D4
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0x4742B2FF
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0xC3FA2B43
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xE8EA8465
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0xBA5DEE6F
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0xA7C48D3A

0xB04A0E33
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xB9086686
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0xBE598C88
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xAC38B4CF
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x127F8E39
impatient."
0x28E2ED96

0xB04A0E33
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0x802CBCCE
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x3C03F61F
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x89EF144C
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x2EFFC821
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0xD25103F5
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x15CE7ABE
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0xD3E85F54
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x03206AFE
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x20766C49
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0xFE41856D
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x028C441B
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x51639029
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x14174AE1
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0xE8766E17
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xA6976CA3
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0x52A805E8
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0xB83028A1
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x72054766
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x18BE5199

0xB04A0E33
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x37624BCF
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x035B2599
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0xEF724969
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x60F54C53

0xB04A0E33
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x8EA8ACC8
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xAD1DD203
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x5BCDEEBD

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x3704CE23

0xB04A0E33
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x7E119B13
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x8EE1AB49
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x656926AF
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0xD73473A9
deepening into total obscurity.
0xF01A2C67

0xB04A0E33
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0x8CC862FD
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x92E1B1B9
his journey."
0x6C487EB7

0xB04A0E33
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x54711378

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x77E918BA
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0xD5EC24EC
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x06832516
Colonel Dent, and others."
0xD67CC1DE

0xB04A0E33
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x34FD0AD0

0xB04A0E33
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0x04CA46F5
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0xE5A50888
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x947658A7
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x23A2F7CE
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0x8DA50531
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xD6375819
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0xE96FA38F
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x74F16F3D
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xB70ED6A8
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0xD592816D

0xB04A0E33
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0x295D5F89

0xB04A0E33
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0xE3D9290C
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0xA1559DFE
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x9ABAD0D8
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x38178739
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x4D41F338
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0x84AB69F4
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0xECD51F6C
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xD7BF440C
the evening."
0x27F83D5D

0xB04A0E33
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x5E275841

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x0539AA68
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xD643F763
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0x009944B9
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x9396E49F
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0xAD9087A2
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x66D86BAA
was certainly the queen."
0x6471E1EC

0xB04A0E33
"And what was she like?"
0xFF6B3636

0xB04A0E33
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xCD0A03AB
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x62AFAE46
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0x5AA5A6FA
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0xDEAE7344
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x66ED728F
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0x2F17EAF8
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x0A9A8C12
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0xBCABEC8B
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0xAAB3402E
jetty mass of her curls."
0xB979EF4D

0xB04A0E33
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x3A7C73DA

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x7B38CA17
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x31E525C2
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x3675029F

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0x6527039A

0xB04A0E33
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0x14463572

0xB04A0E33
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0x1A2E238E

0xB04A0E33
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0xDB9A34F4
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x782CC711
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x41FF9182

0xB04A0E33
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0x1E8167F6

0xB04A0E33
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0x4D998BDB
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0xB4D50245
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0xD607B838

0xB04A0E33
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x9F8AF5F7
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x98529FFA

0xB04A0E33
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x4C263AC7
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0x234B3233

0xB04A0E33
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0xDDF21929

0xB04A0E33
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0x499E7F47
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0xDEDABBF1
began tea."
0x5CD9836C

0xB04A0E33
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0xA684DF6E

0xB04A0E33
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x0CC3BE7B
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x72D1BBFC
conversation was turned into another channel.
0x66D03E70

0xB04A0E33
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0x6591DB17
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x5DB5EEC9
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0xC9FBDC94
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0x06F0B0C3

0xB04A0E33
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0xD74370D4
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x8CE455EA
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x7C491785
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x279285E8
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x9C10CEC6
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x3A7DC8BF

0xB04A0E33
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x6A70805C
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x02AE450A
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x82E8BAA7

0xB04A0E33
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0x7C415A09
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0x012959AB
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0xC2784FD5
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0xF4BFA3B8
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0xCBE6FF6E
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x379E5B79
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xECB66BF1
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0xD8B5B0DF
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0xAC8F6BB6
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0x20191408
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x9E8EFB77
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0xE2EC2CC7
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0xD4F758F0
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0xA5206F4C
is no extrication.
0xB48CAAD4

0xB04A0E33
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x44E9A553
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xE9923DE2
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0xE9A7011E
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x53141483
poor, and plain.'
0xC1C6026C

0xB04A0E33
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0xF83DCECB
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0x0F83F973
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x95B143EC
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0x681BCFBD
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x378D91C2
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0xAB4DF868
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0xC300E4D1
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x543739C6
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0xD417553A
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x3BDC92B7
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0xDB5B86C7
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0x79511D85
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xC26C737B

0xB04A0E33
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0xFD7A9C1C
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x3A9836A7
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0xEADE0932
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0xAAACBE7E
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0xAFE6EFC6

0xB04A0E33
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x771E79D3
calm, and fell asleep.
0x643A87A7

0xB04A0E33
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0xDAD3BF9F
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x5EDE8665
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x7895279A
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x78EFFB30
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x766FEFCB
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0xAC114296
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0xFC10F2CB

0xB04A0E33
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x4B95F527
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x87392DC8
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0xEDE9847B
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x51DEA6D7
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0x15AAF1B9

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0x27C6FB67
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0xEB18FDD3
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xE46CB287
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0x11CA181A
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xB3C66832
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x9BBAF8D2
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0x7D7F6257
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x46092F9D
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0x4AD6D3C4
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x91ACABEB
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0xA80CF6C1
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0x0BDBBD1B
on the contrary, I just said--
0x48849257

0xB04A0E33
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x1F1AEE23
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x71F1850D
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xF2173CCB
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0xDE2802DD
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0xB1C14A07
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0x578FD2B8
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0xDF01BBA0
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0x26AB5FBB
wanted and would be despised."
0xC917BEAC

0xB04A0E33
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0x1ACDA86A
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x58CE50A3
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x25545F47
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0xC9CA7B5D
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0x77C4DC26

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x85ABAC2A
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0xAA1433A6

0xB04A0E33
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x12089694
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x7834B5B2

0xB04A0E33
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x86C61F80
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0xBE5FC7A0
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x30D252F8
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0x66EA0B1E
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0xBB249688

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x3E4A85EB
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0xECBC4638
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x2DF5900B

0xB04A0E33
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x14FD103F
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0xE4E3E7C8
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0x07B3C7F2

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0xD597BC72

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0xDEE368E5
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x2B79F7A9
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0xE9C970FA
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x0956D34F
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x62DC32D7
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x5D348417
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x4E5B44FE
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0xDD25B3CB

0xB04A0E33
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0xC22A1F63
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x4164FA1C
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0xB825A0F8
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x59156913
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0xEFDF1E83
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xDB232FD9
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x3BCCB6BB
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0x7F157E23
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x89F927F1
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0xB6274A2C
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x829609CE
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x2AD0BB0D
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x9FC00A80
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x5D9A8032
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x68333C83
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0x5D68F328
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x88DF7EEE
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x1D294CBB

0xB04A0E33
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0xC5B9AF0E
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x9869BE97
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0xA8F51DB9
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0xDDA03D6F
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0xB32E4AFE
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0xE688D65B
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x92A799E7
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0xD15A2341
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0x41CB75C6
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0xD402CFD1
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x50D2DBD3
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0xBE2D3AB8
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0xEEA45481
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0xC4F5223C
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0x834A8D8D
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0x092F434E
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x198B70A7
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x29A53E8E
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x04747282
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0xEF3F82E0

0xB04A0E33
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x07471B39
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0x00A1A5D5
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x6B71EE8E
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0xFE827988
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x675FAF7E
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0xF6CD0AA6

0xB04A0E33
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x34FAA17F

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0xD74819A5
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x60E20759
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0xE2AA8169
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0xD6E807D7
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x025A8943
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0x159AB4E6
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0xA5DE3E40

0xB04A0E33
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x9CBA9A76

0xB04A0E33
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0xA51DFC5E
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0xF98FBFC2
the money she gets."
0x0A8AA15B

0xB04A0E33
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x80303213

0xB04A0E33
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0xF95A0B53
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0x8F2CC42E

0xB04A0E33
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x5BFB0135

0xB04A0E33
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x1EF4DEF4
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0x06123E27
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x1272C992
excluded.
0xE259B568

0xB04A0E33
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0x7DFDFC96
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x208FFEFF
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0x8D3A8FA3
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x7ABD057B
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x567121E8
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x57C731A7
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x4B95E71C
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0xF27FB8F8
sides.
0x9B6CCDB5

0xB04A0E33
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x9AF8C259
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xA6A958DE
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x5D2D4938
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0xEED21E8F
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0x27573D8E
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0xB0DA22B0
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0xF84A573C
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x8C73D68A
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0xAA9EE5B4

0xB04A0E33
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x67D0C2D7
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x47CDE12B
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0xD8E824E8
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0x17A3CFFB

0xB04A0E33
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0x16BDF726
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x0C87EA71
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0x300CE37D
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x6FE1603E
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0xE9054D59
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0xF017E041

0xB04A0E33
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0xC24ABD79
minutes."
0x7CD8FEAC

0xB04A0E33
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x020D900A
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0xFC555A0B

0xB04A0E33
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x1D11AD78
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x7B090538
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x64160CD7
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xFA6F4675
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0xC228A1C8
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0x823E8799
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x1C82A1C4
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x90CA4C14
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0xE1C34FD5

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xE47E82FC
below.
0x7DD9F1E4

0xB04A0E33
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0x15A1B861
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x33493C15
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0xDA083CA8
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0x0DD2A617
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x1C93B671
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0xE400813C
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x36EBD7DD

0xB04A0E33
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x89A95589
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x5E7B6639
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0xFFD31732
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0xAE3847CD
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x828458E0
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x6FDDAADB
and, for a time, a hush.
0x62FBE6B9

0xB04A0E33
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x7487EA8D
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x116802A3

0xB04A0E33
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xE5A565B2
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0xBECB9921
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0xEADCD7F9
on apprend."
0xA0A25CE4

0xB04A0E33
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0x26FE61A8

0xB04A0E33
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xF5626666
mange."
0xEAB526D6

0xB04A0E33
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xA3063702
get you something to eat."
0xF1BCB449

0xB04A0E33
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x114EA17E
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xB6FEF058
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x2D8176E5
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0x5265F3C2
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0xDC4C3AEB
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x455F2AC8
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x0D6E3BD5
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x39ED56D3
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x38DEC402
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0xAA93E461
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x683EE10B
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x4F4A5CC9
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0x089135F5
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0xA53B23F2
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x63915C96
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x56A47313
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0xF0C2EEE6

0xB04A0E33
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x9D2078EF
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0xFDFAA06B
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x46538C76
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x89A8E03D
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x233F8C79
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0xFC10DE01
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0xE52F247A

0xB04A0E33
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x8A0C4721
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0xA13242BC
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x1D841E19
dinner?"

0xB04A0E33
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0x8DDED1A6
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0xFA43AE7A
is your dinner."
0x2C9A0A93

0xB04A0E33
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x10AB3E8B
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0xCD037B76
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x43AB9E32
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x428D6D9F
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0xBE304666
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x76175242
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0xD167B0FC
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0xC6FC4ABA
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xDDE2628E
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0x5A088EF2
quel dommage!"
0x5DD13E02

0xB04A0E33
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x53E5286E
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x2A725107
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0xBD8F00E3
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xB0F32613
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x5EFF5652
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x3A467FEA
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x82C52D4E
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x59C5ABFA
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x159D460A
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x6A71CBB9
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x721B88C0
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x704C4D33
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x6A1ECCAE
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0x925F8A7C

0xB04A0E33
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x3F4F341D
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x8AC60DAB
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x8CBC538E
sought their chambers.
0x71F848A2

0xB04A0E33
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0x768248A6
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0xD2882F65
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x9FA98EC6
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0xF3F68D1A
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0xFCF2B7A9
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0xE31922C0
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x210BA4F2

0xB04A0E33
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0xFBED895A
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x037CC369
ladies."
0x607D313F

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x81A3F6CE

0xB04A0E33
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0xBDC175E9
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xC332876F
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x43A518CA

0xB04A0E33
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x21432D29
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0x175128AF
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x5A823291
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xE0B01E15

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0x536461F6
answered.
0xD7800E00

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x7DF1F66C
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x8F166F23
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x854B56CB
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xD6A7518F
case of contumacy.'"
0x10E40B5A

0xB04A0E33
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x4F928542
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x900E2600

0xB04A0E33
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x7D92617D
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xE91BD88B
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xFEDC9EAC
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0x52F08DF7
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xBF69341B
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0xE0BED0F4
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x8E43A950

0xB04A0E33
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x078F6131

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0xFBFF892F
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x025AAFD6
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x2029DA20
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x50A8D87E
stay at Thornfield."
0xE1FB909E

0xB04A0E33
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x12FE21A1
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x965479D8
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0x639B5834
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x6A175B66
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x0EFEF11E
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0xB16CE8AF
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xE25AD6B0
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x9C9ACF72
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0x67790C1F
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xF84C1FB5
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x2F31A2EA
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0x927889EC
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0xFE4E17ED
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xC23880B7
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x0B2403C1
descended.
0x7150B729

0xB04A0E33
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0xE6034508
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x4A187695
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0xF5B43577
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0xDC802BF5
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xA7E65384
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0xC786903C
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x73CA8313
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0xE87CF6E2

0xB04A0E33
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0xDD4B97FF
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0x82D61F35
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0xFF3C2930
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xCBD0A334
touched my knee.
0x03DD5916

0xB04A0E33
"What is it, Adele?"
0xF5818D54

0xB04A0E33
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x0E385C19
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0xC7965443

0xB04A0E33
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0xDE95BAFF
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0xDB3167B0
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0xE24CFAAC
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0xE75DC3DC
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0xFB4AE3F4
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0xB8DBB6FF

0xB04A0E33
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xBCAB2199
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x24FFA72D
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0xEDAC2D86
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0xB3794009
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x435CD047

0xB04A0E33
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0xBA3E2B2C
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xAEF41708
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x41BC8EFF
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0xF50DB303
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x5CCA7ABE
stared at me.
0x62C9B271

0xB04A0E33
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0xF9183102
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xC7200DD0
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x4326E2A4
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x058B6E72
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x8B6842B0
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x223854CD
and may as well mention them now.
0xB5E4D2FE

0xB04A0E33
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xFD045A9B
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x7C3AD392
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xC94AA609
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x4FB2C706
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x91BA346C
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x331BE0C4
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x2A50C93C

0xB04A0E33
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x8A17930D
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x5358D279
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x2368B5FD
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x2E8C0261

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0x90E5D8FC
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0x66906375
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x470CB9D8
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xC03C982E

0xB04A0E33
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0xF9542036
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x4631B103
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x73103458
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0xF804D91E
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x9A49F3D0
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x36259D0F
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0xBD2B85F5
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x0D4554B9
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x479D12FB
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x093D61CC
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0x19CD8ABB
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xB50DAA80
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x6BB5A0EA
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x379B5CCF
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xF313C8F0
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x9A1944ED
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xED562CC6
truly imperial dignity.
0xB9756A9E

0xB04A0E33
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0xF193C577
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0xD2AF69DB
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x8AD56DFA
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0xAF94E64D
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xDA3A2EEE
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0xAA0CF971
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x349A4064

0xB04A0E33
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0xE9267CB8
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x4B885602
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x8FCA9295
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xDF3F7153
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x932359CA
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x9E8F773A
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x54DD1387
haughty lip.
0x61978375

0xB04A0E33
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x8D14E8CA
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x521E727F
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x06A0EAF0
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x2A62790C
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0xB338BBC7
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0x253C50B9
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0xFFD16511
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x6FDB88E7
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x3F212CF1
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xF94687C5
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x8936D1FA

0xB04A0E33
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x8F9B5838
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x61293F52
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x2C2D6409
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0x48D39596
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x6690F8CB
in spotless white.
0x4A00C6CB

0xB04A0E33
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0x61E952F8
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0xE4A5797A
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0xBC601F7F
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0xF138ED3E
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x751B52DA
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x6D399C10
together.
0x8F4A5200

0xB04A0E33
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x01AC0C21
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x7DE20237
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0xA0F3C9AA
gravity--
0xF0FE69A8

0xB04A0E33
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xEF581FFB

0xB04A0E33
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x3CE5704C
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0xE0F37A11

0xB04A0E33
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x0C9FE646
little French girl he was speaking of."
0xB16B07F1

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x70EAAAAD

0xB04A0E33
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0xA7FD0215
child!"
0x9869C4D8

0xB04A0E33
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xEF238F6F
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0xE05324B2
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x5A70129A
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0xF499C555

0xB04A0E33
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0x5F127D29
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x84730B3D
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x4808BA2D
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0x228E5978
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0xBE0FB19B
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0xB2FB9081
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x196125E4
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x751EFF2E
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0xA707B6D9
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x9774B6D1
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x9A3465FA
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0x556D62D8
blood or vigour of brain.
0xCD27B38C

0xB04A0E33
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0xBC856B08

0xB04A0E33
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x5CABD850
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x0C9EFA98
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x263261A9
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x328C337A
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0xE5A2C492
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x19C359E4
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x4CAB948B
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0x98A7B294
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0x5239A99E
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xA69D67E8
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x4A0C8A10
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0x415652C6
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x87F77EBF
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x348F949D

0xB04A0E33
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0xA998390F
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x90A8D8DD
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0xFFDC5DBB
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0x46739072
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0xD928A577
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0xC12929A9
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xC380943F
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x8B0712A1

0xB04A0E33
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x474250A6
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0xCA3B2718
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x0BD7F10A
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0xA7C695A2
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0xF826ECCC
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x72356A5E
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0xBFEAA389
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x8965AEFB
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x09E6FF79
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x8B9BFADD

0xB04A0E33
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x21237A23
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0x157A569E
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x2619F8CC
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0xD79D9827
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0x6F8B3563
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0x829EB48A
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x5B671501
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0x845102D0
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x7F5B5964
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x5D0E3FB6
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x5D1EA2DE
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x70A262AE
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0xA4876F1B
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0xBC43D098
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x060AF397
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0x717FFF4A
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xB943B269
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xCEE5BD76
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0xF6EBC58D
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0xA477501E
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x133B06FD
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x49B8081D
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x52CC61EF
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xC359B874
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0x8EF80244
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0x58D41CAD
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x8A2DF53D
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0xD5EF8DC3
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xD19F59D8

0xB04A0E33
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0xC8228032
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x83A1F78B
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x3E471000
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x341C578B
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x337871A4
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x6859F756
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xAA869C2E
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0xD8A0E158
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0xDE5D57BC
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x811E95AB
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x4831D4BF
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0x457E07C9
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0x5EC04BB6
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x8B947B03
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x59CBCE7C
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xB971DD76
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0xA1B2EBBE
selects a mate.
0xC2A402B1

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x436E8E98
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x2C30274F
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0xB38DA1F4

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0xFFB151EA

0xB04A0E33
"Nor am I."
0x48B6FF04

0xB04A0E33
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x689C5CBB
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x97607493

0xB04A0E33
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0xD931984E

0xB04A0E33
"You should have sent her to school."
0x3ABA1D98

0xB04A0E33
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0xDE7353FC

0xB04A0E33
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0x962B5207
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x356C9051
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0xEA281221
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0x00FAAA5E

0xB04A0E33
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0x8AA792CC
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x6F3866BC
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0xC234CAA3

0xB04A0E33
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0x8B8CB55A
straight before him.
0x692B68FC

0xB04A0E33
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0x0647AB0F
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0xBD0799B1
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x034AD8A1
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x88E8BE7D

0xB04A0E33
"Did you speak, my own?"
0xA51D6981

0xB04A0E33
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x46A10C54
her question with an explanation.
0x3CB7928E

0xB04A0E33
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0x2FC5F868
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x985635A4
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0x019BF917

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0xDC80CC67
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0x966B095D
the anathematised race was present.
0xBEC02654

0xB04A0E33
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0xCFF76F05
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0x1920B33A
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x33171BFB

0xB04A0E33
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0xFB56963C

0xB04A0E33
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x6AE634A7
three times with portentous significancy.
0xF70C1FBA

0xB04A0E33
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0x142345B4

0xB04A0E33
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0x84D26CB1

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x9692FA37
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x77A42831
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x34CB7773
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0xD9A0CF57
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0xF001FAE1
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x21B0C118
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0xC4A613C6
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x27D3A638
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x57524E8E
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x438FF9E1
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0xB07B6184
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0xED5D9658

0xB04A0E33
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0xC7872082
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0xC5FF2483
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0xD63ABFB4
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x514267AE

0xB04A0E33
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x4E5620AC
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0xD83D51C5
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0x84581C83
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0xE319BB8C
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0xB18FE59E
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0x4CFFC19F
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xBA60D8C2
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0xCC3311C6
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0x004A28D9
lady-mother?"
0xD34E8C26

0xB04A0E33
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0x9115D72A
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x74553813
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0x3FA69E16

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0x1D04850C
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0xB13AF4A4
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0x1DA4B313
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0x93933C60
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0x3C88324E

0xB04A0E33
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0x482A99C2

0xB04A0E33
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0x968AA03F

0xB04A0E33
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x5EF8CA84
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0x86D250C3
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x9917A197
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0x58FBD7F5

0xB04A0E33
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0x37F179FE
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0xDFCEFD5C
she would give us anything we asked for."
0xEBAE8D34

0xB04A0E33
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0x1A0690A3
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0x38E114AF
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0x0B64407C
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0x18C4F566

0xB04A0E33
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x984A093F

0xB04A0E33
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0xD3EC07FA
in voice to-night?"
0x55A8F959

0xB04A0E33
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0x9B4D6817

0xB04A0E33
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0xA84E3788
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0xD81DD4FF

0xB04A0E33
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0xD9F742CC

0xB04A0E33
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0xB25B694B
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xFAD429AD
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0xEAB9253B
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0x1803913F
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x0107A016
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xDC0A758A
hand."
0x9D7EE3A8

0xB04A0E33
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0xAC51603F
Mr. Rochester.
0xCD16BA00

0xB04A0E33
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0x252C6762

0xB04A0E33
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0xD0487DB5

0xB04A0E33
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x862F79B9
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x3AEFAB86
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x9A374D07
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x9DCD0183
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x8A6A12DE
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x1BCA2DC4

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x22D7377D
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0x2502BCED
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0xA8E28A6F
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0xC1B4BCED
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x153E33A5
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0xD29F084B
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x743CFC63
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x54D9420D
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x481A1147
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x9B8C0958
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0x2CC5C8E7

0xB04A0E33
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0xE3CE5A79
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x7F460105
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0x2122D46E
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0xF6E91C66
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0x395F6A83

0xB04A0E33
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x4968FA22

0xB04A0E33
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0x1B522C14
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0xC93FBA91

0xB04A0E33
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0xFEC5ABD2
water."
0xEEC6E620

0xB04A0E33
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0xC9F2D302
such things _should_ be done."
0xE806FCD1

0xB04A0E33
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0x20959A68
fail."
0x43C4F008

0xB04A0E33
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0x01A63E49
proportionate punishment."
0xA529A976

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x0B451EB3
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0xB77CB715

0xB04A0E33
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xCFB77360

0xB04A0E33
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0xC576A0D6
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0x74BF075A
capital punishment."
0xB9F15B2C

0xB04A0E33
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x3981E6B3
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x3B645F55

0xB04A0E33
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0xE13EC93A
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0x7C0B0E11
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0xFB4D9BC4
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xCD261B03
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x4F5A13A2
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x2195D2A3
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x3EB36B04
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0xC59CCE81
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0xE7177F8C
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x7FB0D16E
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0x62BA1164
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x66DDA130

0xB04A0E33
"How do you do?" he asked.
0xDE193B42

0xB04A0E33
"I am very well, sir."
0x06B0CE7F

0xB04A0E33
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x6B8D3565

0xB04A0E33
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x4094B71C
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x7B87F1CF

0xB04A0E33
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x0872C3DB

0xB04A0E33
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0xE263001B

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x6B6E7663

0xB04A0E33
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x70BF5CEE
What is the matter?"
0x2666A7E5

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x4FD9921E

0xB04A0E33
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x7973449B

0xB04A0E33
"Not the least."
0xF680571C

0xB04A0E33
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x8545AC0F

0xB04A0E33
"I am tired, sir."
0x667B2A6B

0xB04A0E33
He looked at me for a minute.
0x30EBA4FC

0xB04A0E33
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x37F15F04

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0xD88CE190

0xB04A0E33
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x7BDF57F7
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x19CF235D
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x1F2555BF
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x1585F442
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0xEF813A06
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0xF32FBF37
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0xCF137DF4
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x7BF97901
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

CHAPTER XVIII
0x676F22F4

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0xE4F115A3
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x3F743D44
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0xB08EF942
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0xDC129FA6
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x21C53DFE
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x60CA1D8A
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x79C829A1

0xB04A0E33
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xD1348644
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0x81D05318
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x54CAB7DE
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0xED12E35F
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0x95BA1B3D
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x45227A79
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x6228B42D

0xB04A0E33
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x5C3EC083
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x899DE749
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x57923C23
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x7248B12F
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xA5613503
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x26F33370
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x5EF68A7B
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0xC2A82677
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x327C9A90
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0xC79A16B0
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0xDE55460C
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0x964924E8
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x219CCBF1
drawing-room.
0xAAA94C9B

0xB04A0E33
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x3344BA75
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0x95AC9597
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x770C63C5
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0x71E6BB98
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x5622180D

0xB04A0E33
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0x7007E7FA
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0xE96A899F
usual seat.
0xA2385FD6

0xB04A0E33
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x919B2916
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0x15DDC42E
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0x9D330912
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x5ACC6F3A

0xB04A0E33
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x094CB888

0xB04A0E33
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0x7A14F4DB
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x99018A47
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xE54322C5
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0xE207537A
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0x14527319
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x98C0D5E4
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x2CB6ECCB
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xCB4B8CA5
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x6FB22A93
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x7061BCB1
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x9A57F954
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0xE6AA3BE8
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0xF9D126C1
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x7566DFE2
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x51468C77

0xB04A0E33
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xC7DF9A18

0xB04A0E33
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0xAAAAF247
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x6849141E
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0xDD118A27
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0xCE8047E9
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x0858C8F6
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x59EF01D4
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x101A83D7
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x3CC0EE0D

0xB04A0E33
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x8E29244D
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x98D60E9B
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0xDADCD7F9
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x2D8F7897
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0x647BEDF3
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x65983087
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x240888F1
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x94CDF5C9
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0xC0C92D56
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x5219E861
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0xB7218A1A
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x632DBDD4

0xB04A0E33
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0xCEF481C2
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x19354FED
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x84445B06
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xB8D6E5BB
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x9E8BA6BE
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xE81D2309
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0xC015BC02
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x3BA3AF50
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0xCA4EF7E0
wanting.
0x110B2355

0xB04A0E33
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x539A6B3E
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0xAB08E5AB
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0xCBAF48EF
curtain again descended.
0xE36C32F9

0xB04A0E33
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x4CE7559D
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x54EC44B8
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0x8938C05F
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0xDAAB9C80
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0xBF11BFD5

0xB04A0E33
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x87AE1C2F
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x4D5BC9FC
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0x568CB409
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0x695B3AD2
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0x66756011
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x29E4DAFB
attached fetters.
0x694CB1C4

0xB04A0E33
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0xEFE8E9ED

0xB04A0E33
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x4F516D07
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0xE690476F
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0xA1869C1F

0xB04A0E33
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0xAB41B4D3
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x01B97445
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x46D288EE

0xB04A0E33
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x30C1C678

0xB04A0E33
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0xDF158B00
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0xEBEC8AB2

0xB04A0E33
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0x20208FE4

0xB04A0E33
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x620B2FCC
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x00B34A19

0xB04A0E33
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0x2FE99016
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xD29745B2
colour rose.
0x133E7353

0xB04A0E33
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0x0B2C59D6
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x162C4F71
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0x6F1BC25A
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x8EF4F1AA
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0xD2167D0E
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0x226049A4
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x2BE03E57
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0x6A00FA3C
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0x8ABFA39B
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0x5E7E8B1F
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0x9A945291
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x613C1D7F
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0x5E045963
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x9F081E34
returns in memory at this moment.
0x4E81FA5F

0xB04A0E33
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0x2E3B6127
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x0270AA7A
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0xEB839B57
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x7BE5B313
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0x9E99A06A
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x21F69EAC
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x0A0D1B11
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0xE405673C
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0x358AFBFF
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x1B7DCC8C
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x7F9C3601
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0x37BE6E30
very pride, irresistible.
0xDF7EB7B9

0xB04A0E33
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0x39DED767
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0xD6B337C2
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x38EB20A9
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0xE9DF55CB
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x2816C3C0
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0x457085C0
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xEB423B3C
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0xA7BF89AA
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x7EBDCCBE
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x61C285B1
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x79A00CDB
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0x3AEB94A1
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x3F564412
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x93DD5B32
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x7E705B29
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xAEE7F440
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0xCC8818AE
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x30F687D3
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0x083A21DD
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x598B4ED8
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0xC91FEE9A
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x80A7CB97
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0xA47009F0
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x8DC7FAE2
torturing pain arose.
0x9B9233AA

0xB04A0E33
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x96135D08
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0xB96699F5
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0x4B3508E1
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0xE97B0976
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0xA36B919D
not charm him_.
0xA079EF6A

0xB04A0E33
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x1169302B
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x6D23860D
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x2E889053
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x09CDF5D0
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x99D68E44
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0xDBBC7C77
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x6B3F16DF
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x7D12AFF6
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x5A2253E3
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x813B10C9
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0xB74587E0
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0x99AD87E3
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x8ACE2A24
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x480F8FFA
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x7BC965BE

0xB04A0E33
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xE89807D9
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xB56675DF
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0x71001EA1
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0xFD1E80AB
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x63055C5F
silent conquest might have been won.
0x4321096C

0xB04A0E33
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0x556B43FF
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0xB417A3FD
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x71C1BA2C
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x28A0F3C7
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xB546DEFF
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xF1E4F326
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0x7887BB18
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x64413C49
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0xEC5765B2
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xE0390065
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x875196EF
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x87856937
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xB89AF979
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x7F531C5A
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x26AC291D
shines on."
0xFEE00C21

0xB04A0E33
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x86F4B340
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x9105B0FB
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0x27775546
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0x60795565
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x2404CB41
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x6E8FE175
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x962CA99E
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0xCC640D60
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x6AED575E
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x117888A2
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0x93D411EC
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x4A43741F
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x943E015D
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0xEF64750C
as I wished to act.
0x510EE217

0xB04A0E33
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x9DEE8388
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x518A6EDE
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x63F4A625
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x3FBA6C51
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x62893626
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0xF2890D56
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x97C213EB
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x8160CF63
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0xE944D6EA
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0xBE8DD8EE
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0xDD11025A
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x7008CE04
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0xBA00625F
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x550532D1
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x46E8113E
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x3F6904E3
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0xB9EAB152
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x4B306902
nature.
0xCDF70770

0xB04A0E33
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x34F24D64
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xF494D1F0
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0xBE3BC83A
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x4B2C83A4
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x0FDB61AB
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x8D70BBA9
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0x84E99B2E
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0xDE40B1A2
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0xB1D81AA5
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xF52090CA
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x1F7BDFD7
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0xF369517C
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x35B82178
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0x15E2B9E8
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x501C9039
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x6B3C9B3E
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x16FA97EC
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x2F747277
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x90C0EE82
vivacity of conversation.
0x8FB7592E

0xB04A0E33
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x0D235D03
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0xDC2A2FB4
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x80D7F06E
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x1DF1EE7A
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x8577ABD4
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0x7769C689
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x99CECE0F
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0x422EEAFA
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0xA04E5C89
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xF970D12E
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0xB186273F
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0xB9C2EB88
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xF55FDEAE
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x9C58F0AA
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x80F41EE5

0xB04A0E33
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x293E15FF
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0x4910E740
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x4211CA74

0xB04A0E33
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x050D198C

0xB04A0E33
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0x6697EA99
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x3E143550
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0x82FB1DB8
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x27938588

0xB04A0E33
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0xD575D850
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x73BC4A06
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x5F0568F9

0xB04A0E33
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x3D44745A
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0xB2DA6CD3
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0xCF1C755A
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x4D329888
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0xC7D788B7
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0x5CA6138E
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0xD3A16EEF

0xB04A0E33
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x21A739D8
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x209281CD
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xC89BDE43

0xB04A0E33
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0xE25DE491
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xD164D9E3

0xB04A0E33
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0xC852FAD1
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x8799B624
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x2DA67A1D
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x8A3E790A

0xB04A0E33
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0xB43C3896
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x3C4EBCFC
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x0C538F69
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x758BC5A5
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x6383098B
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x703B5007
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0xF2138E2B
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x5C827879
least so I thought.
0xF3D9771A

0xB04A0E33
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x689ADF90
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xE3725A41
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x256FD73A
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xA7979DC8
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0xF9D8F0D4
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0xB40C86DB
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0xF41FAD51
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0xE76DCBEF
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xADE612B2
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0x95331DE4

0xB04A0E33
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x2B421953
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x6FF2F265
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x1B68D2B0
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0xE7C1D543
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x65637CF1
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x97634F82
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0xE2187177

0xB04A0E33
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xBF27CCF3
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x55191BDC
that "extremes meet."
0xF9F95F7C

0xB04A0E33
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0xB38A0005
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x813EDEA5
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x2AD7173E
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x8D783061
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x9E51B055
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0xA57F881B
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x89894BA4
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x31F2A704

0xB04A0E33
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x3A23DDE3
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x5BD4D668
a placid eye and smile!"
0x7E69BD52

0xB04A0E33
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x5D00D036
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x9956EC53
Hay Common.
0xF55FD3F1

0xB04A0E33
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x7950ABC6
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0xCEAD2AA0
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0x361AC72F
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x42B190FC
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0xDA00D52E
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0x756871DC
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x744093A9
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xB57FD171
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x8E861AFD
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0xCD404AB8
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0xF86D6C4C
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xF0CC8B84
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0xF36DBE01

0xB04A0E33
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0xB4C821FD
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x32AD0269
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x962491D9
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xE23458A2
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x53299FDE
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0xBB4C4741
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0xA47E29CD

0xB04A0E33
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0x1E908B27
off," replied the magistrate.
0x0E4744B9

0xB04A0E33
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0xCCE2B431
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x74189A1A
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x61881F0B
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0xD3210F4F
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0x9262FAA2
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0x534D9CE4
see her?"
0xCAF5C931

0xB04A0E33
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x37403AF6
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x63E01B5A

0xB04A0E33
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x2EF7238F
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0xF19E8726
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0xCD55CE31
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0xFB72EB16

0xB04A0E33
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x7DC849CA

0xB04A0E33
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x62346358
must and will do it."
0x01C4A7B2

0xB04A0E33
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0xBE8437E3

0xB04A0E33
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0x5F70C39D

0xB04A0E33
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xF9A70C5D
in, of course."
0x35383C86

0xB04A0E33
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0xE8204022
throw away such a chance of fun."
0x7287DCAD

0xB04A0E33
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x42635BF7

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x86DC9F3D
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xB8F7F3A0

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0xFB31E7D7
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x3728F328
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x6BDFCD7F
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x74A18DDB
forward."
0xA59A0D58

0xB04A0E33
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x21610A87

0xB04A0E33
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x005DB04F
Sam!"
0x16A6877B

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x25A0CD8A
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x0932FEDB

0xB04A0E33
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x3978F8B7

0xB04A0E33
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0xB1F62598

0xB04A0E33
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x838571E4
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xF4E6B96F

0xB04A0E33
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x66DA5B26
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x0E599EDE
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x4EA90282
one."
0xCDFDB290

0xB04A0E33
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0xF75EC1BD
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x4EB34312

0xB04A0E33
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x6EB53D39
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0xDA91C4A1
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0xC7DF4AF3

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0xBE3CD1B1

0xB04A0E33
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x41240E7F

0xB04A0E33
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0xAB312919
once more.
0x2A17E198

0xB04A0E33
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x5BB21DC2
know who will be her first visitor."
0x9F214C85

0xB04A0E33
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x971EAD26
said Colonel Dent.
0xC9BE3B20

0xB04A0E33
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x5FFE5701

0xB04A0E33
Sam went and returned.
0xEBE1F90D

0xB04A0E33
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x3B7800A2
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0xE471528C
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x2765C4BD

0xB04A0E33
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0xA85BD45D

0xB04A0E33
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0x5AA3A275
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0xAD51BDA7
of his men.
0xDEDB123B

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xD733060E
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x03CEAE3C
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x9A9305FD

0xB04A0E33
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0x7D1FAFDD
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x90688A6C
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x8B27A596
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x4BC2FD22

0xB04A0E33
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x7E68A798
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0xB9722441

0xB04A0E33
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x9FA23D1C
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0x2A5A63A3
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0xDF3DC89A
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x3FB34A8C

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0xB5D39AAB

0xB04A0E33
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x34190C82

0xB04A0E33
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0x064387DF
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xB37C6B8A

0xB04A0E33
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0x43382038
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x1E046AE2
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xF4E2B614
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0xE2B0FDD5
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x4191FB7F
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x50ACD378
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x1CE9A122
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xDDD01161
morning, as he threatened."
0x36A0CC69

0xB04A0E33
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x8D6C1E85
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0xD7E0C350
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x1422694E
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x0D390451
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x79291CC5
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x2DB2AB23
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x285C0420
whatever revelations had been made her.
0x774AA9D7

0xB04A0E33
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x278AA296

0xB04A0E33
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0xB2137879
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0x8580723E
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x7E729CD5
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0xD61AA537
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0xE34C7AB7
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0xFD65D602

0xB04A0E33
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0x5651CD6D
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xE9E914C3
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0x4D47ECDD
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x312F33AD

0xB04A0E33
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xBBE2E2C0
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x94744C4D
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x4A5EAB29

0xB04A0E33
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xFD598087
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0xF3C86597
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x0EE9908F
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x2C245356
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x3D0D1AF9
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x65EC5847
they most wished for.
0x83FE88E6

0xB04A0E33
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x4EA556F2
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x50B00F07
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x56DA74EA
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0x18E745A5
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x12FE5FBD
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xD28A5FF2
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x0C2B60C9

0xB04A0E33
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x00D83AC4
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x52257F41
saw Sam.
0xF6CFE9AC

0xB04A0E33
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x3EA4DD9A
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0x2DD10B2F
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x5DA5305F
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0x48F7F1E2

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0x240EE9BD
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x2CE644D6
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x96430C64
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xFFBFF476
quietly behind me.
0x1A66769C

0xB04A0E33
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0x6DFCE055
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0xEFACC9D0

0xB04A0E33
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0xE69A9178
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0xFEA046F9

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XIX
0x58C1321D

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x0412E015
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0xE376B435
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0xCD86F2DD
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0xA805F65F
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0xDF25E8CF
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0xB71F1AB0
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0xA7D0DD18
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0xFA106BC1
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x7BB15593

0xB04A0E33
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x1AA07C71
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x02C78C91
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0xFEF32507
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0xE37F0BE3
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x3E84E6ED
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x2E2F35A0
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0xB958C7A1
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0xDCC6A8BF
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xF00800AD

0xB04A0E33
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x768A751A
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0xA493B15D

0xB04A0E33
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0xA70189E7
warn you, I have no faith."
0xF28150B4

0xB04A0E33
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0x74DF091E
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0xCC4430E9

0xB04A0E33
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0xFD704418

0xB04A0E33
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0xE89FC7D1

0xB04A0E33
"You need them all in your trade."
0x3DB0AC68

0xB04A0E33
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0xEB01EAE7
you tremble?"
0xCA45F1F2

0xB04A0E33
"I'm not cold."
0xDAAE90AB

0xB04A0E33
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0xDB8E8462

0xB04A0E33
"I am not sick."
0xC619E601

0xB04A0E33
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0xDA76A9B6

0xB04A0E33
"I'm not silly."
0x6B2E8F8C

0xB04A0E33
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x46EEEB96
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x32205FCC
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x6B898E96
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x9E302ED9
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x2A9B2179

0xB04A0E33
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0x5CC3BF71

0xB04A0E33
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x188E4C73
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x7D429789
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x1645FB0C
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x0893F112
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0xB6433898
you."
0x2632D859

0xB04A0E33
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x92A8DA02
with vigour.
0x10271422

0xB04A0E33
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0x4DAB0060
solitary dependent in a great house."
0xDC6D251A

0xB04A0E33
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0xFEB3BF6C
one?"
0x0D151E8E

0xB04A0E33
"In my circumstances."
0x8BE964A5

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0xE605E03D
placed as you are."
0xF85397AD

0xB04A0E33
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x4FD9998C

0xB04A0E33
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0xADB8265D
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x3C577CA5
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0xB26FA3E7
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0xD22E17F1

0xB04A0E33
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0x4DD8FEA3

0xB04A0E33
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0xEEC8632F

0xB04A0E33
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x9101DAF5

0xB04A0E33
"To be sure."
0x5171E98A

0xB04A0E33
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x62A405B8
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xD7D20B43
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0x82C69E41
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0x1C27C30F

0xB04A0E33
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0x6DF936D2
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x4B05E8EF
there."
0x66FB0B90

0xB04A0E33
"I believe you," said I.
0x112BDC4E

0xB04A0E33
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x53B8B3FF
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0x917DC6C1

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0xB049019E
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xDCEFAD4A

0xB04A0E33
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x09DA13FE
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0xFECED1A5
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x4EF8BDA9

0xB04A0E33
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0xAEA79A0E
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x6BBF8275
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0x4A92E65B
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0xB0E5736B
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0xBDDF25D4
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0xFE73A82D

0xB04A0E33
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0x1E1A5394

0xB04A0E33
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xEDCB5C19
whispers of the future?"
0xFAD16AA6

0xB04A0E33
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0xED3F64B2
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0x74B75E52

0xB04A0E33
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0x35157E53
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x7A4CB5C7

0xB04A0E33
"You have learned them from the servants."
0x5BF96ED0

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0x5CA9BD55
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x8FFA6AE8

0xB04A0E33
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0xC9852287

0xB04A0E33
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0x713A45B7
after all, then!"
0x1AD1C257

0xB04A0E33
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0x4684279D
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0x10B2321F
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x8C1D78F1
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0xB9064614
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0xC14DBD7B
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0xFEBEA490

0xB04A0E33
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x1A556746

0xB04A0E33
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0x17785276

0xB04A0E33
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0xCC855DDE
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0xFC342D41

0xB04A0E33
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0xB0DA5144

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0x47D4787F
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0x1794B9D3

0xB04A0E33
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0x1406691E

0xB04A0E33
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0x6FC7406A

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x544AF46F
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x5B75DD3B
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0x6D6CC48E

0xB04A0E33
"I what?"
0xDFD80733

0xB04A0E33
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0x2A59FD5E

0xB04A0E33
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x247F0CAE
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x1C198E5C
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0xBC46F25C
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x50C812F6
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0x641C41E2
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0xC1F70648

0xB04A0E33
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0x278DF8BC
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x4D03C055

0xB04A0E33
"He is not at home."
0x6366D72E

0xB04A0E33
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0xB6088E47
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x5E0C21DA
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x29777818
it were, out of existence?"
0x0E869D64

0xB04A0E33
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0xD325838C
you had introduced."
0x23EE549A

0xB04A0E33
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0x89CC4E75
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0x1E47545B
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0x9B44E95D

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0x530C89E1

0xB04A0E33
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0x193132B6
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0x1F5B5F47
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0xE8728E18

0xB04A0E33
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0x83ED2F65
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0x3183ED49
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0x270F5BA7
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x765D58E9
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0xFCACF456
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0xB02DE0B9

0xB04A0E33
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0x982FC19B
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0x735168F9
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0xFF08DD97
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0x395520B9
noticed this?"
0x1C539C1D

0xB04A0E33
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x4BC90E32

0xB04A0E33
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0xC78D2F01
gratitude?"
0x5413F5E8

0xB04A0E33
I said nothing.
0x03B1570B

0xB04A0E33
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x9613E6D2
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0x50D2E3BB

0xB04A0E33
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0xAD793190

0xB04A0E33
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0xFCF9271D

0xB04A0E33
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0x22703710
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0xFBE14129

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x52A7D0FB

0xB04A0E33
"Shortly?"
0xA92EFB1F

0xB04A0E33
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0xDB117CEA
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0xA4CD448F
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0xFDDC4C20
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x06811525
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0xB3046B0A
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0xAF32891E
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0xC19E0039
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0x67BA5DE5
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0x6B4966B2
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0xECA7A09D

0xB04A0E33
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0x469A008A
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0x0308F6B3

0xB04A0E33
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0xD9E4BBC7
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0xDB365126
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0x4BC500EC
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x80792111
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0x9291E305
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0xACDB6C00

0xB04A0E33
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0xD6E969C1

0xB04A0E33
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0x64C089EE
p190.jpg}
0xA57F8D6E

0xB04A0E33
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x82F6DC0D
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0x2459BB39

0xB04A0E33
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0x5B37AEAC
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0xD39C07A0
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0xB30CF350
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0xFE00B22C
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x46F1BDFD
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0xB96E3378
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0xA51AC118
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0x377D1D4B
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xADD85E92

0xB04A0E33
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0x7F74E065
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0x31EA2B4D
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0x44DFE4FB
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0x19DEBB19
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0xE8BA950D
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0x8CA8591A

0xB04A0E33
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0x637F965F
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0x61D4AE66
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0x40B5FBD9
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0x6F9AFC6D
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0x22985F3E
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0x9F5BE5DB
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0x23E75010
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0x21F1CB8D
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x6EE2FEEE
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0x835DF128
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0xDCF3DD18
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x9AE1A7FD
dictates of conscience.'
0x31AF537C

0xB04A0E33
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x3E69D04E
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0xE9C2C9E0
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0xA143AC0E
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0xAF9605AE
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0xFF20E0C9
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0x0BDAC54C
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0xA25A5C6A
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x7D512D35
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0x03AF3629
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0xA5600F89
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0xE57EB43B
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0x71437F8A
me; the play is played out'."
0x544F6D6C

0xB04A0E33
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0xDBEF888C
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0x101B8691
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0xF4E55DBE
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0xBF1ADD4D
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0x8D493F98
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0x0F8DE7B2
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x36C664D7
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x71BB4EFC
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0x5D04B943
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0x3E854A93
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0xE037E130
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0xE2208171
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0x6067AF31

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x2EAD53F3

0xB04A0E33
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0xA93DC70C

0xB04A0E33
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0xFA31AA40

0xB04A0E33
"Break it, sir."
0x054BEF53

0xB04A0E33
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x0F52D830
disguise.
0x929A4482

0xB04A0E33
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0xBA7E4E3E

0xB04A0E33
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0x08E71A24

0xB04A0E33
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x9A4743FF

0xB04A0E33
"But not with you?"
0x33768BFF

0xB04A0E33
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0xE2E30BAA

0xB04A0E33
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0x6B0121F6

0xB04A0E33
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x0CEC91B5
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0x7B2D3238
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x64D4E99D

0xB04A0E33
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0x9EADE640

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x9486044C
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0xE3705B86
but it was not right."
0x488175F9

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0xD5999535

0xB04A0E33
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0x24A7A751
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x5ABE0A37
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0xF5ADB585
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0x3A62CBA1
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x7E3A9E29
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xA592D548
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xD171E88F
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x914B93BE

0xB04A0E33
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0xA76AF876
signify?"
0xC4ED603B

0xB04A0E33
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0xA483DDB1
now, I suppose?"
0xF14B1265

0xB04A0E33
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0x37D743FC
yonder are doing."
0x4BBF77A1

0xB04A0E33
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0x1F07F70B

0xB04A0E33
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0x1EA8E320

0xB04A0E33
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x1D17D357
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0xF0F6559F
left this morning?"
0x90E8606A

0xB04A0E33
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0x0C310630

0xB04A0E33
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0xC636F35F
installing himself here till you returned."
0x5FEB1CB1

0xB04A0E33
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x9B8D6DC3

0xB04A0E33
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x07D3AA01
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x8807AAA4

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x665B14FE
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x25096F29
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0xFD35D304

0xB04A0E33
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x03008891
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x38ED4BA3
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x62086BBD
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0xD33952ED
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x2FD80E2F

0xB04A0E33
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xEB7AB57D

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x95A72AB1

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0xC996726F

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x58FC1A08

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0xDA9CED68

0xB04A0E33
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0xF7FB2144
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0xF2EC02FC
and dreary look.
0xB28796AA

0xB04A0E33
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0xE64428C9
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x40BB8B82

0xB04A0E33
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x189D0DB8

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0xCE83067C

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0xE4D880AF

0xB04A0E33
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x9933D9C5
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x16BE63B5
doing."
0x23AA3077

0xB04A0E33
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0xCF61A35B
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x2FA631D3
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x0D593F10
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x053B6010
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0x35CF9E27
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0xE933676E
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xC6F71D12
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xC571D036
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x7F29CF3C

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0xA29F56F5
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0xA98148DF

0xB04A0E33
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x067EF567
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0xE972F218

0xB04A0E33
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0xBD1DACC6

0xB04A0E33
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x8C1462EC
strange?"
0x045A9C5B

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x68A9F815

0xB04A0E33
"And Mason?"
0x032BCF7B

0xB04A0E33
"He was laughing too."
0xD51AEABF

0xB04A0E33
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xFA3595E6
Jane?"
0x2C36C3D6

0xB04A0E33
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x4153D815

0xB04A0E33
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0xDAB01872
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x8076DE9A
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0xCD3754EA

0xB04A0E33
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x0DF30D4A
you."
0x2632D859

0xB04A0E33
"To comfort me?"
0x1FB33168

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0xEAF23FC6

0xB04A0E33
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0xA68CE090

0xB04A0E33
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x9E943ABE
care nothing about it."
0x65EABB20

0xB04A0E33
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x15F489DC

0xB04A0E33
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x553BF443
you, I am sure, do."
0xFB20D684

0xB04A0E33
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0xCDA78DBD
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x219ED33A
and then leave me."
0xA30C7658

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xB624EBEB
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x160DDAAA
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0xBEA87989

0xB04A0E33
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x8FF64B0A
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0xF6D2A178
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x75ABD887

0xB04A0E33
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0x3B1D979A
asleep.
0xEC24CA10

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XX
0x38272707

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0x0D7AF265
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x23BA0384
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0x656059C8
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x026D166D
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x3186AC92
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x688CA729
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0x677D6C79
the curtain.
0xD120C50C

0xB04A0E33
Good God!  What a cry!
0xB04A2A77

0xB04A0E33
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x1CAF882C
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x7325D273

0xB04A0E33
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0x8466345D
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x5189284D
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x0856E599
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0x2B47E52B
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0xB5E60AA2
it could repeat the effort.
0x03849339

0xB04A0E33
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0x10A0D30E
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x3F6B20DF
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x690AFFFD
voice shouted--
0xC9D8F5EE

0xB04A0E33
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x93C5AB9A

0xB04A0E33
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0xCF298BC6
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0xD6645F96

0xB04A0E33
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0x80BEA437

0xB04A0E33
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xF07EE99E
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0x181580DA
was silence.
0xA949EA3F

0xB04A0E33
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0x24FE13E1
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x828084BD
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0xC3CCE815
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0xC460498C
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x6AD5D8CE
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0xEA713F03
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x777BEC36
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x9ED0D9F3
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x7466D42C
confusion was inextricable.
0x1599894D

0xB04A0E33
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x946EF2D3
in his bed."
0x92252ABD

0xB04A0E33
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xC84DD7E6
coming."
0x54927453

0xB04A0E33
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x31F829F0
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0x3FACDC9D
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0xF1A57A22

0xB04A0E33
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x1FAB2B82
worst at once!"
0xFA03ED95

0xB04A0E33
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x11BEDDEB
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0x6489ED75
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xBDF523C8

0xB04A0E33
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x522B2FC9
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0xD265A914

0xB04A0E33
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0x851E7F5E
by an effort, he added--
0x3F111A14

0xB04A0E33
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x9F37D810
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x4508D301
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x24F2B245
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x24E09C0E
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0xA45AC36C
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x2E372C8E
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0xC97C9E84
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x9DDAD566
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x8FD5B5AB

0xB04A0E33
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x36154F94
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x5ACFE2FE
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x08C6BEE1
had left it.
0x10938529

0xB04A0E33
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x21C98F73
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0xE3FA2E36
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x290EAB92
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x07BB2C13
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xBDD023AE
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0xC7E650D9
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0xB758BC33
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x38E2DB4C
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0xE7AD73E7
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x68604103

0xB04A0E33
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x8DFC217C
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x1BD7133D
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x2B26CF7C
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0xC883C4C1
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x8980919A
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x01D7F9E3
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0xDCACCD6A

0xB04A0E33
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0xA76B7646

0xB04A0E33
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x1B305125

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And dressed?"
0x214A7C73

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Come out, then, quietly."
0xF37689E0

0xB04A0E33
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0xAE73DEB0

0xB04A0E33
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x9C520178
noise."
0x4DBACBB6

0xB04A0E33
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x5E6EB532
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x03D94555
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x94BC48C4
side.
0x2C7D851D

0xB04A0E33
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0xB8FBFB3C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x37F04CBB

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Go back and fetch both."
0x944FF85F

0xB04A0E33
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0x046AADAB
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x8BB6BBB5
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x4766A642
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xC87E7345

0xB04A0E33
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x3464A5C2

0xB04A0E33
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0x46836B86

0xB04A0E33
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x42866C60

0xB04A0E33
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x77337E12
fit."
0xB39B7C81

0xB04A0E33
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0xF2E35776
the key and opened the door.
0xDFFF69B2

0xB04A0E33
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x14248F48
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x29773F18
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x3D7B47B5
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x7974A26B
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0xECBC5A3D
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x84FEE535
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x8851F1DF
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0xE163B004
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0x84FB1A7D
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x79054323
came out and closed the door behind him.
0x9BC1DFEA

0xB04A0E33
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0xC3BF67A7
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x29DF5165
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x5F15CC03
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0xC106CB73
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x663BB12F
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0xF2FD96B2
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0xCAE0F6A6
blood.
0xC7CA05C2

0xB04A0E33
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x5B9D691E
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x4C3C2457
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0x7F7BA9F0
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0xBA3201D9
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0xDDA37251
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xD027D9DB
blood, trickling fast down.
0x39618DD4

0xB04A0E33
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0xF12BB218

0xB04A0E33
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xBEC05AF7
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0x3C8F76CD
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0x3771CEA8

0xB04A0E33
"Sir?"
0x4A6427AA

0xB04A0E33
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x5942F510
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x10C0E0BE
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x55E490D9
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0xA7F77C40
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0xE04FF779
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x39C083B7
consequences."
0xE07315D4

0xB04A0E33
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x6F9630A0
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xC3218EF4
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x768BA629
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x04A5D5EC
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0xBE8B8318
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x0BE58FFF
step ceased to be heard.
0xC931070C

0xB04A0E33
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xA45D4B0B
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x786C3865
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x489B072D
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x4E388886
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0xFC1F5A28

0xB04A0E33
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x33C34178
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x10D97AB7
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xC36B5BD6
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x05D1D447
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0xB1AA6DB0
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0x2BD21FBD
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x4E28E9DB
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0x35CFACA9
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x3CF9CFF3
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x4F74CA95
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x20408144
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x849142A0

0xB04A0E33
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x1346F319
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x61A36B31
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x061F4216
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0x21002977
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0x31242BC0
subordinate's form.
0xFF494388

0xB04A0E33
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0xA15273B0
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x4032D018
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x834B62DA
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0x636490BF
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x6E495371

0xB04A0E33
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x741187A8
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x2BD1E0F0
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x9B9CE3B2
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0xC0E14C61
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x1D2F862C
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0x6A57E20E

0xB04A0E33
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0x3D9015E1
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x4AFA62FC
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x2321C835
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0xA20A2AD0
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x8025733D
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xCA284BAB
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0x7DBBEECC
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x747BDEF2
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x5FF17950
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xD0DA3BDE
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x362B2A5E
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0xF66ACBD0
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0x0DDBF45D
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x2198FE93
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0xBE16C8DE
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x70FBA2F7
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0xD045AB87
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x2EC3E368
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0xB43DC300

0xB04A0E33
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x39D35850
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0xAACF738B
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0xD3B7E9D9
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0xE7CC51D9
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x873725C1

0xB04A0E33
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0xB1BD8C7A
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x26343796
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x37F71D39
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0x2598B0F9
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xBE87623B
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x01B75C2D
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xD4833D8D
I might not even speak to him.
0x269CD7D5

0xB04A0E33
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x99DA9FA3
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xDA545C29
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x7B6E8591
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x0966D7A9
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0x37F7FF6C
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0xD66B0CD9
shorter.
0xAC239ED4

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0x5EF74127

0xB04A0E33
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0x6620DEAA
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x5E628964
patient downstairs and all."
0xD4EF465E

0xB04A0E33
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x10440678

0xB04A0E33
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x22E91AA4
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x15EFFFF0

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x938EFFD6
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0xEA53D630
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x9AC96688
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0xCA25916E

0xB04A0E33
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x71175BB8

0xB04A0E33
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0x2B144C92

0xB04A0E33
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x054FEE41
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0x8911FE53
there's no danger."
0x4C6D9BB5

0xB04A0E33
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x83478B6E
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xB9BB9C3A
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x6C3C2BBE
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x4F9BFFB9
here!"
0x403B277A

0xB04A0E33
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x445D99EB
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x332AFF1F

0xB04A0E33
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0xD43B6236
said Mr. Rochester.
0x9D47B0FB

0xB04A0E33
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x88822FA6
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0xDD8C815B
looked so quiet at first."
0x7329896B

0xB04A0E33
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0xA4D8C24B
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x5F825DCF
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x8500F37C
alone."
0xD12C98F4

0xB04A0E33
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xC70DA1A9

0xB04A0E33
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0xB9B5DBB9
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x5B046FAC
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0x96183DB3
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xC328A213

0xB04A0E33
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x49FA6222
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x4D90260A

0xB04A0E33
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0xC5B7F752

0xB04A0E33
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x496737BA
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x5C2602EE
said--
0x873BFE59

0xB04A0E33
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0xC04E895F
it."
0xF16E1E7A

0xB04A0E33
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0xC72FBD44

0xB04A0E33
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x68C51E58
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0x4EA7C85C
think of her at all."
0x515854E1

0xB04A0E33
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0x57DF55DD

0xB04A0E33
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xA69463FC
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0xAB36F753
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0xA997FB5A
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0x972EDB42
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x78E7F022
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x34F76AF0
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x8F1ED8C8

0xB04A0E33
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x374C054B
and returned with them.
0x5636B4F8

0xB04A0E33
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0xA04C2CD7
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0x332903DC

0xB04A0E33
I retired as directed.
0x0E66CAB0

0xB04A0E33
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x6A14BFEF
Rochester presently.
0x99660FA6

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x30C7856F

0xB04A0E33
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x8D18CE44
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x873DFD13
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0xEC85637C
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xA3357CA2
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x2A7180F1
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xD01B7B91
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0xC6854CB2

0xB04A0E33
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x1CFB86A4
edged with fur.
0xF31B6151

0xB04A0E33
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xD8BB736B
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x5F4D6942
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0x0362BBC2
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x11F1C174
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xF9588641

0xB04A0E33
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0xF6BB214B

0xB04A0E33
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x02D98F6D
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x20DB0B50
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x9C67DE71
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0x259D5FBA
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xF64DABA9

0xB04A0E33
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x05D105BA
the washstand.
0x1180CB27

0xB04A0E33
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0x41CDFA7D

0xB04A0E33
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x4055C84C
to Mason.
0x42B9D26C

0xB04A0E33
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0xC9F75785

0xB04A0E33
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0x1E845866

0xB04A0E33
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x3344B174

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0x93A14C56
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0xB8F1F3FB
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xDBB2CBBE
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x6339ABBB

0xB04A0E33
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0xF80CB1E8

0xB04A0E33
The patient rose.
0xF6ECCEFF

0xB04A0E33
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x8F6D7C71
step out--that's it!"
0xE5236FD5

0xB04A0E33
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x5AB8844E

0xB04A0E33
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xB855B064
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x334D6E36
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x7199054A
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x271238B9
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0xEE286C77

0xB04A0E33
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x1B024E72
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x75303C49
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x04D49CA9
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0xB04E6A18
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x6D79F49B
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xEFC0B28A
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x590BFC4E
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0xA8BE8CF4
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0xD9024A86
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x4F342F4E
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0xADC19AD3
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x2F5348F5

0xB04A0E33
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x3C73A0FD
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0x1DEB8265
chaise; Carter followed.
0x747868EF

0xB04A0E33
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0x1E254B2F
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x7B2C4A08
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x0A1AB99F

0xB04A0E33
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0xA52896A3

0xB04A0E33
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x9802504F
Dick."
0x1CB26698

0xB04A0E33
"Fairfax--"
0xAAD38074

0xB04A0E33
"Well what is it?"
0xF4452212

0xB04A0E33
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x08DB611B
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0x4AECEEA9

0xB04A0E33
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x41F0DE27
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x59200485

0xB04A0E33
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x95F20B0E
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0x05A247B5

0xB04A0E33
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xC3552B00
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0xF61E37A0
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0x8A2F2690
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x5C8084B5

0xB04A0E33
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0xA20200E5
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0xB1B63123

0xB04A0E33
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x8D606B2F

0xB04A0E33
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0xDA2ECB1C
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0x42C26DA3
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0xF544310E
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xED360312
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x6552214E
pure."
0xA9A6B15F

0xB04A0E33
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x3F432DDD
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0xEA1BDB24
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x0A49EE7E
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0xC045FF1C
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x77A5D65D
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0xF29C6D58
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0xECA2AFDC
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x611E057B

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x88B6E06A

0xB04A0E33
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0xF1AF8715
me.
0x6009299D

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you, sir."
0x40FB00DE

0xB04A0E33
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x24887940
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0xEC2E5FC7
atmosphere?"
0x174D5933

0xB04A0E33
"I do, very much."
0xBD491678

0xB04A0E33
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x59B0A4C1

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x5D148A7F
with Mason?"
0x781AC98F

0xB04A0E33
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x4D6E0749

0xB04A0E33
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x42ACBF2E
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x066BAD31
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0xD5843B46

0xB04A0E33
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x06A5003C

0xB04A0E33
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0x0A33012A
thoughts."
0x98B30581

0xB04A0E33
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0xCA992665

0xB04A0E33
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0x6558FC4F

0xB04A0E33
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0xE72A38ED

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xB61A6CB3
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x0DE25D6F
spue fire any day."
0x9E77C104

0xB04A0E33
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0xA7EC3CEC
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0x40187995
you."
0x2632D859

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0xFE5EA69A
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x3C55FC86
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0x44AD282A

0xB04A0E33
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x8BE4F2E9
how to avert the danger."
0x0CD07848

0xB04A0E33
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x4393B851
from him.
0xEF1BC090

0xB04A0E33
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0xB8398CCF
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0xE684E371
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xC66D0081
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0xD9325BAE
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0xD8723BC4
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0x6B23E735
friend, are you not?"
0xC853AFE3

0xB04A0E33
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0xF925D633

0xB04A0E33
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0xCCC533CC
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0xEFC3BA81
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0x312B009F
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0x52AF7FAF
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x47176A6E
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x75F8902E
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xDA68DBB0
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0xF4BD61E9
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x49E21563
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x970AB414
me at once."
0xE51C6B90

0xB04A0E33
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x62B39845
you are very safe."
0x361AB0B9

0xB04A0E33
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x0AB0B584

0xB04A0E33
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x932DB1C2
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0x4756D85C
before him.
0x9718E36B

0xB04A0E33
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x4BEC2FE4
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x412B5F9F

0xB04A0E33
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x4FE79B75

0xB04A0E33
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x4E975591
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xEF7C4EF6
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0xB95F6DC9
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0xFEDE248B
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x6E0BF7F1
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x9E7720D6

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir; I am content."
0x1BB38852

0xB04A0E33
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0x779E0677
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x34B54CB6
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x3CFD3BF9
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x7918E78A
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x541EA8BF
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0xB4A1E422
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xF251DBD2
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0xF952AFE3
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xD906D40E
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x44AD6379
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x3FC58F7D
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0xDD7C3CE3
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x26977DF9
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x2EA59FF0
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0xE90CEF7B
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0xED828ACB
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x8589E130
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x05D09FE2
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x5E294B8A
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0xF5432EF5
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x3E043FB6
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0xAC06948F
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x0111423D
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0xE6D3E4A7
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0xE54492C9
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x97AAA758
judgment approves?"
0x422ECF2C

0xB04A0E33
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0x7AE6FE96
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xE61768AC
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x3A1EC8D5
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x0EFFB7A1
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x5FE083C8

0xB04A0E33
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xADA7A967

0xB04A0E33
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x7C95228B
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0xBC94A318
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0x241932E6
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0x50192E0C

0xB04A0E33
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x61C20B11
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x3188A128
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x5B1337E6
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0xA50CD762
amend and solace to heal."
0x5479F856

0xB04A0E33
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0xDCC74B17
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0xA2EFBB3E
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0xD8618A12
instrument for my cure in--"
0x08B884F1

0xB04A0E33
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0x8FC08385
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x10FF38BB
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0xC387B107
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0xB0B6C993
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x4D75E305

0xB04A0E33
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0xF9D5085D
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0xB18C30DF
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x5AC1601B
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xAFC2AE36

0xB04A0E33
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x71BE49DF
came back he was humming a tune.
0x37E1B402

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x70ABF303
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0xA5E91E1C

0xB04A0E33
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x61028922

0xB04A0E33
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x29E85804
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0x9BB91E19
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0xA7DED123

0xB04A0E33
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0x8EE821DD

0xB04A0E33
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0x2786B709
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x2FCEF7B4
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0x49555B42

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x06E82238

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x0D8A6A25
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x84D24EA7
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0xC703FCC4

0xB04A0E33
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0xDF2B047E
cheerfully--
0x033BE8CB

0xB04A0E33
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0x6AD504C4
I rose at four to see him off."
0x67B4EA5F

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXI
0xBBF22E67

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x7569854A
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x171262CD
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0xB4C6310A
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0xFBF10E7C
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x3B2780AA
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0xE28C6C7E
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x1C36D587
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0x3681FA3D
man.
0xC49A8935

0xB04A0E33
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0x37A97E4E
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x5C139C70
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x78DEB3F6
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0xF6DE9483
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0xF119171D
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x2026995B
little sister.
0x4B395272

0xB04A0E33
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0x347942B5
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0x574F9A97
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x7C2EAD14
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xF14F7531
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0xFB6DCB82
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x3A2C12A3
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x6B504810
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x7C03381A
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x04339593

0xB04A0E33
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0xE029F009
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x75E9EFAE
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x440F0FAD
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x1D4DD438
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0xD3D055BC
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xB94EF957
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0x9F366511
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x42FFE272
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x33C833CA

0xB04A0E33
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xE18B2F44
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x23AA8047
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0xE0D9627E

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x9628F9B9
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0xE624414A
are married to Bessie?"
0xA400BCC4

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xACAEAB5E
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x6DA165A9
child are thriving."
0xAB8F1351

0xB04A0E33
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0x671942DC

0xB04A0E33
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x4035E8DC
badly at present--in great trouble."
0x9CAC36C3

0xB04A0E33
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x849BCD77
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0xD9DFBFBB

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0x8B5DFC39

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. John?"
0x9E72168A

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x625D4210

0xB04A0E33
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0xE4061B8D
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0xA384C2F9
his death was shocking."
0x727207AE

0xB04A0E33
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x2D0477A7

0xB04A0E33
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x33F2F2F0
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x13539557
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x18BEE21C
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x73C00880
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x891D849F
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0x5353433F
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x7B7093D3
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x79554CA8
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0xC224F6D6

0xB04A0E33
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0xC8CC291E

0xB04A0E33
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x4E9DAB6C
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x3C5D19AD
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0xD0211871
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x6111E165
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0xD7E4B2E3
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x5CFC3FB8
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0xF0B55601
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0x9325C24F
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x0E20B59C
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0xC8246CC1
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x10E489FB
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x1ED859D6
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0xD6F257E0
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0xECC4A5AF
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x263B3ADE
morning."
0x01921458

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xE7132142

0xB04A0E33
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x253D6054
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x269D3A0D

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x0B33AF0F
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0xEE6ABE3B
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0x96CC7A05

0xB04A0E33
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0xBB51B537
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x2990097D
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x1177788D
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0xED781C4E
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x11342294
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x6F6A06FB
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xC434AACB
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0x3AA0722C
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x3C9E60F8
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x38601B86
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0x58557B89
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xA99B004B
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0xAAE0F82D
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xD173121E
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xCE6C90E2
lineaments.
0xD02C2229

0xB04A0E33
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x3DD4AB11
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x1862B58D
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xF26FEFC9
cue and followed me from the room.
0x59F74CAD

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0x14295BC4
which he had shut.
0xB5E31097

0xB04A0E33
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0x28C9E03F

0xB04A0E33
"What to do?--where to go?"
0xE3688B30

0xB04A0E33
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0x68A15495

0xB04A0E33
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x1B596AB3

0xB04A0E33
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x71721641

0xB04A0E33
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0x40DC2C9D
people to see her that distance?"
0x8D4733E8

0xB04A0E33
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0x4A541083

0xB04A0E33
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0x6E9883B5

0xB04A0E33
"It is his widow, sir."
0x0F6D3554

0xB04A0E33
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x960D1530

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0x842DF1ED

0xB04A0E33
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x99C29608
had no relations."
0x73D83EE4

0xB04A0E33
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x02682248
off."
0x53D81E58

0xB04A0E33
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0xB04A0E33
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x4DDD3838

0xB04A0E33
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0xE0F2FBC7
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0xB0BBDE5C
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0x06F8808C
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0xA4DE28F9
in London."
0xD719CF59

0xB04A0E33
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x9BA1FF98
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0xA85CAE38
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0x624FF416

0xB04A0E33
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0x539E96FF
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0xEE08CADE
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x17F94D3B

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0x654A7D95
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0x677723EA

0xB04A0E33
"How long will you stay?"
0xC86024BE

0xB04A0E33
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0xA6364978

0xB04A0E33
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0x37E63AF6

0xB04A0E33
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0xDC9E7155

0xB04A0E33
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0xD109BA2F
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0xDE3CA652

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0xCC17D952

0xB04A0E33
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x92936E07

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x449F57DA

0xB04A0E33
"A person to be trusted?"
0x6BFAB190

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0xD6086F62

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0x7FB649D7

0xB04A0E33
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x1DD398D2

0xB04A0E33
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0x9539410F
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0x47386995
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0x50C694E0

0xB04A0E33
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x17BBE805
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x8636977B
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0xDD94C3C3
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0xE6A44A3A
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0xF3370DC3

0xB04A0E33
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0x8B8D4CEB

0xB04A0E33
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0xEB615494
if recollecting something, he said--
0xFA1E041D

0xB04A0E33
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0xA8033276
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0xBE711639
plenty?"
0xBA1C346C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0x4455DC0F

0xB04A0E33
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0x22B47680

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0xF700BA0D
while I have the opportunity."
0xB01FBF05

0xB04A0E33
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x6D9B9008

0xB04A0E33
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0x1EF35B53
married?"
0x37B29892

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; what then?"
0xD6E7D5FF

0xB04A0E33
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0x13E6D247
perceive the necessity of it."
0x2013ED06

0xB04A0E33
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x5083EACA
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0x8AD32FF2
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0xA4937C16
straight to--the devil?"
0x72069073

0xB04A0E33
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0x0006DC7B

0xB04A0E33
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0x794205B4
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0xE96B6F12

0xB04A0E33
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0x17A5ADE5
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0x13386B48

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0x8FFA3348
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0xA3366B30

0xB04A0E33
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0x7286C850
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0xF4A11BF8
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x8A7F6DBE

0xB04A0E33
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0x2346B74D
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0xEE7CC5AE

0xB04A0E33
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0x77565919
five pounds, Jane."
0x22E7D021

0xB04A0E33
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0x9C11F63F

0xB04A0E33
"Just let me look at the cash."
0xB117894C

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0xF24E7649

0xB04A0E33
"Jane!"
0xEF1D90AC

0xB04A0E33
"Sir?"
0x4A6427AA

0xB04A0E33
"Promise me one thing."
0xC79DABA6

0xB04A0E33
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0x31E662B2

0xB04A0E33
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0x3507EB03
find you one in time."
0x8187FE4B

0xB04A0E33
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0x0075979D
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0xCFD94728
it."
0xF16E1E7A

0xB04A0E33
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0x41CA340B
then?"
0x4C85FCBB

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir; early."
0x5BA006AD

0xB04A0E33
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0xE43768C8

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0xDF40C624

0xB04A0E33
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0x4B91DA30

0xB04A0E33
"I suppose so, sir."
0xC8B07D1D

0xB04A0E33
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0x7CE7CDA1
not quite up to it."
0xED2A755F

0xB04A0E33
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0xE7E5C566

0xB04A0E33
"Then say it."
0xF75CD29C

0xB04A0E33
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x2835B0D5

0xB04A0E33
"What must I say?"
0x91A70C3E

0xB04A0E33
"The same, if you like, sir."
0x1F5EB8F3

0xB04A0E33
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0x8BDE2BC6

0xB04A0E33
"Yes?"
0xB458066A

0xB04A0E33
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0x55C06647
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0xC31EBF4C
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0xDD02A7F2
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0xED1765E4

0xB04A0E33
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0xA8F0F517
as in many."
0x6D67FA09

0xB04A0E33
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0x83207A96

0xB04A0E33
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x904F7E50
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0x765A09DB
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x8410579B
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x2935DE8F

0xB04A0E33
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0x8590B9E1
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x72AB8CF4
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0xDAC77C15
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0x737252B3
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0x76C1D53A
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0xC01FC8BA

0xB04A0E33
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0x2C67EC8A

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0xC7C98950
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0xF9143967

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0x09E9D0DA
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x5A2FFFB7
will finally recover."
0x597C1C91

0xB04A0E33
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0x8BA34F45

0xB04A0E33
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x9C7CD2BC
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x0E51BAE0
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0x8D7A21A4
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0x49F4F2B8
and then I will go up with you?"
0xA14FE8B9

0xB04A0E33
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x1706F848
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0x5D28467D
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x305C6555
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0x023BFF5D
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x52FB6C4A

0xB04A0E33
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0xE50677C8
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x018D269A
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x778154A0
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0xE742164B
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0x8EF5ED5D
looks.
0xE51D1A0D

0xB04A0E33
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0xBF56D96C
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x20AF735E
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x5AEE5268
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0x3620AE11
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x7946ACAA
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0xB03289E6

0xB04A0E33
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0x199C14CD
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x0B8A38DD
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x3DC46891
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x257A2C41
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0xF0425F23
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x57A92F00
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x5540D7EA

0xB04A0E33
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x76CF2F45
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x47EEF3B6
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x0F90E1BA
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0xD4BD8EFB
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x7C4816A7
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x76681F7F
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x5CA2AEBD
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x6C26C9C6
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0x06B48957
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x2252769F
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xE7738C58
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0xBCCEE6CA

0xB04A0E33
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0xC0AAF7E7
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x730855B3

0xB04A0E33
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x513642D2
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0x2BA0CC7C
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x8FC4FB42
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x127BD19B
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x1CD9DE03
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x8E8EF9C0
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x93AB7578
past recognition.
0x786AEE5A

0xB04A0E33
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0x2F1E08C9
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0xC0FA9325
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xA216E9C0
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x6A70DDB2
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0x660204BD
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xEACE5E8D
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x3AAD76C9
colourless visage.
0x2F13AA7E

0xB04A0E33
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x987428FA
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x68691443
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0xB60CF357
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x5E1D1B74
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0xEBB971FB
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x6D268207
other's looked puritanical.
0xA965B569

0xB04A0E33
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0x1AFC5A3B
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xB14683C1
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0xBA5AFB00
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x5FC9BE86
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x176B45B0

0xB04A0E33
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x37B25BA2
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x905676C8
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x3A5B21F6
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0x268CEEB9
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x8AB6EE49
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0xEF1FADF2
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0x0FF37814
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x2148F656
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0x2B75C68B
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x2F1E8FAB
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xF5341E35
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0x4C3672BF
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0xDD637738

0xB04A0E33
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0xCB4737E3
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0xB2C055A0
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x29D75430
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x8A654184
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0xC42F0A98
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x90BB9B77
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0xA626927B
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x331CB66F
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0xE1F7F4AF

0xB04A0E33
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0xD2D92420
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x9DDC38B1
liberty.
0x1DD20E1E

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x81714AA5
can see her to-night."
0x65CDFC7D

0xB04A0E33
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x7E79B62E
should be much obliged to you."
0x05AE61E5

0xB04A0E33
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0xC45B4974
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x8D6167A0
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0xDA019F23

0xB04A0E33
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xF574A6FF
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x90CD3A79
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0xAE302192
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0xEA413752
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0xA9D28DED
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x10E7069A
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x756C0553
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x976B674C
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x126260F9
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x1A4F1BE9
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x8F9C76A4
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x738D2226
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x416CD820
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x72112B5A
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0xAAF13812

0xB04A0E33
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0xF2402485
us see if she will know you."
0xA007947F

0xB04A0E33
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0x34E91968
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x1D9C4316
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x8B5DAEFC
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x84C08D0B
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0xFBD1E41F
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x03713923
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0xBDA83219
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0xA2CA8A9A
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0xA6C0E980
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0xCEDE288C
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xAA386498

0xB04A0E33
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0xACB27FA7
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x21B803C6
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0x69C8F3B8
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x02755AB9
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x8023E38D
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0x2DCFB355
amity.
0x90E39163

0xB04A0E33
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0xEF4E3284
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x766A254D
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x4D045380
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x68B862F9
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0xC7B25094
she looked at me.
0x78B9A653

0xB04A0E33
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0xD9EEC1FE

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0xB240EEB1

0xB04A0E33
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x9C19E984
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xAB51601C
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x1172A19B
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0xF1803D95
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x861FA91D
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0xEB7D14CF
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0xDBE2CB8D
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x704B7F3D
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x9978CA2A
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0x48B752F4
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x0E83E727
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0x74B5AC6A

0xB04A0E33
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0x0EE35190
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x3BCF48DC
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x2D06BD9C
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x5180CACB
the pillow.
0xD4434817

0xB04A0E33
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xE1CFE007
till I see how you get on."
0x186DEE00

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x0BFC4188

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xBB9B0BF0
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x6E81BCE1
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x9B2A93F4
say--let me see--"
0xD920DC43

0xB04A0E33
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0xEB424985
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x81E5A3FD
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0xACF506A4
was at once irritated.
0x363DBB86

0xB04A0E33
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x87E273FD
you Jane Eyre?"
0x87F87045

0xB04A0E33
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x416FD89E

0xB04A0E33
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x4022221B
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x77C632AF
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x22304A81
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0x45F79BAF
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0xE3F68F22
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x4ACB4812
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x3D84400C
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x2590DC6E
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x24D84CDF

0xB04A0E33
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0xA82CF636

0xB04A0E33
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0xA0D4BF5F
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0xB5275571
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0x83EA4E49
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0xA80FCA27
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0xBB746655
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x0D0B780D
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0xF75952E1
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x3DDC434C
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x1F6114BE
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x59DDC6F2
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x4715211A
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x4CD78C57
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x2B8293B0
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0xFE9B395E
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0xB52CBBFA
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0x1C316C8F
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xC4EE93FB
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xE8DE00FD
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0x8B8C92E0
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x34A9C188
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x25940BEC
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x1B0D8218
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xCF19F530
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0xE0D0A5FE

0xB04A0E33
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x9FD2F1C4
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x2065AB54

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0xC6500FF3
the morning she is calmer."
0x3C74F58B

0xB04A0E33
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xEC8797C6
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x61E9D630
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x4761AFA7
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x9EA645C2
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x2432801F
had?"
0x218E3EEE

0xB04A0E33
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x30AD6A8C
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x1C1E92A0
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0xD45AE69B

0xB04A0E33
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0xBCE7F8BF
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0xA460C1C5
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x86DAD052
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x4467E1FE
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xAD8AA27D
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xC4387354
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0xA7B1D75B
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x52BB4325
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0x7B391C76
for both.
0xE40AC7BB

0xB04A0E33
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0xE823F2F4
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x31D33CC3
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x660D6821
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0xE35294D4
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0xC792F7AE
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x5553C180
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x0115A4D8
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0x62FFEC25

0xB04A0E33
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0xD2842139
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x9D9256EB
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x4EEFA6FA
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0x4FB2E4E9
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x341D185D
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x3D614EBB
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0xBBA5C146
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0xB1317398
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0x5B3D1917
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x11B81BE5
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0xE40A28A0
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0x31410D92
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xB719AA51
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0xAEC641D9
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x48D8406F
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xA8CCCC98
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x6BCEA2D9
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0xE7AD251E
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0x4D6F7EA2
and content.
0x78AE70A0

0xB04A0E33
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0xCCED0144
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0x930EEA58
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x8BD04CE7
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0x54F99B65
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x15A10FC1
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0xBE5BDC45
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x6654589E
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0x510238F1
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0xAA061292
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x302EF9E3
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x3BC5C3E8
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0x4592F6CB
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0x1A87F2B4
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x13EA650D
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0xCB872BA4
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x6B58D6BF
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0xA01A522B
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xAC4E0E8E
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x888CA263
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0xD7AD9BE3
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x9E32BB22
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x98FA3E82
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0x1BF97D8F
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0xF17A7D59
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x3E89084B

0xB04A0E33
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0xA50DA832
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0xD7CB7B76
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xC6A9E261
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x13842951
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0x3A14FAC1
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0xED57467E
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x3056B79A
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0xB3446BFB
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0xE3611522
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x40D56542
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0xE9EB335D
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x83A68B8D
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x7BAFBDB9
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x3A5B8311
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x53075848
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x8870C936
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x67B99217
vary its clockwork regularity.
0xAF750D07

0xB04A0E33
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0xF3E78CB7
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x0424FB00
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0xC5759FB3
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0xF3E112F5
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0xA94AF741
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x4ED885C6
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0xF9961107
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0xAB740ABB
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0xEECD9342
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x078929B9

0xB04A0E33
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x3B999BD4
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0x08C45909
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x7CCD1E56

0xB04A0E33
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0xE5F0DFAA
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0x4A0F0A6B
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x6E3AA135
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0xFA0F5D50
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x097AB4DA
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0x1D21BF11
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0x25EC6A2A
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x0DF8B538
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0x32CC0C6A
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x3AE9B745
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x710515A8

0xB04A0E33
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x2E78531E
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x74ADB5BB
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x395D333D
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x82674128
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0xAAA2385A
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0xB5AA19FB
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0xC3AE8DC6
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x7D2C4331
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0xB920FD17
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0xD7E57F4B
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xCF1E4419
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x659D1788
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x6EACBCD8
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x9FF309A2
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x3859DBEF
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0xEF520252
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x22160FB8
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x51FC5065
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0xECDF99B4
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x82D23762
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0xF0CD6511
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0xCD691252
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0xAB57A283
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x13E07003
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x6002E607
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xE76F66A9
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0xF82FA7A9
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x46C680CB
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xCCD00392
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x3742F593
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0x21AFA1AF
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x8ADFC580

0xB04A0E33
She closed her lips.
0xB1A5E6B8

0xB04A0E33
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x8596D419
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0xBEED02C8
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x2F5072E6
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0xAEE89C76
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x272316CE
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x580FDF46
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x33645718
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x51CBD4F3
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0x8DB257D0

0xB04A0E33
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0x7398D32C
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x58E6365B
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xC9A22600
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0xC58726AB
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x10024051

0xB04A0E33
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0xE0965C8D
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x0B1DECF3
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x49BC2582
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x8A4748D4
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x0883162B
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0xC32A2823

0xB04A0E33
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x44C2C8D3
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0x09A82170
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x6C681C98
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x4CFD8F4C
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x9FC2C6D5
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x5A9B8111
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x635505F1
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x4CC42063
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0xD5C10448
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x0CE10E84

0xB04A0E33
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0xBD2324A2
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x729E87A0
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0xA0E120F4
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0xA8823EBF

0xB04A0E33
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x95F5F2CD
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xA052C9C7
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0xAB628C79
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0xA3D95150
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x1684813D
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0xB23C5851
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x1655FAAF

0xB04A0E33
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x753D8D02
her.
0xEEA21E27

0xB04A0E33
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x91EE1444

0xB04A0E33
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x76FCBDB6
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x40E60C56
me--where is Bessie?"
0x8F7A53AA

0xB04A0E33
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x1D173C5A

0xB04A0E33
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0x1EDF0253
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0xA8260CA4
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x1BF0A553

0xB04A0E33
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xED36F1CF
identity.
0xBC65ABE9

0xB04A0E33
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x11A0E72B
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0xFA86A63A
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x84F33A98
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x8195260E
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0x43A52A16
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xB0359AF8

0xB04A0E33
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0xB504CDDD
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xDF5A2EF4
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x2C5F0942
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0x8B278375
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x9E345716

0xB04A0E33
I assured her we were alone.
0x0C56F75F

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xD41ED502
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x69BAC3B9
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x8253AB89
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x8651F82A
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0xE2DE7076

0xB04A0E33
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xD0EE7C2A
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x1A6C9710
of the last pang.
0x100A54ED

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0xC83C4DF0
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x726D40B3
there."
0x66FB0B90

0xB04A0E33
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0xDE7CEE2D

0xB04A0E33
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xA679BF9B

0xB04A0E33
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0xC1F40649
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x9B00C79A
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0xA80DD86C
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x01265745
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0xD77E379E
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x4A0D8E1F

0xB04A0E33
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0xC832E351

0xB04A0E33
It was dated three years back.
0x9490F890

0xB04A0E33
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x6E26D97A

0xB04A0E33
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x9BC5F0C3
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x32B5335F
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x1763B1B0
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x1ED430F0
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x72F3A49B
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x87673CF2
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0xF94B1258
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0xB44B9EE8
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0x057B59BB
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x08F3D144

0xB04A0E33
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0x613A96D6
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x24BDC07A
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0xD7138B2B
passed since that day."
0xC32BBA85

0xB04A0E33
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0xA0F1916A
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x56450214

0xB04A0E33
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x01C6AFF7
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x2071F11B
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0xCE5907F9
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x38DC9E05
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x399C8249
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x72E3314A
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0xAEEAB854
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0xC86FFB0F

0xB04A0E33
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0xDF7CC952
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0xD10AEFA7

0xB04A0E33
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0x28DCCE89
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xB97DDD1D
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x9F024419
violence, I can never comprehend."
0xB41461B1

0xB04A0E33
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x110E82EC
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0xCA7713FF
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0x93CA9C56
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x95AF4F17

0xB04A0E33
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x01852C08
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0xE030B9B9
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x6B216313
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x584AA68B
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0xA238B05B

0xB04A0E33
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x7DDBF0A3
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0xD1C605B4

0xB04A0E33
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x39E86A68
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x10364996
she must hate me still.
0xBCB1CD1A

0xB04A0E33
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x73DD32B8
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xDAEB76C8
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0xEC6D3719
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x0013CD23
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0xC0B5269B
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0xBD0D45BA
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x69D4A9CB
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0x9C9AE72A
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0xB8E459BA
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x8C15E007
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xF834F6DA
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x6037B4C7
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0xD25AE361
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x5A1AFCDF
form.
0x52F13A96

0xB04A0E33
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0xF71C7BE5
observed--
0x1B92C1AE

0xB04A0E33
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0xDB4DBADB
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x0D2BE99E
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0xCA5AD443
Neither of us had dropt a tear.
0x17CE4D9A

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXII
0x30ABFB1A

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x6CBB7FED
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0xDE314BCF
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x37E5D9BD
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0xF628EB63
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x09B993D4
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0xD279FEB8
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x030FE27E
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0xF52D7B12
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x02B2D55B
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0xB4B95ACA
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0xFEFF4FAA
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0xD9614204
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0xE16E80E5
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x949ECEED
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x82510256
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0xB368EA14
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0x8B8209E5
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x5E5F0713
patient and compliant on my part."
0x47BD7BC1

0xB04A0E33
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x2654220B
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0xF248218D
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0xE7BF4A7D
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0xC7165111
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x5B1E6531
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0x613FCE9D
notes of condolence.
0x6DFD7467

0xB04A0E33
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xFB0CDD28
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x3EB2BA97
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0x4D38CDEB
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0x2B5E5596
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0xB3FAA95D
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x529D514B
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0xDADF493F
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0xB824C5D5
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0xF5BDC2C8
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xD573CD4A
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0xE9BDF518
veil."
0x90861C8A

0xB04A0E33
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x844EDAFA
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x38E5AF50
good may it do you!"
0xB83370CD

0xB04A0E33
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x4A8BA5E9
you have some sense."
0x1DCF209E

0xB04A0E33
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x6B14D413
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x85033CB9
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xEA4AF042
much care."
0x8E9F65C1

0xB04A0E33
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x405CFA0F
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x6EA28992
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xE22ABA59
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x2D3CE8A0
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0xB5EF8804
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x17FC7CEC
fortune.
0x918C8679

0xB04A0E33
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x60099DEF
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0xE93F665D
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x0C25C4DB
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x1A1C6B23
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0xC3B9FBCF
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0x6BE37E4C
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x72227609
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x4975610A
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0xD0600F58

0xB04A0E33
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0xB5CEAF91
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x6B22E7A1
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x171A39ED
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0x5F029F6A
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0xDB971B5E
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0xFA21950C
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x9A73F879
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x8776593D
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x5BA3C99C
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0xDCEDFB21
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xA2AE85EF
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x4B1D4F7B

0xB04A0E33
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xDE9AE5E8
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x6A0825F8
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0x4CE78268
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0xB6270824
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0x1E3ADA97
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x0B2105AB
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xE5C9C6AF
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x3DC2324F
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x90748130
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x5F3C2791
don't doubt it."
0x6AFCF820

0xB04A0E33
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x16F300AF
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xAB76812C
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0x36D64B3B
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0x155E24FF
both her and me.
0x14B918E5

0xB04A0E33
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xAFFDB063
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x4D38644D
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x470F0C7D
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0x0BD1BC06
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x125F1140
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x2A2CC4DB

0xB04A0E33
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xB7C0A1E3
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x95DD1016
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x9F4F7D0A
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x5ADB1430
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x88EDF095
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0xC297EB74
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0xF31FF05E

0xB04A0E33
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0xAFB131C0
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x57F9C604
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x5A99AF9D
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xE30D564D
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0x3AB35351
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0xB87B9E5A
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x9E4CFA47

0xB04A0E33
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x4BC620EA
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x54E3C268
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xB0BD3294
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0xA6BE483B
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xEC774F55
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x2B704992
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0x36750087

0xB04A0E33
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x67DB25F1
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0xA3ECFB9F
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x5255FF5C
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0xA993B70F
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0xF3A7E87A
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0x07D4F518
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x4B0603F0
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0xBC4B5998

0xB04A0E33
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x0AF7D2D1
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x86B6DC40
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x7F130C2D
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0xD59F1967
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xA894FF58
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0xE91FB76C

0xB04A0E33
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0xE9622F3D
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xC307B571

0xB04A0E33
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x934567CD
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x9AC8AFB7
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0x3116BC60
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x62CCBE01
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x59E67CA9
behave with decent composure.
0xB9FB71AD

0xB04A0E33
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0xC4F50212
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x0AE68D0D
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0xD24FCB1B
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0x4A52A8C6
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0xBC085628
month?"
0xAA749F39

0xB04A0E33
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."

"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0xDB50289E
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0xD93D6B2F
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x15D39E6C
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x549F24F6
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0xBC27D31E
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x0E953A22
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x414314B4

0xB04A0E33
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x91D6BDB6
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x53F43D8C
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x9C30944D
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x74E613FD
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x77574938
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x4982FAE3
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0x385587BB
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x8BDA9020
that it were my home!
0x1B8F29D7

0xB04A0E33
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x21057361
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xE3EADE58

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0xD86DAA2B

0xB04A0E33
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x25A67D55

0xB04A0E33
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0x14CDB94A

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0xD74B27CC

0xB04A0E33
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x0CE82AAC
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x12EBCA77
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0xACC7AE35
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0x6735B537
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x9F2623F1
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0xF44BD040

0xB04A0E33
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x6A3C761F
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0xC51A8388
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x3C54E2C1

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0xB127C968
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0xD74E7ED9
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0xD40C8CE9
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x2B325D0E
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0x0E6026B7
shed it over me now.
0x2D3C689C

0xB04A0E33
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0xE7410067
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x01E6867D

0xB04A0E33
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x93BDA9C3
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0xE8BF8656
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x7D2C0E8B
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xCA57F446

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0x42957FE4
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0x44C20335

0xB04A0E33
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x7466CBA2
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x804083D0
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x9442557F
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x7DFF1DDF
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xCF2E4189
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x25620D43

0xB04A0E33
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x98834134
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x43ABE262
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x22E5EA29
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0x9A41A320
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x5F45BFA6
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0xA4A7C204
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x6BDB630F
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x89844659
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x45DE798C
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x76143C71
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x0E9EE7FD
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x27DC221B
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0xD32F4344
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x1CB4F8A8

0xB04A0E33
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x2AF70DC7
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0xA47B0588
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0x2062ED21
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x4FF08028
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x340F469E
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0xE5A92E83
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xE9834611

0xB04A0E33
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x85B7B61E
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0x26FC429B
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0xBE515C2E
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0xC8861D6F
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x45F6DE07
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0xCDC61907
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x12503D07
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0xED688996
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x8A654398
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0xEFB7008B
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0xAB3AC587
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0x01A44FAB
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

CHAPTER XXIII
0x3426845F

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0xE41B387E
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x73D395C8
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x4E8BC4FB
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0xFEF0EDB1
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x7B40B075
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x53959393
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x9EC7C1E8
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x15051F0B

0xB04A0E33
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x4549B964
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xE1AAD777
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0xCF9C23C1

0xB04A0E33
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0xD6D7805B
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x684C7358
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x8CE494BC
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x36673CF2
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0x442507C7
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x47F1A83E
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xD98392C9
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xDEB69CAA

0xB04A0E33
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x88292A3B
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x634446F2
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0xBD3986ED
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0xC3DDDC34
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x5FF02529
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x44B655B3
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x28C591B8
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x25DE42EB
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0xB8ED25BC
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0xA5FC577D
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0xE6857E88
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x1AF38996
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xE6D1AA81
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0xCBD689DE
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0x4A4B8DE9

0xB04A0E33
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x7F78883C
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x325F1632
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0xD9F986E9
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x6E921A77
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x0435A13E
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x68D68501
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x5254C373
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0xBFFA1437
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0xE6619A0F

0xB04A0E33
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0xFF8EA82C
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0x8EB72246
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x3856CE98
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0x4BE56826
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0x236C55E3
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0xB7673A97
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0x0F210D3D

0xB04A0E33
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x378EC8B6
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x03D58741

0xB04A0E33
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xD294BF38
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0x7C4C84BA
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0xF3580765
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0xAC9E671A
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x13E574F1
turning--
0xDEAE7086

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x228145D8

0xB04A0E33
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x13AF7CE7
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x6578AF76

0xB04A0E33
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x6F8BB42B
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0x24D564E4
there! he is flown."
0x915AA7E0

0xB04A0E33
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x93977A80
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x31256CDD

0xB04A0E33
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0x8FB4BF0B
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x252207E1
moonrise."
0x674A6BD0

0xB04A0E33
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xFC6B82C4
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x00B47480
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x87F0CADE
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0xBBA61350
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0xDAC75F24
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0xD3C55C98
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0xFF002487
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x65819201
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0xA5667615
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x15514A3B
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x94C67D0B

0xB04A0E33
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x16B12905
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x066B2D26
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0xF8DF1228

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0x3D7E404D
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xE54828EF
Adhesiveness?"
0x229E31E1

0xB04A0E33
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x13C50B8C

0xB04A0E33
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x5F9FBD76
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x8B05FBB5
simple dame Fairfax?"
0xD313897F

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x57EEFE0B

0xB04A0E33
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0xDDAC430A

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xFD6D4DE7
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x9B51F480
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x9D3D9C63
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x46184FFC

0xB04A0E33
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0x729F9281

0xB04A0E33
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0xB4EFB082
must."
0xB537B5D3

0xB04A0E33
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0x4C55F7BF

0xB04A0E33
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0x755D35C5

0xB04A0E33
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0xB90DAA06

0xB04A0E33
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0x343F35D5

0xB04A0E33
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0x54E5691D
straight on the head."
0x3D0E8B3A

0xB04A0E33
"Soon, sir?"
0x32DCAA68

0xB04A0E33
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x410EF76E
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0x87FE2D3C
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x71297486
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x40D446D2
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0xC1113086
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0xE77F0108
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0xEBC49EFD
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0xBA167D74
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0xBC793E38
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x11FB0DF6
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0x831E5E7D
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0xA5F2FCE6
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x875C0788
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x786A2544
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0xD1CC7148
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x00A9AB8E
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x00FC9A83

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xCA54135D
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x1D97F49D
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x054FFE65
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0xF0DA0669

0xB04A0E33
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xC24B88EA
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x71E24DE6
for you."
0xC5AE97DB

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0x44D03247

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0x52BD2080
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0xD1F7D16A
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x33339151
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0xD61AFB00
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0xE86BDC20
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0x81CF7AFD
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0xBDA9E754

0xB04A0E33
"It is a long way off, sir."
0xB9260C4E

0xB04A0E33
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0xF45FA1AB
distance."
0x0D55436F

0xB04A0E33
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0xB8AE84DB

0xB04A0E33
"From what, Jane?"
0x59007A75

0xB04A0E33
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0x6B4E3D8E

0xB04A0E33
"Well?"
0x39D8D737

0xB04A0E33
"From _you_, sir."
0xDB8A459D

0xB04A0E33
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x5B9E8229
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0x05E729D5
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x0D92E3FA
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0xAC59B25C
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x2F8D74A7
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0xD1906CC5
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0x94415B47
loved.
0xB99833BB

0xB04A0E33
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xDC393979

0xB04A0E33
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x126DEE58
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x5DF47ECC
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x6A180B30
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x927B0752

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xF4681EF1
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0x6F5B296C
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x7679A084
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0x8799FA74
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0xB9B87BBB
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x4B9E129A
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x0137963E

0xB04A0E33
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0xBF6CF899
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x67EE1C87
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x667D4C6D

0xB04A0E33
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0xCB1789A2

0xB04A0E33
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x90FFA1D4
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x708C4131
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xDDF31949
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0xAA301DF2
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0xBA110E4D
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0xA3396E5C
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x509C586C
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x110D5C0B

0xB04A0E33
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x76AFAA45

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x9C322300

0xB04A0E33
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0xD7417D46
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x699B15D6
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x47F43B9F
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0x586DB1A9

0xB04A0E33
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0x54C73A90

0xB04A0E33
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0xFD81EDF6
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x4AACDA63
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0xDECBAA9E
speak.
0x01F855ED

0xB04A0E33
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0xFC07A391
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x9E6BA0AF
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x753FF9E5
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x924794EB
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xED94F818
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x05A4DAB5
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x8F4DD9CA
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0x123F4FE0
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0x2C31356D
on the necessity of death."
0xA7DC3478

0xB04A0E33
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x961CC75F

0xB04A0E33
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0xFEE39FBF

0xB04A0E33
"In what shape?"
0x659EB879

0xB04A0E33
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x341C7416

0xB04A0E33
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0x477E65E9

0xB04A0E33
"But you will have."
0xE2C984D5

0xB04A0E33
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x8AA776BA

0xB04A0E33
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x07B5B9DE

0xB04A0E33
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0x7D800BC3

0xB04A0E33
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x5260B3EE
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0x927999E0
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x12ABC193
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0xA4C32707
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0xE65E0701
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0xAA615DA2
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x6B763488
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0x5A400302
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x13190B1D
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0x2B9E93D0
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0xCC3B760B
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0xDC27073F

0xB04A0E33
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x2527D533
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x833365FF
Jane!"
0x9BA2EFC2

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0xFC33AC69
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0x0DAD2789
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x39C7FEE8
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0xFC2E3BA0
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x4E7B5B86

0xB04A0E33
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x1DE1938F

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0xB13311C5

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0xD816F526
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x3AA78C85

0xB04A0E33
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x4EA14837
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xEEBFE187

0xB04A0E33
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x0B7D9B22

0xB04A0E33
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x84E4431F
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0xF7C09A57

0xB04A0E33
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0xD6C01950

0xB04A0E33
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x302E62ED
best earthly companion."
0x0B917138

0xB04A0E33
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0xD3E58FBB

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xA8239F47
too."
0x48914DF2

0xB04A0E33
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x9AFDE976
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x1957AF1A
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x14EDB1B0
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xE4075A3F
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x6C63D5B7
said--
0x873BFE59

0xB04A0E33
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0xBEA174BE

0xB04A0E33
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0xBE2E65FD
return."
0x27BA8260

0xB04A0E33
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0xA72D3F5F

0xB04A0E33
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0xA16C588B

0xB04A0E33
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0x1599421E

0xB04A0E33
"Your bride stands between us."
0xC88D6B55

0xB04A0E33
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0xA767D27E

0xB04A0E33
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0x992ED677
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x24171647

0xB04A0E33
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0xD631747C
was still incredulous.
0x98188A79

0xB04A0E33
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0xCE004870

0xB04A0E33
"Entirely."
0x84980C7B

0xB04A0E33
"You have no faith in me?"
0x7862509F

0xB04A0E33
"Not a whit."
0xE333FC2F

0xB04A0E33
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0x8F216848
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x12C905C8
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x00FAB440
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0xF9B9FD28
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x28194FC2
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x4B07502D
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xE4683343
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x1218140E
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0xE546B7DA

0xB04A0E33
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x666D72B7
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0xBB249C12
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0xF81FC9A1
given me?"
0x1CE75362

0xB04A0E33
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x5D14BC9A
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x4C8BAC55

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0xC0044AAD

0xB04A0E33
"Why?"
0xC62CE56A

0xB04A0E33
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x7894BE22

0xB04A0E33
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x7891F393
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x6AFC46C6

0xB04A0E33
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x2C8A12BF
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x42D531B0

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0xF17EB0B8
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xD7E8C462

0xB04A0E33
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x4541A625
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0xE6FEDF4F

0xB04A0E33
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xA09D346F
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x7ADBFD93

0xB04A0E33
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x7F1FD448
be your wife?"
0xD2D34990

0xB04A0E33
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x8CDB411E

0xB04A0E33
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xAED96E9C

0xB04A0E33
"Edward--my little wife!"
0x0BC4C2B4

0xB04A0E33
"Dear Edward!"
0xCBDD2D1B

0xB04A0E33
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x5626073E
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x55D92C67
happiness--I will make yours."
0x28778ABF

0xB04A0E33
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x18B71C9C
have her, and will hold her."
0x86585D06

0xB04A0E33
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0xDF83C492

0xB04A0E33
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0x1E04B479
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x752C3D2A
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x58A73CAB
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x9DC5EA6C
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x04408293
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x5BDF4FC3
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xE78DF2BF
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x4F8BF108
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0x324A178C
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0xC28B0960
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x810AD48B

0xB04A0E33
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x77AA7E53
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0xCFDB436D
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x65A87FE9
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x6A421A0C

0xB04A0E33
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0xF6C4A866
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x8385BF34

0xB04A0E33
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x33EAF357
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x83D5AB7F
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xCBC332CA
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x70BEBA42

0xB04A0E33
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0xE326F5F6
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xEA68D003
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0xDE199188
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x09F414A6
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x77147016
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xE4D19ABB

0xB04A0E33
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0xE43EC1DF
night--good-night, my darling!"
0xB996DBD3

0xB04A0E33
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x13A66467
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x3A1E3AEC
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0xBA24B601
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x87AAD3CE
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0x06AB8AF2
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x67D4E2DC
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0x4A018D80
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x444176B3
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x4A6414F4
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x77613854
strength for anything.
0x9832C9FE

0xB04A0E33
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x77A359E4
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x08244A47
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0x0B327546

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXIV
0x9674748A

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x115245EB
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0x4E85061A
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x403D8844

0xB04A0E33
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x15B7E63E
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x0760B532
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x14F446E0
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xE598A726
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x8ED2A22A
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0xD9DFC7EA
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0xFD98B595
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0xD776EF3F
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xC752E1C6

0xB04A0E33
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x9272485A
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x2CB16210
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x9270FA3D
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0xB29537DA
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x40A3F922
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xDF891E83
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x46634657
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0xADAC57FE
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0xF3BA5C1D

0xB04A0E33
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0xF02904F1
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x9A8E1A7F
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0xDEC62F67
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x2DE1DE11
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0xF5E6CC2C
schoolroom.
0x37126F73

0xB04A0E33
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0xA5E97BFA

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x3D5435CA

0xB04A0E33
"Where is he?"
0x12BDD920

0xB04A0E33
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x56FAF814
there he stood.
0x5ED7B24D

0xB04A0E33
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xC9BEAD71
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x2ED97EE8
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0xCE9C8649
well loved, so caressed by him.
0xB70997F8

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0xF4ECE1FF
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x5C9F971D
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0xE3CABC5A
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0x189D01C5
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x1486B23E
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x396B8797

0xB04A0E33
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0xD28D0861

0xB04A0E33
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0xFA8E388D
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x9C61FEC8

0xB04A0E33
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x29B69EF9
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x7BCCA9D9
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0xFFB0DFE1
think almost fear.
0xD6C5CDDE

0xB04A0E33
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x50F2B9A0

0xB04A0E33
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x837D3551
strange."
0xCD09D481

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x40DED844
Rochester's girl-bride."
0x31D9AEAE

0xB04A0E33
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xA0664BBC
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0xB2973F0B
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x4E527A16
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x43B1AE89

0xB04A0E33
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0xD1624308
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0xBB6C938E
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0xD6321F92
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0xA681B06A
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0x6C0195BE

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x694F0B0E
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0xB41BC060
have them."
0xD5CE194D

0xB04A0E33
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0xD11C3074
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0x53D57D74
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0xDEFDDA1B
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0x026B83F0

0xB04A0E33
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x3D82CE1B
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0x606CDF0B
Quakerish governess."
0xBF429F1C

0xB04A0E33
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xBBA14A15
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x2BEE3439

0xB04A0E33
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x42248130
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0xFF4BE629

0xB04A0E33
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0x3AA245F0
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x557CD695
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0x41987792
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x513082F1
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0x7381DED0

0xB04A0E33
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x2C042F14
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0xD805620A
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0xE3CD3A01
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x2B79A356
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x708AA925
flatter me."
0x750E195B

0xB04A0E33
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x5EB7428A
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0x494B1FEE
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x0D0C4B61
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0xE3D75109
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0x2AE6CF67
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xFD2CCB3D
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x5524C37C
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0xDE7DFF7B
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0xC0816ABE

0xB04A0E33
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x0656A1EC

0xB04A0E33
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0xE9AA609D
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x822B8825
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0xAE41A9FB
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x12B8E2D6
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x6A607E6C
as my comforter."
0x8B20E089

0xB04A0E33
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0x99CDD8F6
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0x4AD611C1
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0xEC827269
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x9F17CC86
anticipate."
0x369525C3

0xB04A0E33
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x33D544B3

0xB04A0E33
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0xFFFA3B16
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x40EC7E35
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0xAEE72CA3
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0xA7A9318D
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x84CCE2D6
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x94A88F16
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0xCDDE7DB2
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0x7240FD4C
dear master."
0x584B3D3C

0xB04A0E33
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0xF2CB1968
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x690D9430
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0x69ED1186

0xB04A0E33
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0xD660F00C

0xB04A0E33
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x23E1BEA6
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0xA23FC9B2
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x80A1079A
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x43B003B5
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x1159ECBB
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x5A015D13

0xB04A0E33
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0x51A7CAB2
such an one?"
0x6EAD9A79

0xB04A0E33
"I love it now."
0x57A29D74

0xB04A0E33
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x66391F51
standard?"
0xAACC6905

0xB04A0E33
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0xAB7ECF0B
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0x2009F819
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x4E167B47
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x426F7084
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x2838ADBA
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x2A8C6753
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0x40F39BB9

0xB04A0E33
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0x924491D9
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0xEE99866E

0xB04A0E33
"You were, you little elfish--"
0x6E733664

0xB04A0E33
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0x62324866
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0x72B498B3
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x6AEB161F
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0xEE9E0D27
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0xDCDDF970
pleasure to grant."
0xDC4B623D

0xB04A0E33
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x87C7C3CD

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0x50981A3F

0xB04A0E33
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0xB5C06E0F
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0x68F55A95

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x008548DF
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x4CC9F3DC
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0xA74CBCE0

0xB04A0E33
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0x9C1F9287
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x892FED4C
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0xD6F3E21C
withdrawn: try again."
0xB0405207

0xB04A0E33
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x34E938DF
piqued on one point."
0x1F137178

0xB04A0E33
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x4C316D49
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0x1A6BDBFF
request--"
0x4164660A

0xB04A0E33
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0x8F51BE72

0xB04A0E33
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0x23AAC977
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0xA7D20B55

0xB04A0E33
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0x6C9EB704
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0xEE21FBB9
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0xFB9321C8
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0xCC1C09FB

0xB04A0E33
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0xE6DA9684
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0xA0899617
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x35C590C4

0xB04A0E33
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0x1DD0C43A
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0x34DE3258
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x60AAF437
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0xCE028E29
of my power?"
0x9D561F03

0xB04A0E33
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0x2FED475E
up."
0x821AD3C4

0xB04A0E33
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0x6FF3CCC3
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0x91F5E9EE
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0xEAB5EF59
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x13E7A2EB

0xB04A0E33
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0xA11B6ADF
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x820B87CD
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x2126BFEB

0xB04A0E33
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xC59F1513
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x742AA878
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xAA981AB5
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0xF304DC45

0xB04A0E33
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x342725BF
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x6B5EA44A
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0xEF315D90
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x7D275F7F
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0xBD28986F
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x20DD2210
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0xD1173E9E
made me the offer."
0x2B8B15D9

0xB04A0E33
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0xE2A0DEF4

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0xEA15AA14
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x12998413
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0xDE9BB368

0xB04A0E33
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x5073CB0F
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x04012F50
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x1E735369

0xB04A0E33
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xFDE52A94
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x19726618

0xB04A0E33
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x8F761D64
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x8EEA8D80
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0xDA5BE30E
deserted?"
0x76345223

0xB04A0E33
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0xA62F00ED
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0xED9A9300
moment."
0x2AEC9636

0xB04A0E33
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0xE173B7AA
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x1838E244

0xB04A0E33
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0x2F445758
awry for want of attention."
0xF5753770

0xB04A0E33
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x58D8A3E3
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x86AAE8BE
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x86971A8F

0xB04A0E33
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x6614BBB4
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x6C7DA599
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0xB5002D68

0xB04A0E33
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0xDE0DC375
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x887EE3B7
express.
0x196D5C84

0xB04A0E33
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x20DEBCA8
entreated, and to yield."
0xDF1D929D

0xB04A0E33
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0x65471A2D
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x2C92627C
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x4385E13F
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x61E4ACBE

0xB04A0E33
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x40ACE5FF
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0xE3FCBC35
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x5056A29C
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0xADCA9FD5

0xB04A0E33
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0xBB9E81F7

0xB04A0E33
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x661E7B55
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xDDDE6B68

0xB04A0E33
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x5F49CF85
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xBA52FEE3
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x101E2B91
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0xDC0EF135
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x49915DF8
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x03663068
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x83E976BD
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x225168AB
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x06361B2C
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0xBE0F9B65

0xB04A0E33
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0x777B456D
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x36D72403
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x4AAA19FA
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0xAA0524E5
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x8902D7F6
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xE619CE68
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xEAAFDEE1
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0xCA2635BA
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0xA5874AD1
you would be his wife."
0x60220506

0xB04A0E33
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x7E8F80AE

0xB04A0E33
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0xFE9AA18D

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x3FC09DC8
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0x53A9E1F1
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x2F4A8678

0xB04A0E33
"He tells me so."
0x02A925CC

0xB04A0E33
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0xDA77C409
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x17731642

0xB04A0E33
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x6D6AE7D8
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x4FA8306D
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x6C6EC778
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x06A8C302
father."
0x80FC734E

0xB04A0E33
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x5DD104D0
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x9ACEC5E4
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0xD03F5E6C
twenty."
0x91BE72BE

0xB04A0E33
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x605BE8AC

0xB04A0E33
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0xD1CAF60C
eyes.
0xFA96FCE0

0xB04A0E33
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x73E90EF7
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0xD91479E1
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0xDCF7CAC6
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0xD0B2BBF6
I expect."
0xA80E92C7

0xB04A0E33
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0x55D4EF7F
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0xC4120D17

0xB04A0E33
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x0AA32ADD
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x36E5B285
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xA0AFB010
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x2E7AA60E
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x92A42675
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0xA10F04DE
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0xC344E1FA
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0xA9FBA5B9
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x64B150FE
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0xAC1951AE
him."
0xBA1B2E91

0xB04A0E33
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x3E9EAF6E
that all was right."
0xBC0A0C0B

0xB04A0E33
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0x180DA620
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x536C410F
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0x20809CA6
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0x175FBDDC

0xB04A0E33
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0x4E42A7D3

0xB04A0E33
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x87FB40C8
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xCD61EE07
me go mademoiselle."
0xE046C807

0xB04A0E33
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x78CF3948
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x4FA929D7
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0xC7A1B36E
backwards and forwards.
0xBC8C6705

0xB04A0E33
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x686F4D5A

0xB04A0E33
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0xC2D0E8F9

0xB04A0E33
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x184A4340

0xB04A0E33
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x58BAFE6A

0xB04A0E33
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0xD71B9712
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x475F548C
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0xD6994D9E
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0xBED9AC3A
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x8095C058
my face.
0xE0A5B214

0xB04A0E33
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x73C4FB19
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xC897D265

0xB04A0E33
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x93650082

0xB04A0E33
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x59701F79
to Adele.
0xA4D550C3

0xB04A0E33
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x7EC15F1A

0xB04A0E33
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x8E0C581C
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x8018826F
company--for life."
0x3D3CB229

0xB04A0E33
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0x8D3780EF
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0xA4C2FD51
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x4A40E12A
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x665E301D
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x96AAF0F2

0xB04A0E33
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x3FE04DB0
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x9AFEBA41

0xB04A0E33
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0xB795063A
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xA3B09754

0xB04A0E33
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x84C8D3F2
mademoiselle?"
0x1D3100AA

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xD072EF3B
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x887920E0
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x6067D8B2
there, and only me."
0x3320BEE9

0xB04A0E33
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0x07D71DBD

0xB04A0E33
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x6A79471F
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x8B812C61

0xB04A0E33
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0x806CC826

0xB04A0E33
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x7E0FCE8B
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0x01D8AF0A

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x9A0ACB65
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0xCA0B65E9

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x7DACA12C
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x07EC0860
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x35656192
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0x69AAFAFE

0xB04A0E33
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xB0529DC2
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0xE14A8D0E
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x10894CCF

0xB04A0E33
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x22187CEB

0xB04A0E33
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0xC75928D4
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0xE883966E

0xB04A0E33
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0xD47A5E07
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xCCAED9BF
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0xBF85D313
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x04DAD43E

0xB04A0E33
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xEB9A50E7
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0x66AE0BC7
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x8806EDC3
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0xBF1E7B6C
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0x0F4FF9C8
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0xA2ED1C83
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0xD85EB59A
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0x9799BB0A
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x07A9E3E1
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0x19C34E49
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x81B8A73B
effect--
0xBC455264

0xB04A0E33
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0xF26EEC19
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0x71320915
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x06F5B031
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0xA965E1B7
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0xF3561BEC
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x632AE955

0xB04A0E33
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x7C94400F
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x3B01951A
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x50218470
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xC325D62D
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0xFD9AC5C0
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x3261E698
again."
0xDE4C4070

0xB04A0E33
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x5009C85E
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x05CA49EE

0xB04A0E33
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x88A1E9E8
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x455C3FF3
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x9862B5C4
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x869315A2
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0xB5E17691
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0xA2728521
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0xC5F78F6E

0xB04A0E33
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x239DDDD0
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x29A27BA0
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0xA686A0E6
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x16582E98
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x74844F9C
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0x163C2F12
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x3051777B
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0xE081DBD5
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x5D392FA0
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x23EDC96E
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0xB807D9AA
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x0FAD98C7
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x77DC6D85
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xBCEA51FE

0xB04A0E33
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xB4EB9DF4
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x9C1A3FDE
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0xF4427701
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xDAF56900
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xDAE00561
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0xDBBB38CC
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0xFBA21839
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0xEE1154FA
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0xBEDBFB03
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x28319AB9
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x49786363
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x24412C97
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0xB838924B
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0xFAB45F25
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0xE69DF7DC
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x5977C2BE
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x9FF447E9
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0xA602A9CC
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0xE28658BB
passionate pressure.
0xEDEBF739

0xB04A0E33
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x3FDB9539
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x98B217CF
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0xDC9EDC59
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x2E19DC9A
satin."
0x94C0F2A9

0xB04A0E33
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x406F04BD
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x7008A872
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x505C67C5
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0xE4BFE6C8

0xB04A0E33
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0x99922EA6
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0xA2F6BAE8
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x70045D47
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0xC525CC1E
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0xFD9124E8
satisfactorily here."
0x1A915BC3

0xB04A0E33
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0x3D542BC6
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x30BFDF1B

0xB04A0E33
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x71D4934D
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0xB58B8945
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0xC8F3D64B
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0xF7DE170C
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x8265A803
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x8FA18724

0xB04A0E33
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0x02AB8F64

0xB04A0E33
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0x9A0FBAF0
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x1134FBA1
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0xE06FC8D3
would be to violate its conditions."
0x2726A869

0xB04A0E33
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x9F2DF56D
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0x1BEB8B6A
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0xBA56B9A0

0xB04A0E33
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0xC110986E
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x4CFDA4E0
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0x0D6EAEC7
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0xD69415E7
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0x032A4A1C
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0xE145988E

0xB04A0E33
"Well, but what?"
0x507EE0C6

0xB04A0E33
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0x530FAD47

0xB04A0E33
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x52F73D96
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x58D4576C
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0x816CD3A5

0xB04A0E33
"No, thank you, sir."
0x0CC608FB

0xB04A0E33
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0xF0B6F8C8

0xB04A0E33
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0xBE2DD504
till--"
0x65315D61

0xB04A0E33
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0x1CA73683

0xB04A0E33
"Till I can't help it."
0x9E385F60

0xB04A0E33
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0xFF2AA151
companion of my repast?"
0xBB62A0A9

0xB04A0E33
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0x0CA3C146
usual for another month."
0xDB8ADDB7

0xB04A0E33
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0x47FB8D16

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0x3F1B2822
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x24B2D6E0
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0x9B53A51D
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0xC221A3DD

0xB04A0E33
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x27C491EC
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0x80167221
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0x1A3899A1
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0x730526FE
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0xD7EA9C65
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x7AF191DB
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0xD99F43F4
my jewel I should tyne."
0x3415F52F

0xB04A0E33
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x0FBF527F
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x24E086A1
retreat upstairs.
0xA34B2B15

0xB04A0E33
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x5627626D
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xDD32D7FB
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x44148677
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x1895B69A
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x5DD7685D
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0xEB0D353E
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0x01B168C1
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0xE6DE9142
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x5D474CCB
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x0A32D796
the present.
0xBB770CCD

0xB04A0E33
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x722A9A5E

0xB04A0E33
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x6976FFE1
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0x68D9B94C
stimulate it.
0x9A5EAC70

0xB04A0E33
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x5BD94158

0xB04A0E33
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0xA569F55F

0xB04A0E33
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x0CAEAFDF
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0x6E3FF3E7
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x73F9552B
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0xC06F456C
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x35A92B56
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x1309766D
strain:--
0xE5205C98

0xB04A0E33
   "The truest love that ever heart
0x9BA90174
      Felt at its kindled core,
0xF782CBD4
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0x1506860B
      The tide of being pour.
0x025777F3

0xB04A0E33
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x51589909
      Her parting was my pain;
0xF2DECC0D
   The chance that did her steps delay
0xA7D9169A
      Was ice in every vein.
0xA165FA9C

0xB04A0E33
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0xF75BB552
      As I loved, loved to be;
0xE3086EEA
   And to this object did I press
0xC4B57DA2
      As blind as eagerly.
0xD4F68D5A

0xB04A0E33
   But wide as pathless was the space
0xA4D8133D
      That lay our lives between,
0xB3EE9236
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0xA258F652
      Of ocean-surges green.
0xA8EDA0FB

0xB04A0E33
   And haunted as a robber-path
0x0E438378
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x20F1A3C2
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x1FD3E3B2
      Between our spirits stood.
0xEADD06B8

0xB04A0E33
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x5E29BECA
      I omens did defy:
0xF3E706CA
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x5C6D7265
      I passed impetuous by.
0x1039F36F

0xB04A0E33
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0xEFBEA939
      I flew as in a dream;
0x409C181B
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0xBF99BD8C
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x927FDD53

0xB04A0E33
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xAF43D912
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0xBD8B877C
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xA93BB628
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x9DE24D95

0xB04A0E33
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x19B1F185
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0xD59C7F7A
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0x7F022F19
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0x5D7E0D3B

0xB04A0E33
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x18AADDEA
      Right, bar approach to me,
0xC219AC9D
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x22B8E767
      Swear endless enmity.
0xB5EBC249

0xB04A0E33
   My love has placed her little hand
0x82F812DB
      With noble faith in mine,
0xE6F08D58
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x06E7EB8F
      Our nature shall entwine.
0x0EDEDA62

0xB04A0E33
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x63239F5B
      With me to live--to die;
0x0CE63DDD
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xDF913643
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x1BC7E78F

0xB04A0E33
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0x22678231
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x7AFF6F11
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0xDF6D2061
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x639657C2
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x1162BE44
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0x64A9886B

0xB04A0E33
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x107E75F4

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0xE0AA7011
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0x2F4CBF2D
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0xE8213374

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0xE7B5FEFE
Death was not for such as I."
0xDC5738E7

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x6DF41A34
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x00671F76

0xB04A0E33
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0x1542C02E
reconciling kiss?"
0xFF2F49E6

0xB04A0E33
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x5F1B80CF

0xB04A0E33
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x24F4FF23
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0xD19665D7
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0xB308AE17

0xB04A0E33
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x402BA2F5
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x9DA99A37
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x05DE33CD
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0xEED1CB28
time to rescind it.
0x19198869

0xB04A0E33
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x6E547908

0xB04A0E33
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x4084AA24
myself I was doing that now."
0x5034FE79

0xB04A0E33
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x62AFA3FE
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0xD43E31B8
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0xCEA8F5FD
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xE51FD1CA
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x8C0BF316
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x97068EAD
advantage."
0x18692102

0xB04A0E33
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xB6F8151D
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0xC0DBEE32
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x51272646
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x4A0EA808

0xB04A0E33
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0x1B23867E
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xEDBE2813
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x1990B9AA
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x78C93ADF
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x0B27C725
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0xABF8588E

0xB04A0E33
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xC211782C
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x0CA1DDDA
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0xFA1C1D07
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0xB4B04A4C
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x61179D81
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x556B6321
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x4D19AB39
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0x89BB376B
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x2D76CDD2
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xF765A258
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0xD595250C
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0xCE55A132
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x7B61CCE0
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0xA2A64429
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0xD6DF2FF1
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0xE434DFA2
virtue, another must be devised."
0x374AE126

0xB04A0E33
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xFB15F116
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0xB5CB3322
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0x9F24E534
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x9BC57B16
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x5D3A404A
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0xE1B655AB

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x5116CF25
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x9C68E4CC
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x914D0DC5
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x6BFA893E
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xD96ABF23
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x73477DE3
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0xEE7B4F0A
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x9DBFA3DE
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0xFA2777C1
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0xEE5E43C7
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x69FAC0A4
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x0C357FE6
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x87E2D6D3
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x09D79FF7
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x54BF51E8
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xA10344E3
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x92144CC7
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0xF8137396
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0xBE0D3DCC
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x8D5D81FC
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0xE4E042C9
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0xD581B82B
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x4E48AEBE

0xB04A0E33
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0xB88BD27D
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x56A27964
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x1257F65F
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x99412E18
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x4C7CBB27
more than they.
0xA37BB9F9

0xB04A0E33
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0xE38C704F
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x641710D3
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0xB06AEC1F
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0x1EA8EC0A
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0x91BD4D6D
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x96D0CDCE
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x889BF268
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x3E48F414
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0xDB6964A6
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0xF171CEAF

0xB04A0E33
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xB5CDFB01
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x638796DB
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x27B3C95C
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x3831F4C0
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xE8FA49A4
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x1D2E6F6E
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x3ED957A1
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x543FD597

0xB04A0E33
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x89E64370
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x0E68972F
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0xC91898DA
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x1B7EE473
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0xEFF61000
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xC37EB997
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x2523FC69
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x6E1FA41E
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x429E2566
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0xEA38ED44

0xB04A0E33
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x1DD52E4C
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0xBA58D7D8
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x1BB1FDCD
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x541AC12E
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0xC89AE510
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x21062157
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x175BB131
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x75615BD6
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0x81E74AAB
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0x401AC07E
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0xD601FE28
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x79363155
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x1DF0DA05
listen to, and I ran off again.
0x2C6FAA3C

0xB04A0E33
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x7CB0FAE0
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x4812CA91
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x989405A6
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0xDDB4E260
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0x5454896A
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0x67EB49C6
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x3F0FE2CC
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0xD3A48ED8
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0xAA1137DC
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0xADA00EC7
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0x16AFF554
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x43D9F48C
simultaneously struck ten.
0x00D1512A

0xB04A0E33
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x8BC82E26
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x4E270F06
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0xB61BE5C2

0xB04A0E33
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0x820496CE
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xB2AD85A6
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0x43EE77CA
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0x47F2B836
by one moving speck.
0xFD21C5BB

0xB04A0E33
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0xB2748ED2
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xCE7B81A2
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x7D0EC0EE
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x0A671243

0xB04A0E33
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x42A26DEC
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0xC08B72E8
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x0B397C4A
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0xA78E0A7D
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x13B9EBE5
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0xB5605F0C
meridian, and must now decline.
0x4F54D472

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x6EB8FED1
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0xD0924AE4
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0x59B0D1F2

0xB04A0E33
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0xDBD72553
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0x4AA84B3A
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0x380894CF
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x4DFCAB66
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x58F01F41
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0xCE3A6F4F

0xB04A0E33
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xB1A6B2D8
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0xFC0B2DE9
give me both hands: mount!"
0x1D61346B

0xB04A0E33
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x0BF84212
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x18210AEB
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x8C30D12F
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x869D9500
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0xF52958F3

0xB04A0E33
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xFEDC4823
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x331E64EA

0xB04A0E33
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0xD39CA671
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0xDD460431
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x184C5C1A

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xA66C7510

0xB04A0E33
"Then you have been both?"
0xAC9305F0

0xB04A0E33
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x4D7FBFAD
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x52099A93

0xB04A0E33
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x258CBB40
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0xE647C0F6
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0xD98756ED
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0x7484E7B8
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0x115F0106
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x14F4D529

0xB04A0E33
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0x8252135F
get down."
0x272A0182

0xB04A0E33
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0xDE13E13C
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0xBB33F64E
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0x3E7D3A22
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x237FF5FD
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0xF7377C84

0xB04A0E33
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x3CCAFDAB
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0xDB10C1E1

0xB04A0E33
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xA68B1632
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0x2325587A
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xF455E6C5

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0xF4260556
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0xAA975177

0xB04A0E33
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x34C31F4D

0xB04A0E33
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x2C93B76A

0xB04A0E33
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0xDCDBD780
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x42E0A595
as a long, strong arm.
0x23798A23

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xD448E4D0
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0xD259F66B

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Jane."
0x589C5F98

0xB04A0E33
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x5B37AF99
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0xFE8642DB

0xB04A0E33
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x4443073D

0xB04A0E33
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0xDC2B8150
my wedding."
0x5CDC20E5

0xB04A0E33
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0x3A046255
no wish to go to bed."
0x815237B0

0xB04A0E33
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x0B613BC1

0xB04A0E33
"All, sir."
0xAEB0224E

0xB04A0E33
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0x6591696A
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x5E01048D
from church."
0x31D7396D

0xB04A0E33
"Very well, sir."
0x104C0DA5

0xB04A0E33
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xD4EF2384
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x860C78C0
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0x8A3D3145

0xB04A0E33
"I believe I am."
0xAE660FBC

0xB04A0E33
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x3728ABB6

0xB04A0E33
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xDD326793
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xD57B21DE
charged?"
0xCC8A4DCA

0xB04A0E33
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0xEDFD95A0
over-fatigued."
0xD6D410A2

0xB04A0E33
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0x80EA2F7B

0xB04A0E33
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0xC0C7A535

0xB04A0E33
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0x388EAA33
and flushed.
0x95137B6D

0xB04A0E33
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0x86617979
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xD79EE41C
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x2B31CDA3

0xB04A0E33
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x96E2E000

0xB04A0E33
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0xAF37E121
new life into which you are passing?"
0x3B053F45

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0xFE4483C1
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x9A789E5F

0xB04A0E33
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0xD6CB71EE

0xB04A0E33
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0x5E10C0A5
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0x253C9D4B
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0xE9F95664
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0x1D752A79
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0xD917EFC4

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x8AE816C1
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0x42BA3FA6
proceeded.
0x59F236A1

0xB04A0E33
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0x4B4B0585
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x4E01C104
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x8F90C313
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xF9693E4A
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x7108A7EB
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x01F122C8
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0xF08B70C1
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x8798BE39
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0x49A75CAF
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x075CD32E
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0xBB85CCF0
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0xA5D07EF6
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0xE31AA9AB
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xD65AC3F0
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x283286E2
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x7284B168
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0xAE0445AA
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0xAC4A2124
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x883A2CD0
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x195AF895
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0xD065B067
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0x130BB19E
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0xF252D096
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0x01D49A94
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x5D0504A4
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0xA189B251
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x3FC427CB
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0xD865C43B
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x1D7A7CE9
coronet."
0x03B6DD6E

0xB04A0E33
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xEE11A38F
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x8B039F2A
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x79DA8823

0xB04A0E33
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x86C8CB12
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x742A78A9
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0xABE349DC
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x3BF751B6
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x6AF0E0B1
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x5958650B
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0xAEA4E37F
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0xD8A44690
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x169E9618
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xC1A6D487
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x080A0DC1
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0x192376E2
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x092A6C7D
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x87AA6451
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0xEE8DAE97
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0x38786B71
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x43B561E8
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x17A0F456
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x6D6BB914
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0x63284D6E
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x2E9BF538
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x75FB1F42
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x964AFB9F
moment."
0x2AEC9636

0xB04A0E33
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0x80CA14C5
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x36F79322
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0x75C94ECC
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0x8CC34009
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xAC8D0C96
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0xA66F800D
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0xF84952D4
Jane?--repeat it."
0x878AAB32

0xB04A0E33
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0x07AC078C

0xB04A0E33
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0xC68C68A7
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x0F03540C
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0x67DB36E5
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x81710B4E
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x5FE08CC6
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x11E59BED
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0xAED7BD23
incensed than saddened."
0x81865804

0xB04A0E33
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xC6A31D8A
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0x3DD2C092

0xB04A0E33
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0xBA273D34
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x12CB7FD5

0xB04A0E33
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0xE492B1B7
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0xDC86E432

0xB04A0E33
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x6C63130A
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x8FC52808

0xB04A0E33
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0xE7E02B32
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0xDAE0F314
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0xB40658A1
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x297C7151
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x7B55A850
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0xC4D1B41C
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0xA7EB77F8
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x5937E4F4
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0xDBA83AA9
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xA8EABAAC
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0xA878C352
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x7515079E
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x19DC1EF3
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0xF4654835
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0xD62EA437
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x48F6DDFD
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0xC855895C
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0xC1077C00
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0xF65F3ABC
woke."
0x4CCBC65C

0xB04A0E33
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x497CEA2C

0xB04A0E33
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x1D14284C
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xE84B9249
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0xCE689682
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x7CEFCD6C
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0xD6F0DF3A
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x8D6E7DBB
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0xDAAD07B4
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x2EEADA05
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x6B7CC59E
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x883D70BF
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x15CF2160
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x7476DB31
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0xAC6E5DE8

0xB04A0E33
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0x95A9B997

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0xA17C2039
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0xDE30A788
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0x832CF76D

0xB04A0E33
"Describe it, Jane."
0xC6556457

0xB04A0E33
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0xF4F69FF6
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x6C439B5B
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x47EC1B99

0xB04A0E33
"Did you see her face?"
0x83ACD0B9

0xB04A0E33
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x08FB4FC0
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xD11AB151
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x5337FAA4
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0x953CD93E

0xB04A0E33
"And how were they?"
0x368B7FA2

0xB04A0E33
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0x24990D1C
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x99AF56E9
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0xC4C2A617

0xB04A0E33
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0x6E58F8FB

0xB04A0E33
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x4AE2FEED
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0xF23503CB
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0x468662F3

0xB04A0E33
"You may."
0x1793F79D

0xB04A0E33
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0x312AAB72

0xB04A0E33
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0x1346DE2F

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x085E2425
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0xE27E64A1

0xB04A0E33
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x02C53A41
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0xF6A9AE26

0xB04A0E33
"Afterwards?"
0x939506C8

0xB04A0E33
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0xCB7CF18C
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x72F2BEFC
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0x19FF11A6
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x07823C1C
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xCA329B66
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x3E7A8F4C
from terror."
0xB3125EE6

0xB04A0E33
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0x34F2420D

0xB04A0E33
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0xF4CC3381
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0xC68ACC54
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0x370A01D6
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0xD23762B2

0xB04A0E33
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x33280265
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x736A35A4
handling."
0x6043AFBF

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0x777F7B88
transaction actually took place."
0x9D090B16

0xB04A0E33
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0xFB411D2F
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x22884C06
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x6CE69A24

0xB04A0E33
"Not yet."
0xA9B532CC

0xB04A0E33
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0x9F487B26
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xC230FF98
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x83563A41

0xB04A0E33
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x45E7092A
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0xB7A646C7
mystery of that awful visitant."
0xB320EA87

0xB04A0E33
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0xF0EA9010

0xB04A0E33
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0x4ADA983A
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0xC76B44DC
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x687FD98A
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0xDC56CF4C
to bottom in two halves!"
0xAC77B5B7

0xB04A0E33
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0x2655BCAA
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x5788DACC
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0xC9CCF12E
might have happened!"
0x5781577D

0xB04A0E33
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0x5F09F302
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x4C747144

0xB04A0E33
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x35D96630
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0xC8294AAA
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0x703D2E33
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0x082591A1
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x3971165C
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0xCAEF06A2
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x9415E5DD
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0xDF2A919D
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0x589248CF
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x7058D707
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0xE0E339F3
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0xAB79E1F6
solution of the mystery?"
0xC790B0DF

0xB04A0E33
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xB600A32C
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x6D3F7601
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0x8290BF38
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x47E8CB44

0xB04A0E33
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x5860465F
candle.
0xB2254B43

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x5E9883B4
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xE3E8AEA1
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x6E92C7A9
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0x054ECD2B

0xB04A0E33
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0xCD39533B

0xB04A0E33
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x6CA868F6
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0xCEB8EA99
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xCDEDB1DE
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0xA79DA4FD
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0xF07249D8
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x07BDD232
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0xE1E79ED3

0xB04A0E33
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x502594C3
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x86C5C9D7
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0x88786CC8

0xB04A0E33
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x61F67160
Janet now?"
0x075D6D0F

0xB04A0E33
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x832EE2EC

0xB04A0E33
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xFAC7682A
love and blissful union."
0x46A5D409

0xB04A0E33
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0x30263CB9
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xAE3DB4F8
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0xABBB4A76
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x29DC6267
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x6973B7B9
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0x60F665D2
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x875D8AFE
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x259C8D71
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x76D9F8F9
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0x9FD1DEB1
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0x7C8323F2

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xCD5A4B40
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0xEF0578C1
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0xB8CF9AE3
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x876925C8
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x76909D7A

0xB04A0E33
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0xB2DE8487
not taken one peep."
0xB2773F67

0xB04A0E33
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x5E2A19E6
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0xB133526A
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0xC48EEFF7
by Mr. Rochester.
0x6F7F5A6B

0xB04A0E33
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0xB40D758D
so long!"
0xA0E86BDC

0xB04A0E33
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x35BBA576
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0xE16C9E1A
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x7B18D468
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x316158FD
footman, answered it.
0xEF1464E6

0xB04A0E33
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xC845B32D

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0x18F13F5B

0xB04A0E33
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x3C7112B5

0xB04A0E33
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0xAED083D8
there: return and tell me."
0x33906596

0xB04A0E33
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xA888A8F5
footman soon returned.
0xC0ABC064

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0xB6779819

0xB04A0E33
"And the carriage?"
0xA6437F09

0xB04A0E33
"The horses are harnessing."
0x76528FB4

0xB04A0E33
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0x7F66CEFE
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0xBC9AA402
coachman in his seat."
0x706AEF85

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x96015E6C

0xB04A0E33
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0xBEF96BF8
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0xE26CD798
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x96CEEB1C
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x1B4181C7
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0xF033A9C6
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xF2162F0B
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x694386D1
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x558C0CB8
and flashing eyes.
0x2C2ECFB5

0xB04A0E33
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0xB03698A8
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xC91C2E30
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0xAC76F9B9
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x16367937
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0xB67A9695
seemed breasting and resisting.
0xAB45E5E6

0xB04A0E33
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x26A214C3
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0xA31240A6
me, Jane."
0xBC4072AA

0xB04A0E33
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xBF025C63
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x965B8E78
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0xE6A420FF
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x8E638191
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x077D284B
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0x12219616
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x3C4316E1
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x45CE3C08
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x6DE75D71
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0xB56C2FF8
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x3F57CCA7
path to the porch.
0xBB4BFDFF

0xB04A0E33
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x3C251CC2
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x0F781720
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0xC444E7E3
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x25DA915B
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x0BA364EC
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x20F59115
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0xCC06746F
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x4F603EBB

0xB04A0E33
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x941A5BA8
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0xEFEF6F17
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0x77BFA9EC
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x7FA51059
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x2E6475BE
Rochester, went on.
0x1B944892

0xB04A0E33
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x2A006CCD
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0xD0937CE7
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x2DCBCF66
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0x203212BC
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x8460121F
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x1F113795

0xB04A0E33
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0x8C9F9EA9
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x6F50AEC0
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x903BB3AE
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0xCD0DB53D
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0x28B656A3
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x293C81C4

0xB04A0E33
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xD12AFE18

0xB04A0E33
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0x900D198C
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x80F8C375
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x8035D2A7
said, "Proceed."
0xB2C6C1E2

0xB04A0E33
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0xFC53E0DD
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xE8036D6A

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0xA3390DC5
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0xB60FEE8F

0xB04A0E33
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x4CCE4915
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x46A67B7E
marriage exists."
0xF8587C88

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x9941E8B2
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0xA9A4A721
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x514B0C5D
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x9F2379A6
beneath!
0x320937AA

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x834E530C
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x14E93454

0xB04A0E33
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x6A45B5CB
advisedly."
0xD82AA6E4

0xB04A0E33
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x051FC2F7
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x53CF56A6

0xB04A0E33
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0x4BCF35A3
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x010ABB80

0xB04A0E33
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xB8BC6ABC
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xE375E905
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0x9D7BCD1B
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x84A3AA05
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0xC93BC519
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0x88BAD2A3
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x078AD9FC
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0xF2BC412F

0xB04A0E33
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xEE1DE0AA

0xB04A0E33
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x8F3973E3

0xB04A0E33
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0xDD5D63B4

0xB04A0E33
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0xE427A69E
recognises, if you do not."
0x53079082

0xB04A0E33
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x0D79019D
place of abode."
0xC694DBFB

0xB04A0E33
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xA6A1585E
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x7BD6AA48

0xB04A0E33
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0x45D5AE47
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0x307F42F2
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0xF391F46B
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0xA9E2728D
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0xE3BB13C8
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0x692C349D
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0x27173113
Mason.'"
0x02C8C616

0xB04A0E33
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x69A6F007
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x357944CF

0xB04A0E33
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x1E77936A

0xB04A0E33
"How do you know?"
0xFF6442B9

0xB04A0E33
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x4F925704
scarcely controvert."
0xA11FC6AB

0xB04A0E33
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x840BC2C4

0xB04A0E33
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x5F5F5522
goodness to step forward."
0x9AB2C10D

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x3FE05A7C
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xD2D0DB1F
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0xB419C3C3
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x7D9D718C
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x7BEA8057
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0x98D34602
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0xCD72E119
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x9D25BF36
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x74F11D65
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x6808AB2D
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0xEB10A8C9
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x41A9B19D
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x4B10D1DE
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0x00D85596

0xB04A0E33
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0x462563CE

0xB04A0E33
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0xEEC984F4
what have you to say?"
0x5FCB049F

0xB04A0E33
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0xC6A2F543
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0xCDF84439
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x80CC1E7D

0xB04A0E33
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0xAC1E4DEE

0xB04A0E33
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0xD835316C
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x40B0AA4F

0xB04A0E33
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x13B32747
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0xC0CAC72E
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x52B5D54B

0xB04A0E33
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x8BCFB5C4

0xB04A0E33
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x28CD6138
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x8805B30F
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x30A1CA91

0xB04A0E33
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xF0566076
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0x82BBB3F6
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x03F5BD24
obeyed.
0x91E504E6

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x4372A12F
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x2FCE2692
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x42ED07D2
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x47159DF9
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xF210A8D7
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0xE49EDDEA
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x7D8278AD
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0x45B78800
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0xDD5B548B
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x877492A0
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x1E5E6AFD
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xA84176D3
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x3A09C808
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x663D6A4E
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x6FD1A739
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x4BF17BB2
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x9E311170
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x4C97A7D6
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0xAD7D66E7
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x19814758
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0xD685C097
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0xF8A8319F
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x2F9AB1AB
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x3D7CD7C7
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x5B5E2941
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0x16FA3CEB
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x8A69A48E
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x7F399989
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x7F7A81D1
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x6FD37132
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x057A93C2
you--follow!"
0xF31B677E

0xB04A0E33
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0xDE761315
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0xAB9AD223

0xB04A0E33
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0xD181B104
will not be wanted to-day."
0x28CB7645

0xB04A0E33
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0x1E6A3529
greet us.
0x7D1664B1

0xB04A0E33
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0xF9564472
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0x38CB04A2
late!"
0x51596AB3

0xB04A0E33
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x360F55D3
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x84C89F74
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x8404E159
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xBD2ADA7C
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0x0D743507

0xB04A0E33
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xF3D01134
here."
0x96D2795E

0xB04A0E33
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x567671D2
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0x7C945122
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x53C1F134
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x6564C63B
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x6487740F
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0xCB319B2E
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x64E3D336
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xF2EB64B0
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0xA2680397
mane, hid its head and face.
0x8A572CB0

0xB04A0E33
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x5BD80751
your charge to-day?"
0xCF60F56B

0xB04A0E33
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x11AD6971
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."

0xB04A0E33
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x732C30B0
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x021FB7A8

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x5F9BEAC0

0xB04A0E33
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x90A209EA

0xB04A0E33
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x3C75EEF9

0xB04A0E33
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0xE5609AAA
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x2DF3756A
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0xB4C762D6

0xB04A0E33
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xD937427F
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0xFDBDEF84

0xB04A0E33
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0xD6D1B701
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x651B8EE0

0xB04A0E33
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x3CA76651

0xB04A0E33
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x25DFE363

0xB04A0E33
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x62741201
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x47CE5780
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xE7EB37B8
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0xBFF91553
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x67D4F89B
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xAB07EE81
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x833B5464
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x2B80A0D2
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x7728E870
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x6203F2C1
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0xBA31D8AB
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x76E598D1

0xB04A0E33
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0xE11BCD40
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0x442A55C6
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0xF05DEE66
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x49D41D92
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x2F9A601F
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0x2190FA78
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0xA0237A10
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x0C7CE0CF
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x07492E43
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0xD324B9A1

0xB04A0E33
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xC94FE3D0
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0x75DDBFD9
the stair.
0xC7AB51E6

0xB04A0E33
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x02F74C62
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x3795D713
returns to Madeira."
0x2322EB8B

0xB04A0E33
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0xBB30723D

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0x959CCD73
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xBB015A66
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x140C740F
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0xBDA03276
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0xBC6188F8
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0xFD9C39F9
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x85445243
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x8AA295FA
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x4AF9A399
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xCA67EFEE
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0xA2120D64
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0xBD14E3B0
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x55D95A8C
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x3D83A78D
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x3C25A545
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0xB346C298
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x0135817F
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0xA6F1BBE9
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0x69CB15E5

0xB04A0E33
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0x0EF9E377
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0x52037BEE
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xAE399596
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x1DBCF7F3

0xB04A0E33
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x7A7F5453
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x34E7B4BE
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x67137FBB
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xB96D89F1
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x4424CC70
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x61FF8D6F
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x41863C98
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x1C6509F5
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0x21D1D2C7
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0xD96419E7

0xB04A0E33
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x767B8316
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x3472B0C6
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0x71654AE7
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x7786AF4E
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x2623B199
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xC8ECAC3A
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0xBF7A781C
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0x157C8127

0xB04A0E33
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x23D92D02
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x29ED9A01
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0x6EE9850D
prospects?
0xFAA3B1C4

0xB04A0E33
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x5C142303
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0xA5A6E352
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x80649AF4
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x8F965D52
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x86DD5F63
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x0D5B2CB4
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xAB855251
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0xAAE007B2
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xD6A28B9E
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x8409FA68
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x0D092E30
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x2C9C3E0A
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xCCF8E229
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x281D76F6
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x260C1926
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0xBD3C2D01
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x47F37C47
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x47C8CAE8
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x6708EEBB
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x1F0B72FF
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0xD8B27B91
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x6BD29334
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0xE92BD10D
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0x36253FEA
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x240BE1B3
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0xF1A02467
conduct!
0x5F7EB701

0xB04A0E33
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0xDE42B382
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x0D93475A
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0xBBE49069
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x41F0DE6A
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x428F40FC
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0x397EC7D7
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x75ED48D6
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0xBD53BECA
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x25F9E4B6

0xB04A0E33
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x81A26C08

0xB04A0E33
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0xC97B5ED8
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x4A065ADB
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0xB3CCFD36
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x0EB22F72
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x9FEB9876
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0xA168962D
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0x5C11A21A
floods overflowed me."
0x1C42E1A0

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXVII
0x1ECE1BB8

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x372181E3
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x19A49736
"What am I to do?"
0x1E37BC54

0xB04A0E33
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0x62BB15BC
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x24B51807
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0xDF16FDA4
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x76F1B915
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0xFDE7D8A2
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0xB1B64289
cannot do it."
0x12F319F4

0xB04A0E33
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0xE404B666
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0xE80D8571
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xB1978C88
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x475F4E1C
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x513C8875
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0xCC0948F9
depths of agony.
0xC1267D0C

0xB04A0E33
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x8DA18E48

0xB04A0E33
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x5BCDEF33
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x62BBC01E
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x94A883A5

0xB04A0E33
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x16701544
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x146B5D60
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0x7320FD49
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0xA5A41CEB
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x0F31D324
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0xF2DAFF83
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x2B46E5EA
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0xFBD6D356
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x1073AD91
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x701C60E5
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x3549FD3F
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xDAE83745
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0x826E5571
threshold.
0x7F24E718

0xB04A0E33
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x7FC97E04
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xAA4A95C3
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x500DBB71
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xA97DF3F7
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x36602691
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0xB0AE6748
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0xBA1AF82B
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0xAF57CE02
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x831F0688
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x2FBF91E9

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x615ACD5A
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x6DF00872
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x29AE414C

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x57E7B721
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x2A770BA2
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0xD2CD1A18
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0x14521260
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x18B0D6EB

0xB04A0E33
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0xC90D1563
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x5FEA82AC
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x4D02F54A
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0x5C37DA39
heart's core.
0xD96ADACA

0xB04A0E33
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x72D5A16B
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x38AA202D
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0x619FA9CD

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0x2C48E252

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0x48A5DAB1
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x5DA321BF
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x999013A6
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x361D3D9B
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x6E94B600
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x4D315685
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x640C0AA8
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x5F0449FB
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x5AF695D5
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x47D69720
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x327B9E24
him."
0xBA1B2E91

0xB04A0E33
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x63D8E868

0xB04A0E33
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0xD4D11459

0xB04A0E33
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0xD4D03ECB

0xB04A0E33
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x5CEEBC9B
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0x31AE3885
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0xB976F508
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x30A9353B
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0x434D8768
put his aside.
0xE812A42E

0xB04A0E33
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x123606C6
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x39CB5BF1
appropriated?"
0x8857ABCA

0xB04A0E33
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0xCA28BFBD

0xB04A0E33
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0xC80F950F
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x53A89E39
rightly?"
0xB7C37383

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x0EC6B73E
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x67FC8A82
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xFD72B64B
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0xD1FA9E32
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x1FE1B41A
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x143364FD
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x189D6D2A
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0xF3D77F0A
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x6B2D5C30
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x44407E1F
know you--I am on my guard."
0xF7113A26

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x7D92F706
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0xD214F7DC

0xB04A0E33
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x1E5B12C6
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0x209995CA
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0xA7F9171C
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x3BBEFFC3
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x25789A66
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0xB80F4A35
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x4327BD9E
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x444C009B

0xB04A0E33
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x461BF8C5
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x69A481B5
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0xCDB2203F
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x045307DB

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x136671B1
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x6B3615CC
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x6E99BAA6
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0x95C5B2C6
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xE944C59D
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0x38AE49DA
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x91654F3F
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0xA20D43C5
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0x018CF55B
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0x2BB63D63
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0x35E8526A
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0xB52B4B87
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0xF36AE061
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x04751BA6
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0xA32CECD7
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0x56F8807A
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x2D143F5F
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0x48B60350

0xB04A0E33
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0x12600774
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0xAA7CDC07
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0xAA01E7FF
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0x4B07388A
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0xB3B563C2
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x0D241CCF
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x639603D3
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0xF47F5061
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x5C4A5B21
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x50E0C24A

0xB04A0E33
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xA23267A3
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0x6BD751A7
cannot help being mad."
0x7908852C

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x04DC9951
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x1A7C26C9
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x5E4FAAFA

0xB04A0E33
"I do indeed, sir."
0xC48DE40D

0xB04A0E33
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0x57626EA3
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x0975C1FE
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x7F5CAAAC
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x904CB73B
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0x2DCEDE2D
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x29220AE3
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xA4D97D88
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0x8F9D19CB
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x2AB0AA05
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x5F0E213C
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x128A8F9E
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0xEE8A4431
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0xB3B37499
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0xC6D33ABB
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x60EB5D03
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0xBF8D2347
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x0AB59EEA
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x63DA7237
falsehood and slander."
0x7F02B719

0xB04A0E33
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0x4BDF94BB
for you."
0xC5AE97DB

0xB04A0E33
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x265730FD
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x72687178
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0x99AD5C34
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0x76AEA2F3

0xB04A0E33
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x5C986839
too dull for you."
0x30073B32

0xB04A0E33
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0xBBB5D8CA
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x9A8E1385
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0x1CF6C2CC

0xB04A0E33
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x91CC468E
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0x29BF4E0F
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xEFE54A9E
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x90DACD5F
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0x0C7992F3

0xB04A0E33
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0x529EDD68
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0xBD97CDD3
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x88638A96
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0x7766C810
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x58A6FD16
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xAFC1D10C

0xB04A0E33
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0xF1CDFBD1
before me.
0x31099556

0xB04A0E33
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0x4DF062CC
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0xCC1300EF
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x7ADB1011
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x702DC4A2
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0x59C1EF45
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0x18C619EA
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0x52C67686
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x55C39899
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xF535231A
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0xA7225DF6
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0xC925A28D
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0xB36B79D2
soothingly--
0xB93D8A86

0xB04A0E33
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x7D5096DA
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x2A0CCD9A

0xB04A0E33
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x1EEADEE3
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x440B15F7
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0xF0902DAD
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x1BF7E731
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x3B808C01
heartily.
0x832B4C34

0xB04A0E33
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x5EDAC3C4
not while he was in such a passion.
0xAC9A26C3

0xB04A0E33
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x81F52977
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x5878BABF
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x901C7D62

0xB04A0E33
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0xDCD89CA3
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xBCCE21B8
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x4ADA95C7

0xB04A0E33
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xCE47945E
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x9324A71C
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0xC6136133
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x619C8FA6
were some toad or ape."
0x2437AB5D

0xB04A0E33
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0xAB3B4739
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x2B1F91E6
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0xCF50C028
where I had wounded.
0xAE4A510B

0xB04A0E33
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x9636AAE3
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x27DF89BA

0xB04A0E33
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0x37493E93
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0x048E81DE

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0xCCE042C9
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0x1E930828

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x339D39E6

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0xA2D16F56

0xB04A0E33
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0xA59C348D
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x96FAE42E

0xB04A0E33
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0xD9B8781E
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x461CF148
scenes."
0x0482788C

0xB04A0E33
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x6D5F6778
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x06C9C086
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0x62EA9B2D
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0x92E89BF0
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x8E3FD1A8
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0x0655D096
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0x3292305B
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x3F908810
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x92E9226F
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x7CDCD684

0xB04A0E33
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0xBA656202
still I dared to speak.
0xE08DF863

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x33889485
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0x0321FEA9
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x184E7D8D

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x40FB1619
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0x31C77F62
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0x109D20AF

0xB04A0E33
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0x0EDDF796
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0xB8E6FAE2
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0xFFB06983
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x4BBAB95A
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x4F30B945
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0x2C81D3C4

0xB04A0E33
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0xA1C8C5F2
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0xB3051283
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0xBE2B216A
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x90AEE435
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0xE0554BD2
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0xA2F99CE3
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0x03702D7D
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0xEB84CB44

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xDA49081F

0xB04A0E33
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0xD591B8BF
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0x1A43D57F

0xB04A0E33
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0x3C719EC0

0xB04A0E33
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0xBF4268F8

0xB04A0E33
"I have understood something to that effect."
0x7FD4991D

0xB04A0E33
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0xB9BF24EA
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0x196A2E37
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x9F408E8B
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0xC9ED7274
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x9EFC45AC
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0xE8EC39F9
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x46877D28
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x766D1BCA
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x874AEB3D
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0x0DCA913C
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x50AFC38B
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0x64109A34
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x4B31611B
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0xA1EDA548
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x2E91022D
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0x6D253B1C
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x5934D992
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xBE9B085F
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0xD27385DF
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0xACA6B62B
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x96C761DA
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x0418EBDD
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0x2386F691
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0xB82C261B
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0xD1D2ECE9
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x37A1BCBF
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x7926127F
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x482AE2E1
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x8E4DB57F
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x73956814
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0xCBD99D88
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x68E4AE79

0xB04A0E33
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0xCC58875D
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0xF50438ED
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0x5CD59DDF
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0xBDFB6393
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0xB566AB24
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x5030A250
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x0519A44B
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x481FA7E4
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x88411AEB
plot against me."
0x0A8B9D28

0xB04A0E33
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0xEFB90DE9
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0xD67069B8
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xA2A13FA3
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0x8413BD2C
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0xE85A8FA3
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0xA0ED97AC
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x8CCAFEB2
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x51508694
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x42811BFC
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x3D0BD659
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0x5915F4A5
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x52C8CB08
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0x27A3E862
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0xAF0B6957
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0x725AE50A

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x289CBB1B
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x469AEAFB
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x9805F035
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0x7EA6539A
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0xA205762B
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0xF543F8A7
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x3106B941
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0xB41BD5B9
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x501056EC
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0xA097D881

0xB04A0E33
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0x75975BC4
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0x404983F3
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x9EF31C1F
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0x49992600
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x41EEA7F4
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x472D11E5
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0xD6ADF208
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0xA63B9176

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xC5429FE7

0xB04A0E33
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0x845F6378
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0x08A8E125
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0x1FFD046E
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0x7C064401
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0xB310D456
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0xB13E8AC5
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xAED98C94
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x527DD046
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0xA3E72B06
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x08D8391B
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0x126FB57F

0xB04A0E33
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0xD5419E02

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0xE67A5FD2
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0xAE3557B0
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x8B4C0206
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x0A4566ED
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x76789B48
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x5597AA10
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x835809E0
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x0F5D4831
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0xC55582AE
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0xF209FED3
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0x25375D90
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x299ACD76
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x976FC5C3
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0x4350643C

0xB04A0E33
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0xB0ED460C
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0xA47168F6
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0xB22AE2B0
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0x5E6AD835
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x4E1657EF
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0x8169BD41
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xFF865DD5
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x81BE6B12
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0x2583CEFC
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0xBA1282B9
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x7CA84C69
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0xFC970A43
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0x2C87A307
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xBD077F38
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0xF43624BD
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
0x1B96A2BF

0xB04A0E33
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0xB6B5A31D
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0xDA163604
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0xFEE7629B
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0x98EFF61C
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x31F9F313
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0x116343A5

0xB04A0E33
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0xBBB28283
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0x937C05CC
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0xABA21A80
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0x3AB9BA53
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0x0AB238AB

0xB04A0E33
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0xE43A1CE6
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0x5127108B
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0x63639438
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0xE4DA5340
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0xBA9887C7
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0x9E809149
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0xFC38D8A0
follow.
0x158DDCCE

0xB04A0E33
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0xAA9D1725
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0xA5244EE7
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0x6B6C1B35
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0xE412B27A
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0x7812F7C2
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0x2FAB4CAF
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0x1B64AEF0

0xB04A0E33
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0x73716FA4
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0xF1C0C9C0
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0x1C581307
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0xC8CED268
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0x24A6181A
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0xBE2D2A2C
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0xF8D75D54
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0xBF94DC93
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0x79DACB98
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0xF4CA0740
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0x1034BA27
and leave her.'
0x5886A537

0xB04A0E33
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0x0D724510
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0x5413D939
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0xD10E246A
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0x739B895D
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x03C7F6C2
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0xEEA1E7C3
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x669811E2
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0xE45AAB99
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0x33D2A0C0

0xB04A0E33
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0x4E75C980
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0x8CD519A6
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0x73A6CAC5
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0x516D1F2F
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0x71FFFFA3
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0xD813B498
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x2594E665
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0x4A29FCEF
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0x2D765053
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0x36BE16B9
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x4FA22EAE
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0x66B28DF1
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0xC6F07E9F
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0xDBBD0F4A
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x7EB6E763
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0xBA66B1D3
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x698E5496
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x989C1C04
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x38FA2371
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x086E4E90
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0x8BDF1C09
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0xE131DC02
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x692FD667
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x24F14674
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x2715353B
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0x400A7B42
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0x28843D7D

0xB04A0E33
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0x05654FDA
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0x3DEC6306

0xB04A0E33
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0x859B820B
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0xC9C6E748
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0xF54A6DC5
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x6A356C23
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0xE4A23958

0xB04A0E33
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x64C17CF1

0xB04A0E33
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0x65B76E3C
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0xAEEB307B
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x8B2C73B7
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0x6F29AF02
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0xDD6904F7
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x71333517
burdened."
0xFA94745C

0xB04A0E33
"Well, sir?"
0xCF2101C7

0xB04A0E33
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0x789163D0
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0xF9630A42
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x7FC1BAE3
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0xDBE4F136
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0x254114DD
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0xF388ECAB
don't very well know why."
0x9858DA1F

0xB04A0E33
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0x9A5CB920

0xB04A0E33
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0xC9DF250A

0xB04A0E33
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0x5CAC41DC
and what she said."
0xA74B9572

0xB04A0E33
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0xA24A096B
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0xE42C4F23
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x411AE1D6
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0xB9C9B5BB
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0xB33C971A
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x2C37A277
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x8D7D1F2F
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xBA3E86CF
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0xFA7DA443
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0xDCF7525B
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0x7A1DB1F9
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x4450650D
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x2BB033AA
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0xC07555A0
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x65DE0529
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xBABBA396
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0xE4186BC6
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0x746F3778
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x2CE7AF2C
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0x69F0E904

0xB04A0E33
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0xA39EB562
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0x7B6A1991
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0xE0039206
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x9707EF77
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0xCC34ECA2
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0x480ECFCA
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x25430E75
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x86FCC0C7
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x1A655C53
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x3012E056
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0xFC34F9CE
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0xA4B6EFEC

0xB04A0E33
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x69CFEF8D
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x38F7F47E
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0xF9024156

0xB04A0E33
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0x48A570DA
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0xCDA0E9FE
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0x627581C6
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x4AE3A992
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0x4C606CCA
Giacinta, and Clara."
0x02B7AB5D

0xB04A0E33
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x7747CFA9
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x127C4B24
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0xDC2F5180
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0xEAE4DF39
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0x5FBD10A4
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0x0BAF05BD
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x44E7D8BF
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x79767662

0xB04A0E33
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0xBEA7B0E1
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x93B89410
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0xA7DBEEF5
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0xF8AB8CEA
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0x2CDB1BA1
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0xEB7E14AD
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x6CA16B5F
back to England.
0xF08B1E8F

0xB04A0E33
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0xE011B8C4
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xB257CCBA
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xE610548A
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x1D8DF586
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x0FEFD151
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x1F5C6426
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x2C988BDB
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0xFC7BE1CA
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0xB5B51349
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x9A2DA4A4
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xE7A13511
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x917ED37E

0xB04A0E33
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x83D9FE26
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xDC843651
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xE1533900
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x7B558BEA
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x312DAA91
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x875774DB
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x5001EC1D
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0x35C2C2F1
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x063760AA
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x7814A281
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x8CA34149
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x9FB4AE1F
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x270B9952
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x25521547
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0xD97E7A1A
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xC298F593
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xC77959E5
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x74C2C052
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x5323D44E
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x98C55DC1
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0xF46085B9
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0x68EA2F58
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0xA384F6C6
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0x79E9EAB6
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0xD8550C1A
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x528903DF
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x72726754
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x177F1EC4
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x72CC53D3
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x182A838B
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xA67F6D08
out of my sight.
0x5B1A52B6

0xB04A0E33
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xCA3C15BD
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0xEDC73014
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x0FEA493D
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x94576013
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0xB44D4362
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0xE6EEB674
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x503AE76B
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x4F6076A0
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x242A4DD9
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x242690A1
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x369034CD
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xFF66AE2F
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0xA700511D
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0xB1851D54
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0x8287B100
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xC963687B
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x6F4F7F47
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x80E17AB1
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x270A9D04
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0xA03ED647
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xB39915A3
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0xB13132E8
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xEAB2DA47
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xA3D6B417
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x36BE5515
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0xA7EAE5B7
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x869327BD
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x0045F00C
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x9B5DD5FF
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x95017FFA
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0x0971703F
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0xC2A52D0F
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0x1DD16582
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x4D7658E6

0xB04A0E33
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x030C400D
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x3E5E50A9
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0x82BD801B
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x92116707
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x06167E91
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0xB8C55195
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0xA6ACA8D3
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0xD9BAA092
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x37DD8E1C
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x5A465D9F
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x2B11185F
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x22F20FBE
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0xAED2493B
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0xC9AE28E1

0xB04A0E33
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x93549A72
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0x663D233E
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0x7BC7F848
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0x7BE8258F

0xB04A0E33
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0xF4B2BED5
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0x7BFBFA67

0xB04A0E33
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0xB1890E71

0xB04A0E33
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x5AA999E6
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0xAE731CD1
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x14F9B418
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x47335EEF
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x2F9D1C90
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0x1279B60F
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x6985A758
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0x14DCA692

0xB04A0E33
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xD413F650
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x62E63E6E
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0xD0B0B40E
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0x0CCE72E0
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x36253902
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x267756CC
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0xED46844A
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0xAF57DF85
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0xC78F904B
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x655DA900
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0xA9D82651
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0xFC24BB6A

0xB04A0E33
A pause.
0xFD7CD01B

0xB04A0E33
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x03721A53

0xB04A0E33
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x1220B567
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0xA1DF4B73
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0xBE08265C
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0xCD9F8C2B
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x809B1E18

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x78943D8F
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0x906B51C5

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x72DD7899

0xB04A0E33
Another long silence.
0x2045F67C

0xB04A0E33
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xE208065C
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0xE718CB76
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0xC5FDCD4B
and to let me go another?"
0x400B3F78

0xB04A0E33
"I do."
0xBF17F520

0xB04A0E33
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x1CA94F0E

0xB04A0E33
"I do."
0xBF17F520

0xB04A0E33
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0x3E957D8D

0xB04A0E33
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0xFF06D444

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x1911ED2E
to love me."
0xA3464D7F

0xB04A0E33
"It would to obey you."
0xAA7042FE

0xB04A0E33
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0x1221EF41
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x9A38C2AA
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x33D8B3AE

0xB04A0E33
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0xED937B72
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x55EDC683
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x245870F6
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xDFEB7A98
companion and for some hope?"
0x809D0265

0xB04A0E33
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x0F8DE17C
again there."
0x69A8C5F2

0xB04A0E33
"Then you will not yield?"
0x27585526

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x9FC0E1BA
rose.
0x279A05DA

0xB04A0E33
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0xED85B6D1

0xB04A0E33
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0xC79401F5
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0xF9429289

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x939E4547
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x51107C33
will forget me before I forget you."
0xE3D5D4F4

0xB04A0E33
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0xE22392AF
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0xDA550C5D
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x5B3A7570
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0xEAE81B30
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x60D94A3D
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0xD39E9FCA
by living with me?"
0x70A1A1D4

0xB04A0E33
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0x8772BA9A
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0x6C38AF7C
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x50C39D37
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x2CFB2F4A
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0xACD89A8A
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0x25398699
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0xA9A1B242
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x5B6F3964

0xB04A0E33
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x35AAAA50
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x28800954
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0xE349791B
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0xBA92BD59
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0xD16EBB67
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x615D20FB
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0xA266A808
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0xF056B1AD
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x5FC1FBB1
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0xB7C81F61
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x4D290389
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x9A2BA81F
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0x0F7E6B41

0xB04A0E33
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0xF239ABB3
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x3A55CBF4
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0xCBDFA8BC
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0x27F256CB
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x0C9F0003
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x12A6C91C
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0x869B177E
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x3A5634FA
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0x9E1236D4
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x87C3F9FA
strength almost exhausted.
0xE1C7D62D

0xB04A0E33
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x5A75FB4E
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x57FBB5A4
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0xB0A5FBFE
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0x7C98BEFF
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x53377302
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0xFD0EA90D
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0xC32C1B20
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x4AD28C2C
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x2CFD3AE5
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x79652C84
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x560A380D
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0xF1980FA0
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x2C00B8B7
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x4434D8ED
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x76BFB643

0xB04A0E33
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0xC90FC0F5
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x60EF1EE2
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xA9FA36F8
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0xE1708959

0xB04A0E33
"You are going, Jane?"
0x06852279

0xB04A0E33
"I am going, sir."
0xD46107B4

0xB04A0E33
"You are leaving me?"
0xDEB0BC5E

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x07130227
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0xB30BADFD

0xB04A0E33
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x5EA2B799
firmly, "I am going."
0x259794FF

0xB04A0E33
"Jane!"
0xEF1D90AC

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x053AB6C1

0xB04A0E33
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x7E35D6CD
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xB3DA917D
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x51CFD18B

0xB04A0E33
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0xBDD1A084
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0xE0A9E815
deep, strong sob.
0x29C252D4

0xB04A0E33
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0xB6C03F19
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0xDE95241C
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0x9DC61140
hand.
0x4AAB7681

0xB04A0E33
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0xF7E96043
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0xCCDC90D8
me."
0x9BCD7F7D

0xB04A0E33
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0xAC218869
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0x1C84D3E4
yes--nobly, generously."
0x565242CC

0xB04A0E33
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xED56F77C
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x9F65D9FC
once quitted the room.
0x52CAC423

0xB04A0E33
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x82BC24DB
"Farewell for ever!"
0x5CAEB2D5

0xB04A0E33
* * * * *
0x7D6EF9DA

0xB04A0E33
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x68BBCF9E
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0xCF88A214
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x223696A2
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x9BE1CEAE
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xD797E445
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0xE5A3166A
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x7C280223
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x7DEA68DC
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x7317662A
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x6A95913D
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0xC26C4364
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0x9D159AB5
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x0DE02979
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x5B7D640C
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0x641308BC

0xB04A0E33
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x3B4DEC2A

0xB04A0E33
"Mother, I will."
0x6A5A9A14

0xB04A0E33
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x9601CE2D
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0xA2E9CA0A
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x7E34489A
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0xAD8EFD57
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x4110E8CB
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0xBA9ECDFB
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0xFD594D61
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0xA7631786
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xD6C4503D
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x3C09D31A
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x388E88A6
from my room.
0x4281A5D6

0xB04A0E33
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x1181B1CC
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x245EB5D5
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xA32569DC
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0x8443128C

0xB04A0E33
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xE474EB71
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x26A6BAEA
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0xC4777912
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x96BD2A92
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0xB2B2CB96
to go in and to say--
0xE6CDA3C0

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x11BFCAE5
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x3BF9B455
this.
0x2AB9BBFD

0xB04A0E33
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0xCC469C0B
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x81E308CB
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x11F52791
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0x36D58CB8
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x81FD4CC0
on.
0x8CA50CE3

0xB04A0E33
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0x7A68B58F
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0x21ADD3F7
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xEA79A8A7
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x6CB2B33A
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0xE902AD7D
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x8B43BCF8
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0xDFAF91DF
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x8688377B
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x2C295AE1

0xB04A0E33
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0xC6D1CB40
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x734D89AA
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x46B3AA6D
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x044B5167
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0xCFB7F9F2
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0xB87ECC95
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x11B6988D
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x1D70F1F5

0xB04A0E33
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0xCDF57B38
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x86A57342
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x71E23273
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xFAB6A206
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x9B88009B
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x10CFE6E3
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x14F3DEBC
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x92C71C1E
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x81320297
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xA08AF919
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x5EFD8C9C
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x06D78B3A
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x11F886E7
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x12533E1E
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x06825503
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0xE006A164
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xC6BF3082
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x9181CBBC
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0xE2D732ED
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0xF148B548
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x28220CB9
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x6D236526
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0x57FEE536
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x76CD057B
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x00627249
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x071DD85E
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x61DE26F7
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x06E16181
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x2FB50589
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0x1808D710
ever to reach the road.
0x63AB4BA6

0xB04A0E33
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x0D64F0AF
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0x9708CCF8
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x4370E9A2
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0xA2515375
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x680D5594
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x2D01E913
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x1DD0CCF5
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0xB3AFD302

0xB04A0E33
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x90D39CDD
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0x720553C8
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x3C0B6F0B
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xECBD1126
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0xD5AAA000

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0xEC79F098
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0xE56C1E2B
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xA662A3E7
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x950B59AB
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0xC3319AA7
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0xAF295BAC
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0xBC3AD9B9

0xB04A0E33
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x29607FF9
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xD49A3BCD
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x0EF07D30
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0xF0A254C8
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0xF40080CC
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xD2B66E30
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0x0FCBB37A
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xE892239E
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x06F0A33F
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x627EA1B5
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x4D0545E7
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x2AA817DB
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x9692EF00
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x230FFA84
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x5C74AEC3
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x0931DC98
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x45C995BF
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0xCF2D24F2
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0xB7E4CA16
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0x84608CF0

0xB04A0E33
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0xBD150202
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x6991A05F
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0xEE679335
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x72954243
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0xC3A5BE93

0xB04A0E33
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0xBB0C8A02
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x698B26D9
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0xD7D12C25
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xD638D05F
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x7B9BBE77
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0x422BBCE7
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0xA00BEA3C
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x30E2CCDB

0xB04A0E33
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x6B9A9156
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0xFA2A5678
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x7A7481B3
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x9BB6094B
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0x4ED689CD
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x94D14396

0xB04A0E33
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0x754218F1
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x934CF919
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x91D9848B
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0xB7B6C0C8
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0x089A08DC
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x27BECDD4
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x5A41A904
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x79D6090A
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0x476D2682
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0x97F196BD
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0x13F26187
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x162BF46B
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x4A5A3F02
then chose my couch.
0x8D4BA04C

0xB04A0E33
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x5942DFAE

0xB04A0E33
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x98E764D2
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x4C47A293
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x540B0861
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0xB7AFF773
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x7BD70017

0xB04A0E33
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x5488AB3D
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0x79DF76AF
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x449EB6ED
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x1489DC1F
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xCD4379B7
attempts to seek him.
0x8BE20653

0xB04A0E33
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0xE295C139
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x5CB25EEE
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0x47FB5346
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0xAC9E84CD
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0x14744FAA
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0xB275E4A3
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0xA0F38DDC
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x2E226277
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x3DFB8E12
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x86A78D5D
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0x6C0A0E5C
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0xF9B44769
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0xFF3A7ACF
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0xEFFCCC9A
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x29B77A62
sleep forgot sorrow.
0xB270BF53

0xB04A0E33
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0xB07BCE01
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x739D75C2
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x03EC5CAD
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x88D0C70A
looked round me.
0x9349A172

0xB04A0E33
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x20D771B9
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x913C8CEB
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x02D4B978
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0xBABE144D
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x2A0FA26E
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0xEB89A1B5
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0xCA1E9186
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x658C1921
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x834DEAA4
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xCABBD8F0
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0xC6B5B257
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x9218A019
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xFAE7B183
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0x443E072B
out.
0x139629C1

0xB04A0E33
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0x76050CDF
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0xA420E866
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0xB6E20F3A
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0xA05367DC
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x5AD6ED3A
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0x9EC6E1E1
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x7361A049

0xB04A0E33
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0xA56ED038
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x4EED9897
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0x10CFA8D2
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0xAC09AAE5
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x9FA293CD
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0xFCB9A819
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x396AC47C
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x97353597
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0xC07FB1FB
like the rest.
0x46D518EA

0xB04A0E33
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0x01806320
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x8D79F64B
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x9500A857
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0xB22F72AC
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0xFC41B540
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x2709B988
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0xFD2AA697
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x22CD26A4
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x5271AB88
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x57FC8038
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x34770ABA
would not; but I must try.
0xB1AE5679

0xB04A0E33
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0xEF999A9E
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x92E677F5
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x4FDE49BB
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0xBDD33C30
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0xB89BA835
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x33CCAD1D
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x50D20CBA
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0xD6D5A84E
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x9B44EEEF
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0xDA6B03C3
the village?"
0xC5CBD598

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0xC0DEA1F4

0xB04A0E33
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x1C84414B
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0x4EEE9526
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x42775539
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x448BB0E6

0xB04A0E33
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x1AA92276
wanted?"
0xE9EFC551

0xB04A0E33
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x3725A334

0xB04A0E33
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x6BC38088
do?"
0xB4E1D0BC

0xB04A0E33
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0xEBF0BDF3
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x6F58C4F1

0xB04A0E33
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0xF40E44A0

0xB04A0E33
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x8A1C3619

0xB04A0E33
"And what do the women do?"
0xA2B487B6

0xB04A0E33
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x792F0B17
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x91B5D883

0xB04A0E33
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0xD3688267
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xB3A794E9
wanted.  I took leave.
0x446F4AB7

0xB04A0E33
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x3D2EB6A4
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x5702C32D
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x662883FD
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x15A07501
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0xE035E63D
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0x5D30EE21
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0x942DCE85
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0xB35B367A
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x193706E0
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0xD9B34A6C
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x113890C5
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0x88006129
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0x824B5C85
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xAB0216CB
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x5D49DE25
if a servant was wanted here?
0xFCB6389A

0xB04A0E33
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x3CEDCDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0xF07B6488
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xB0C8CDF9
no matter what."
0x54668BEF

0xB04A0E33
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x20BF13AB
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x7E8A63CC
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x6F241CB5
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0x4A8F6A7F
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0xD428BAFD
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0xEA3AF4AD

0xB04A0E33
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x3B5FAD86
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0xA7F9B411
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x5FC65295
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xBD638E60
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x85933422
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0xDB7C0B33
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0xAE56C863

0xB04A0E33
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x3F89AF3D
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x5651C39B
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xB43293BC
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x0CA221EA
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x7B55532A
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0xA8E6EFA5
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0xEC1DD8B2
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xB715CCBA
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xDF1FB92F
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0x91D49F95
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x6EF9A1C9
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0x73077986
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xF2DF6CAE
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x8615A0D9
this the parsonage?
0x24B57162

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Was the clergyman in?"
0xCD3BF404

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Would he be in soon?"
0x597E1B0A

0xB04A0E33
"No, he was gone from home."
0x5EE635C8

0xB04A0E33
"To a distance?"
0x0075CBF1

0xB04A0E33
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x8F8B136C
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xC5B30506
there a fortnight longer."
0x1EDFE5DE

0xB04A0E33
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x129983A9

0xB04A0E33
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x8722AA6A
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x782CFB69
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x13D7F221

0xB04A0E33
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0xEE3DE98A
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0xCE2F126C
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0xDB6327C9
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x2F4F88B6
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0xFA7E88AF
for this handkerchief?"
0x43E06476

0xB04A0E33
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0x51E167D9
that way."
0x7DE69132

0xB04A0E33
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x29508437
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0xD4210BD0

0xB04A0E33
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x728F78B4

0xB04A0E33
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xCEA6AA98

0xB04A0E33
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x578073F9
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0x721BFB53
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x5AB5053F
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0x6DDA400D
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x149863E2
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x87BFAFF2
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xA88E63AA
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x755689B8
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x855D9B7F
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xB09129E2
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0xC0696348
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0xF78169C7
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x80AF8BD1
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0xE0FF1FD2

0xB04A0E33
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0xD43C09D7
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x7B63558C
said--
0x873BFE59

0xB04A0E33
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x6D39AFA0
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x9E03A0FD
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x83710778
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0xC7F61378
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x030D2D55

0xB04A0E33
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0x426E5721
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x4639E161
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0xEFD8573A
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xFB684D02
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x41B51D53
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xAE6D8FC2
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0x71E68FD9
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0xE2AE1688
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x08B9F5C0
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x1818ABC1

0xB04A0E33
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0xE7250F9B

0xB04A0E33
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xBA5FBAA5
give her these porridge."
0xBEBA8ECF

0xB04A0E33
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x367D6F9B
pig doesn't want it."
0x412A357C

0xB04A0E33
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0xE6113160
ravenously.
0x49389B05

0xB04A0E33
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x5B9417E8
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0xE838E425

0xB04A0E33
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x7A39B91E
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x12005236
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0x454CF6D5
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x5C0A935A
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0xEAD51480
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xB17F5E94
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x153353AD
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0x37F8EB35
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x095CC00F
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0xBE667A0D
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x8C87AA82

0xB04A0E33
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0xBAD6173A
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x962347A6
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x4106C5BC
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x0E963E68
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0xA91C5DF4
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x7750011C

0xB04A0E33
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0xB2B8480E
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x9E80F30E
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0x0EB3ECC3
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0xB194EDB0
grave."
0x3F238F89

0xB04A0E33
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0x00DE9849
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x395B0E19
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x82F759B2
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x434A55B9
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0xEF4BD9CB
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xA1C43953
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0xA10F90AD

0xB04A0E33
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0x622009CC
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x99BBDE3A
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x84C43004
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0xC17D8C93
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x6E16439F
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x3C1B6652
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0x5ED17871
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x2095A59A
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x1907C98F
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0x1EB960C0
it shut in my face."
0x4DFC8CDB

0xB04A0E33
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0x58930DA4
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0x9E95B344
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0xA2A6AE8C
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0x1770B74B
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x61A19A7F
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x0E0A04BF
long.
0xA988F50E

0xB04A0E33
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x6893F996
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x78A6F9DA
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x143131CF
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0xAD6663C0
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0xD7E4C4C7
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0xC47403F9

0xB04A0E33
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0xC9B3A2D6
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x5EEB4DAA
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x40C6CDF3
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x40D596D3
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0x847763F2
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x86F47A54
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x1B9BFA6A
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xF1DD5058
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0xBD28C357
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0xF69A4D47
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x00A88472

0xB04A0E33
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0xB1DF6541
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0xAA0A6C91
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x197162F0
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0xE766818C
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x6D122EFB
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x5AEBA9F4
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xCA2B5DE4
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x6612EC03
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0x4DB465A4
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x106A9E8A
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xB111AE86
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0xCEED6C6F
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x07F248EA
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0xB820D790
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x46621156
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x8C8C0CB2
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x3C7D669E

0xB04A0E33
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x90767342
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x3618AAC9
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x6FEDD094
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0x5E877690
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x34598E03
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0xCB52C57A
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x58826251
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xA5BFE13A

0xB04A0E33
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0xC3CA336A
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x67270D40
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0xAAB8F6E8
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0xE1221AA2
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x52D3BC25
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x76A6B1E3
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x5E00922A
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xC6C33323
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x3D67C281
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x46F81C0C
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x4CB8EAD2
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xB24662F4
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0xB3DC5C15
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x47735754
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x147B2456
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0xB11CD926

0xB04A0E33
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x5033AD94
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xEB0E6049
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0xA90B1300
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0xE3F85899
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x04878CD2
German I could not tell.
0xC506E988

0xB04A0E33
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x937AC1DE
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x501E3714
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0xB9AB3C1B
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x4C273AED
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x858C70A6
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0x7BD9218D

0xB04A0E33
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0xF323CD8F
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x9B7A450F
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0xF1215CF6
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x7292FC3D
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x38A8153C

0xB04A0E33
Both were again silent.
0x7C02812C

0xB04A0E33
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0x567F5F74
looking up from her knitting.
0x928696D6

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0x332DD229
other way."
0xB6876CD4

0xB04A0E33
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x847A134F
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0xF02C81A7

0xB04A0E33
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0xDD4AB5DF
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0xA73D6A51
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0xF6B7DD4E

0xB04A0E33
"And what good does it do you?"
0x0FCF4FD8

0xB04A0E33
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x66D10825
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0xF0E2EC24

0xB04A0E33
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0xD647E7AE

0xB04A0E33
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x0B65AB98

0xB04A0E33
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0xEFF0D8C4
master but a lexicon."
0xEB9B1F4D

0xB04A0E33
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0xE9205322
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0xE4BC0F43

0xB04A0E33
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0x6E81999E
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x393AE7E8
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0x8F3E22C9

0xB04A0E33
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0xABF90C87
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xD7207C34

0xB04A0E33
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0xE786D509
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0xCF967F6D

0xB04A0E33
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x0DA69E28
sad now.
0x9D56FB84

0xB04A0E33
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x0B3110F7
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x44C439D9

0xB04A0E33
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x776C867B

0xB04A0E33
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0xB6E79622
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x131E1860
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0xDCC38710
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xCF4A4AE8
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x45D2C205
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x59678067
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0xC2AABBB5
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x15912A88
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x975F8097
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x6175FF5D

0xB04A0E33
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0xFD190436
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x65647A88
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x6980018D
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x1B4B79F5
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xDA298750
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0xF97C6E67
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x5461DB89

0xB04A0E33
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x9A85274F
St. John when he comes in."
0xA027A13A

0xB04A0E33
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0xC3E6D27B
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x4322B58B
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x27DE08F4
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x261E0146
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x0827AE6F
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0x44AAC79E
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x38902FCC
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x49E959A6
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x7064ACBD
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x83AE805B

0xB04A0E33
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x84C6D3CD
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xB2E9EB3E

0xB04A0E33
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0xBA1731F3

0xB04A0E33
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x7218544D
from?"
0xF4719968

0xB04A0E33
"I am a stranger."
0x6D006886

0xB04A0E33
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x2EE76019

0xB04A0E33
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0xB4AF1CA0
bread to eat."
0x1276C082

0xB04A0E33
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0xB692CBE8
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0xD53C50F5
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0xBADE8A93

0xB04A0E33
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xC48316DE

0xB04A0E33
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0xD323ADAE
now; it looks very ill."
0xCD7C487A

0xB04A0E33
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x152EC026

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x50BB45AC
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x60CBB4CB

0xB04A0E33
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x8B2F9A36
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x03D5CB51

0xB04A0E33
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0xED1CB776

0xB04A0E33
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x83D14C18

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x1FD6674A
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x335BC333

0xB04A0E33
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0xBA10DDA8

0xB04A0E33
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0xBF072BEC
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x2ECDC1E1
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x8DE1906A
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0xD3630330
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0x139BC429
bolted it within.
0x682693DC

0xB04A0E33
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x13CECAAC
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0xCAEC604D
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0xE1E0E758
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0x2B8298D5
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x9D954DCA
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0xBC79BE13
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x6EBD1FA3
endeavoured to regain.
0x87325FDA

0xB04A0E33
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x1DF2F872
will in silence."
0x9615F4BC

0xB04A0E33
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0x4B3C7FE0
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0x1EC7F5B3
and still.
0xFB73F3C3

0xB04A0E33
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x7909C2FA
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0xC0295277
if you perished here of want."
0x09C13731

0xB04A0E33
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x39301014
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x72E73F48
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0x64BE8D8A
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x5874430A
to the door.
0x2AE02AEB

0xB04A0E33
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x6BEE7E10

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x1E7CD181

0xB04A0E33
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0xA521A9AF
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0xE91ED0F2
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x305D9AB3
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x2455E4CA

0xB04A0E33
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0xCCF63C69
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0xC6C7253E
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x24B3E990
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0xE2D6F3BB
house."
0x5413AC11

0xB04A0E33
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x847CEC18

0xB04A0E33
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0x1BEB3194
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0xC773B689
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xAA288F2F
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x1003C28B
me.
0x6009299D

0xB04A0E33
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0x4976988A

0xB04A0E33
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0x7919DFEF

0xB04A0E33
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x18CE62A7

0xB04A0E33
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0xBEEAC08E
sit."
0x137CEABB

0xB04A0E33
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xB9E713F2
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x4AF2F6DD

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x729F5AEE
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0x96F0E764

0xB04A0E33
"A mere spectre!"
0x7E3B5158

0xB04A0E33
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x14DE4BFC

0xB04A0E33
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xA2C9A3EB
bread."
0xB6DB4507

0xB04A0E33
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0xADF5F8F6
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x0B4B1AA4
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x862578A6
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x5526178B
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xF2241B56

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x16F58FF4
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x349CCB79
first, eagerly soon.
0x4C5AACDA

0xB04A0E33
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0x9457A0D3
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0x01E982AA

0xB04A0E33
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x9D9F10F2

0xB04A0E33
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0xB185A23D
name."
0x8248D789

0xB04A0E33
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x5E98B7FF
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0xB916F9B6

0xB04A0E33
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x1C402C31

0xB04A0E33
I was silent.
0xF3AEF391

0xB04A0E33
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0xC717AFA5

0xB04A0E33
I shook my head.
0x279CFDF7

0xB04A0E33
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0xCABB271F

0xB04A0E33
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x12FFB821
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xB1BBA6C7
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0x64EF3962
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x6029D56F
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0x18F7D7D1
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x176916A8

0xB04A0E33
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x8D11A7D7

0xB04A0E33
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x3F97E232

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x05264B31
took the word--
0x70AC45DA

0xB04A0E33
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x67C75421
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0x47ECFF29

0xB04A0E33
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x27E70E9D
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0xD5B780A1
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0x4C49A32C
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x85C4E1BE
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x0D177BC9
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xB3FEC3D8
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x8DF98CAD
silent.
0x99AB8E04

0xB04A0E33
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0x70B67F3A
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0xE031CD76
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x9B5034A0
matter over."
0x8F47BF00

0xB04A0E33
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0x71C37D53
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xB68DDD2C
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0x1B97FE51
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0x5FBD5D0D
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x5B1F4E46
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x7F52376E
joy--and slept.
0x489BF9CD

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXIX
0x5CE4100A

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0xE1197DF6
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0xBA05C8AE
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0xB1E52D1E
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xB2C59E75
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x19E211AE
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0x85D94811
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x3F9748B1
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0xA7D5EAE9
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0xF9DF3B23
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0xABE4F837
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x10D15E51
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x0395703B
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0xF48D4942
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xD19657F1
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0xB8A727E1

0xB04A0E33
"It is very well we took her in."
0xD9DA0366

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0x07493758
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x7C472112

0xB04A0E33
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0xA5E1AD16

0xB04A0E33
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0xB5D8D2EB
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x3A05AB61
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0xE0A4F8B7

0xB04A0E33
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0x76245334
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x10E036A0
would be agreeable."
0xAF30707D

0xB04A0E33
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xB102E3C3
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0xCC3C19C1
myself.  I was comforted.
0x7375C504

0xB04A0E33
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x0AC67340
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0x7003720F
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x6BE7ADEA
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0x496DE1A6
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0xD98BF5C1
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x40E0C792
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x1ED54A42
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0xE17DD748
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x57045F1E
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x048FC311

0xB04A0E33
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x10386700
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0x75C8C2AD
her permanently."
0x5CCD77E0

0xB04A0E33
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x26FC6A02
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xAD5321BD
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x1B91E352
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x5E3C6E85
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0xA6717CE0
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0xA7FF78D1

0xB04A0E33
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x7D8A659D

0xB04A0E33
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x95C604CA
are quite wanting in those features."
0xEAE97CA3

0xB04A0E33
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0x3447370A
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x0CCAA4F4
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0xCF3D538A
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x074E08B5
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x9FDCB927
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0xF706072B
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x8CA19EE0
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0x4A38684A
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x748CB3C2

0xB04A0E33
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x6F0D2D91
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xF31BC974
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xEFF3C20D
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0x190BF39A
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x2861F1AF
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0x06CCC904
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x757BD337
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x86106935
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x78654460
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x0A543973
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0xB16BE3B2
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x509B408D

0xB04A0E33
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xAE49ECFF
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0x15A206D9
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x2019798B
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0xD7F69983
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x68823FAE
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x6915BA04
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x8396FE7F

0xB04A0E33
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x48237586
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x59C09B7F

0xB04A0E33
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0xAA22EC82
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x3280A765
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xDF3D685C

0xB04A0E33
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0x6B1EFC17

0xB04A0E33
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xC08F89BF
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xD9DD2EB0
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x41252081

0xB04A0E33
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0x9A15C517
than yourself or your young ladies."
0x8D227F13

0xB04A0E33
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x257707EC
nor no brass, I guess?"
0xCB32E445

0xB04A0E33
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0xFCB6075A
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x333FB3FA

0xB04A0E33
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0xACF65DBA

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, very."
0xC6344D40

0xB04A0E33
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x5166CE74

0xB04A0E33
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x22DAB9E5

0xB04A0E33
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x5EF97FDC

0xB04A0E33
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0xADE0F27F
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x9C595E35
basket of the fruit.
0x42A31842

0xB04A0E33
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x07E88367

0xB04A0E33
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x08727A4A

0xB04A0E33
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x67112187

0xB04A0E33
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0xD046F664

0xB04A0E33
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x722BBD4D
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x1072A6AD

0xB04A0E33
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x02059EF4
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0xD1C1E4DC

0xB04A0E33
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0xCA3258B0
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x75F147A5
are."
0xB28F5C72

0xB04A0E33
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x8F85A242

0xB04A0E33
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xF16A60C3

0xB04A0E33
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0xD29681B0
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xD75A1FC4

0xB04A0E33
"That village a few miles off?
0x87DADCD9

0xB04A0E33
"Aye."
0xD9C33930

0xB04A0E33
"And what is he?"
0xD1A971B9

0xB04A0E33
"He is a parson."
0x80855CFF

0xB04A0E33
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x89E6A073
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0xA1C37E70
residence?"
0xDEA66598

0xB04A0E33
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0xC3332490
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x5B8781FF

0xB04A0E33
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0xD278C95D

0xB04A0E33
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0xEF124A40

0xB04A0E33
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0xE5D19708

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Their father is dead?"
0x8D924A01

0xB04A0E33
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x6203F132

0xB04A0E33
"They have no mother?"
0x80C5FB56

0xB04A0E33
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x8CC89D88

0xB04A0E33
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x83F3FF88

0xB04A0E33
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0xD173C3E0

0xB04A0E33
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0xA3E7792C
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0xF9CA95CE
beggar."
0x243BA8D5

0xB04A0E33
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x1FB52AEB
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0xA7FBB6E0
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0xD208FEDD

0xB04A0E33
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x6591CEA3
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x3070085F

0xB04A0E33
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x91AA797F
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x2A341A67
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0xC10ECE1E

0xB04A0E33
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x0323E8D7

0xB04A0E33
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x2390E522

0xB04A0E33
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xDF38A1A2
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x56D982C0
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0x8110AC42
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x1870871D
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0xC4182789
to consider poverty a crime."
0xCA123BB3

0xB04A0E33
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0xEA40BF41
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0x14DC7716
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x7621272B

0xB04A0E33
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0xF890EF2F

0xB04A0E33
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0xB5EC7D19
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x8DD951A5

0xB04A0E33
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0xF7FE7111
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x8139603C
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x80553115
the young people.
0x21933658

0xB04A0E33
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x1C5D610B
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0xC651CF9C
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x3CD10C88
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x9A4580EE
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0xD58DE6E9
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x1659EB66
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x8B04F030
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0xFAAA2AE5
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0xAB2B2459
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0xDC44B0D5
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0x5E383444
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0xFEFFEBCE
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0xAF8CC6EA
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0xE28800A7
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xD5C1DCD4
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x686F2ADD
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x16B6034F
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x670AD612
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0x55808F63
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x9A86B09B
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x593CDE9E
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x4CC08C52
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x4AD64DE6
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xDC2FD5A0
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x01102FFC
for being united.
0x18962D6E

0xB04A0E33
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x7318BD9C
ladies and their brother were now.
0x13317753

0xB04A0E33
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x5CA228BC
to tea."
0xA0799B85

0xB04A0E33
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0x253F2293
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x8A5AD689
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x503F3075
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0xB4AC221E
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x42D8DCC7

0xB04A0E33
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0x7C02A6AE
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0xE1B00AB5

0xB04A0E33
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x5A35BB6F
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x10A0DF31
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x584632D8
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x9B16792E
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x1A0A7127
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0x57AFAA7D
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0xFAD997B8
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x282C7FE3
will.
0xA20B84CF

0xB04A0E33
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0xF71F3108
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0x94071564
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x230A2F1B
parlour."
0x6A788C61

0xB04A0E33
"I am very well here."
0xE566BA3F

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x0C4D549D

0xB04A0E33
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x5E46C20F

0xB04A0E33
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x900C9102
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0x849CA307

0xB04A0E33
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x79A15CAD
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x3271E3E7
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x514D53B2
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xE6E2A4B4

0xB04A0E33
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x92A855D6
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x793CAE80
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x78F56303

0xB04A0E33
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0xACFBA525
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x325356A9
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0xCC106C49
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x54CD13CE
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0xEF6E61E7
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x58F7F84F
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0xF758D8E5
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x63817AAC
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0xDA2D6AD9
and well saved.
0x28F951E7

0xB04A0E33
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x9418FAE4
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xEFFC0ABF
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0xC7172BD8
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x43EE9598
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x78B23AEB
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x24D2EAA2
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x30E7EFAB
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x58C34E96
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x1A394E8E
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x198BEDFE
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0x00B1187C
fair hair.
0x63C62A14

0xB04A0E33
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0xB3609169
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0xA8965948
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x94681663
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xABA67ADE
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0xA1666733
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x9BD158A3
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x50119FE1
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0xEA3AB928
of the oven.
0x0ECC53FD

0xB04A0E33
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0xEC67C868
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0xF1C4EB40

0xB04A0E33
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x58B52ECE
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0xA7EBE5D8
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0xE6C87B15
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x8DBAFF84
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x5289CA4B
from the stranger.
0x244AE7D9

0xB04A0E33
"You are very hungry," he said.
0xF1F896FD

0xB04A0E33
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xCD0C6877
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x8792BB74

0xB04A0E33
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0xB7398541
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x71696125
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x6CB67F6D
immoderately."
0x292C8881

0xB04A0E33
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0xF7ABB719
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x77BAC22B

0xB04A0E33
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x5A7692A2
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x9344DCBA

0xB04A0E33
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xACF42650
absolutely without home and friends."
0x97FC06AA

0xB04A0E33
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0xAF7E1F3E
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0xC924D64C
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0x0858E295
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x42C4278E
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x8A12D901
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x5977E33B
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x4B1886C3
to encourage.
0xD0E38E75

0xB04A0E33
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xA25E7D62
every connection?"
0x5423B2C8

0xB04A0E33
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0xC09C9991
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x8DC3AF7C

0xB04A0E33
"A most singular position at your age!"
0x13E9816A

0xB04A0E33
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x9A276A47
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0x8A46F652
explained the quest.
0x249987A8

0xB04A0E33
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x0AAA2A62

0xB04A0E33
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x113499E4
St. John," said she.
0x94DEA49D

0xB04A0E33
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x091B9EA4

0xB04A0E33
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0xB2A2F6C1
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x03EC7297
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x11F3B11F
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x4EABA6EA
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x3FE0800F
out tears as well as colour.
0xB6FB31F3

0xB04A0E33
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x8BC7371B

0xB04A0E33
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0xCF7A5F4E
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0xCBB06D04
piercing look.
0x20A14F8F

0xB04A0E33
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0xAD28F76C
secret," I replied concisely.
0x48801BC3

0xB04A0E33
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0x988A839B
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x7418E18E

0xB04A0E33
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xF73EFE54
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x1F0E5892

0xB04A0E33
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x995C3769
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0xE228A1A1
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x4C609D88

0xB04A0E33
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0x04FB4D9B
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x1A9F9B80
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0x52F0F434

0xB04A0E33
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0xDE0A4F30
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0xD251437E
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x9A15983B

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0xE0B51B9F
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x487E00C4
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x30902094
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0x8382A55A
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x0ED11174
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xD6C2EA42
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0x5FE4CE64
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0x93E66F8E

0xB04A0E33
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x2349960B
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0x378DAFBC
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x46A4D131
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x686389EF
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x5ED6D0D9
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x6C98FFCF

0xB04A0E33
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xD31FC726

0xB04A0E33
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x2D505EEC
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x70C544A5
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x3EC0D2B6
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0xF761FC99
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0x8931B97D
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0xE2AE3A00
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x7AA1AD2D
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0xDE9817D9
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x818A860F
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0x7031DC13
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0xCA26536D
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x4B0B3EAF
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x9B67FB86
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0xD9C48527
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xE376BB7B
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x8D9AD6C1
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0xD6341ADA
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x1B7D9F75
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x516A2724
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0xB6714180

0xB04A0E33
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xABE1603D
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0xA9C20631
down now, Miss Elliott."
0x0D1DD849

0xB04A0E33
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x5083E194
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x54FDA72D
once.
0xD26407CB

0xB04A0E33
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x1777F8CE

0xB04A0E33
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x77F4EE73
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xC4E8752B
sounds strange to me."
0x29706984

0xB04A0E33
"Your real name you will not give?"
0xB06762FC

0xB04A0E33
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0xD369608E
lead to it, I avoid."
0x67E2DA49

0xB04A0E33
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x751E9BAD
be at peace a while."
0x55F56BFA

0xB04A0E33
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x305248EB
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x8745A247

0xB04A0E33
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0xC2122FEA
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0xF8813C32
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0xBD6B7143
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0xB3A6D2FF
us?"
0x0880C6F4

0xB04A0E33
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0xCF13D279
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x9047CB35
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x00419AA8
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0xDBEF9C65

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0xD239C995
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x24038DCE
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0xE44E35BA

0xB04A0E33
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0xE13C492D
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0xFA398253
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x8BA5C075
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0xEC9161EF
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0x3DD3597B
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x9C530107
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0xA4343757
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x2CEDF530

0xB04A0E33
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x86AB2C99
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x02D2747C
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0xEA399785

0xB04A0E33
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0x809C074B
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xE8315421

0xB04A0E33
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x8D9CA646
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0xA576D2EE

0xB04A0E33
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0x23CF74B1
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0xC133C71F
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0xE57A62A3

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x73BD37C8
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x16DDC2BB
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xAC1E6780
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x8F2E4408
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0xD565A8FF
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0x44531A85
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x99E548A8

0xB04A0E33
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x5AB7594E
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x403D7FC8
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xC001E495
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x2BC55860
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x0EC46E69
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xA170D71D
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x17E11300
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0xF41288D7
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0x9D6D4D14
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x2E3943EA
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0xE0CD8B31
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x05059C7A
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0x4B7F2327
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x3DC0209B
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0xD705FEA1
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x5296826A
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0xD7D455AB
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0x7089D82F
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x4378FB0D
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0xB4C47572
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x7E09208B
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x9E1AF914
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0xFD0A39AE
that entranced theirs.
0xE362E709

0xB04A0E33
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x18575876
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xE28A9926
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x9DD184F2
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x03B3DEAA
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x6DCDE732
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xFD272A18

0xB04A0E33
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0x72F1B5AB
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x09E3FDBB
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0xEB522C46
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0xA306171B
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x8A9A1A04
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x86873215
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0xD8050B9E
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0xB5E642E7
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0x3ADEF88C
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0xA1097A0A
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0xD9184F70
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0xE4052806
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0xF283B3B6
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x5CE6D5CB
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xF2D19D93
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xB3058A39
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0x9860B6B1

0xB04A0E33
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0xA60F1ACF
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0xD64A1796
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x2B5B0DD4
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x6951DA4A
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x9BB095ED

0xB04A0E33
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0xC2CEDEAD
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x1FA8069C
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0xF7525031
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0x43592629
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0xF5C7D248
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x3CCB9744
cheerful--
0x2B728AB0

0xB04A0E33
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0xDA7B5475
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0xE0971117
propose to myself?"
0x1F58E2E8

0xB04A0E33
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x394E1C79
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0x7B7AAA57

0xB04A0E33
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0xA0773475
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x7B5EF818
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x09CA5871
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x0CAD6FD0
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0xB845D480
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x385010F1
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0xF3B1F467
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xE74249FD
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x44D3EEE5
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x40961DE5

0xB04A0E33
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0x3D0F4D57
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x9FA43D28
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x705040CD
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x05F35285
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x63557D24
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0xA4626819
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x0511F57F
delights they could yield.
0x97F4C7F6

0xB04A0E33
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x44C2D9C1
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0xCB613520
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xC028918C
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0xEC7715C4
produced on me.
0x552D93A4

0xB04A0E33
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x5F5FC458
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0xD3C8B1AD
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x94FA9866
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x1FBAA2C8
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x570372E3
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0x9BF20B54
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0xDF891749
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x7B15B491
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0x4FC9DDE9
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0xFA744D92
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0xA1754CD9
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x1C24A9B0
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x1BEA6543
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x2407941E
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xB028232A
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x3DFF9E98
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0xFA549A1E
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xAFA7A751
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xD631710A
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x99EC4414

0xB04A0E33
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0xC9DC77AC
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x23D8FBA5
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x60FC4959
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0xA6D425CD
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x84555A81
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x16580177
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0xC18B3B01
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x05995B08
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x3BDF0EC5
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0x2D7CC279
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x19030247
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0xE5270F4D
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0xA4A8A868
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x2CC41F54
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x42887717
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0xD8632135

0xB04A0E33
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0xE4B1E98C

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x94B0F253
myself to undertake?"
0x08113519

0xB04A0E33
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x2DBF53AF
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0xB0E37312
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0xE745288A
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x44BCC295
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x11B83317

0xB04A0E33
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x90E08135

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x9254BDBC
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0xBCBE6761

0xB04A0E33
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x799E5E9D
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0xC98A1766
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x9832765B
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0xE2047171
interest to me.
0x4FC0AFF0

0xB04A0E33
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x478C48EE
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x4B71F6B0

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x62E0C235
you to accept."
0x3F3DD247

0xB04A0E33
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x12287E00
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0xAB1BEE47
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x758702B4
could have done, and with less trouble.
0xF7AC356B

0xB04A0E33
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xBE0D5706
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x54D19C21
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0xD6590C3D
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xBE6D6A65
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0xF81651C0
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0xE1176E93
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x3851C35A
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0x2BC07284
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x4CD1A89D
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x3C1DBF28
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x447D1312
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0xBA537EB7
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x11584CE4
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x7B586F87
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0xC3409B76

0xB04A0E33
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x0161D60A
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xEEA631A3
glance.  He resumed--
0x5C31A66A

0xB04A0E33
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0xBF91DF95
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x51915164
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x3CAF5FDD
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0xA5DBFE42
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x30C02A29
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0xAE48ED57
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0xC980DB17
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x665880F2
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0xDB994C67
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xB92F9B39

0xB04A0E33
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0xCE256024

0xB04A0E33
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x94E7DAAC
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0xC679B0D7
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x967DA8B4
succeeding observations.
0x01129AAD

0xB04A0E33
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0xE26152F7
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x03D4E232
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xFC235670
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0xE8827C39
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x17BF9F55

0xB04A0E33
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0x8D5BFDB6

0xB04A0E33
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0xDEE43602
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x6A5BFB44
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0xDD14B20B
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xF897A1AD
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x47F3E6CD
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x97D26696
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x70C144E5
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x69C56409
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0x97E3678F
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0xA13DB5A6
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xFC3EE9AF
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x5D24D979
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x577B136B
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0xE03ECE06
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xD65F72C4
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0xF83D95FA
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0x5D273303

0xB04A0E33
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x2EA114C9
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0x28037D6A
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x109362E5
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x1ADA19F1
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0x983C8BAB
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0xAF6C372F
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x1B3E6628
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0x83F19BF8
decision.
0x4EAC36EA

0xB04A0E33
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0xAD924404
heart."
0xEFCA7C11

0xB04A0E33
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x0022BAD6
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x7FF6237D
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0x278EDF19
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x2098CD05
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0x35A9B0E8

0xB04A0E33
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x0129D022

0xB04A0E33
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0xE3F75BD2

0xB04A0E33
"I do."
0xBF17F520

0xB04A0E33
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xD596EB0E
deeply gratified.
0xBFF528D5

0xB04A0E33
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0xF58034A2

0xB04A0E33
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0xCCAA9550
week."
0xF1F4D9EB

0xB04A0E33
"Very well: so be it."
0x73562262

0xB04A0E33
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0xC2FDE92C
me.  He shook his head.
0x1D8A8676

0xB04A0E33
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0xC24CD31F

0xB04A0E33
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0xE1DB7C57

0xB04A0E33
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x4417745E

0xB04A0E33
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x901DE26A
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x8B63EAF2

0xB04A0E33
"I am not ambitious."
0x67160EB1

0xB04A0E33
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x304B0504
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x34751DB5
it out?"
0x6DE1A476

0xB04A0E33
"I was speaking of myself."
0x03505F33

0xB04A0E33
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x17AC0D8F

0xB04A0E33
"What?"
0x65AB8C8F

0xB04A0E33
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x0E422C94
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xF0F371F3
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0xC2C2D20E
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0xB8EF1A2D
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x7A0AEAAB
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0xC95E18A8
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x8337E7FC
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0xA306F9D2
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0x9B62E2F3
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0x137DFB85
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xCE9687ED
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xDF5E82DC
some means."
0xC5EBDB9F

0xB04A0E33
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0xDDAE19ED
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0xBB888A81

0xB04A0E33
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x89B409B1
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0xF10887DD
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x8C013211
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0xFD91F919
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0xD438A593
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0xD7E9D368
parting for life.
0x5367B2E6

0xB04A0E33
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x6BBE9A5C
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0xAC3F119F
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xBEAFF24C
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x40E8F51A
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x183D62D4
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0xED4FBDE2
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0xC03FFEC5
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0xB1CB0096

0xB04A0E33
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xAA8DFE06
she murmured.
0x306197C8

0xB04A0E33
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0xAF301F06
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x399104F0
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0xF8EBE6EB
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x61AB37DB
letter.  He entered.
0x0869148F

0xB04A0E33
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0xA0CBD178

0xB04A0E33
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0xFF2B16BE
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0xE3774C8D

0xB04A0E33
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0xC77ABC9E

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0x79599EFC
demanded, in a low voice.
0x5B93C138

0xB04A0E33
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x1CF681E8
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0x0E85807B

0xB04A0E33
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x749C0F5D
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xC1264E1C
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0xDBED87A1
enough.
0x86EA28A8

0xB04A0E33
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x2651E173

0xB04A0E33
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x32D2AA6C
Mary.
0xA7176A3B

0xB04A0E33
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x78D1EC30
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0xF7C40800
what _is_."
0xA786DB87

0xB04A0E33
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0xF827545E

0xB04A0E33
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0xD5E56F8E

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0xC99E7CDE
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x917574A0
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x92A18659
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x85E4CB60
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0xAB46B842
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0x28AB3EA7
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x0B136937
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x6E0B6F07
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xD9F6F6D9
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0xDCCFBD6D
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0x0E679D4C
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x4B48822A
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x1A62FA21
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x208D1660
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x64208673
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0xABE8820E
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x9FC69723
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x0370C35F
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x8E306744

0xB04A0E33
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x312983D4
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xAF12046B
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xEF5C32C8
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x5B9E2B2D
and so the old grange was abandoned.

CHAPTER XXXI
0x0AEE95A9

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0xDD0932D9
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x4E5DF63B
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x1F5CA08E
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x0839B0DA
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0xE09EBCA6
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x920C479F
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x2F3737D9
things as are necessary.
0xD226C023

0xB04A0E33
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x2BCF67E5
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x26786C41
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x4532DADA
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x27F4982A
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x68F51EDE
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x10E88D65
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xD3EC02A4
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x846E2F23
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0xE7C4668A
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x6ED456B7
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xD1B4C7D8
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0xB3A8FBB5
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0xCF701D13
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xCE3CD001
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0xA826FC74
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0xBD872397
on from day to day.
0x6BE61389

0xB04A0E33
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xC75DDAAB
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x249267AF
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0xE5A2EBD1
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x7FD5DA37
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0xCADCE0F3
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0xDA5BDAE2
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0x8603CB64
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x613598E5
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0xB06EEE2F
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x1FAE99C6
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0x39C09FE6
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0xBBCD6E50
gratification for disgust.
0xF633CDC8

0xB04A0E33
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xCC430E7B
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0x57098EDB
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x4D112577
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0xA16E4936
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x597BA42B
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xE8579585
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0xC17493B2
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x1389171C
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0x70B8898F
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x81CED09E
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x79BC6F7B
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x02A8A795
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0xE7DF24CB
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0x900D89B0
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x443EEE1B
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0xDC82BE0B

0xB04A0E33
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0xF581A3B7
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0x22E4D331
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x4E56A07B

0xB04A0E33
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0xB78EF3BA
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xA20FEF40
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x55ED794D
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0xDE0A4303

0xB04A0E33
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0xD4B9DF78

0xB04A0E33
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0xBFBDD469
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x8A5BD68D
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0x124ADD2E
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0xADCD09DD
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0xEFA514A3
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x2146E10C
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0xA18DAF5E
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xC26883C5
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x0F723A25
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x183E6097
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0xCEBDD90C
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0xF0B55F85
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0xC8070813
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x8D5C98C3
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x2847E6A7
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0xFBE83084

0xB04A0E33
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0xD043011B
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0x1B8AF0A9

0xB04A0E33
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x5B820612
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x4B44EEB3
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x4975DECB

0xB04A0E33
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x49E84A16
asked.
0xA5BD5458

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0xD9B1BD2D
scholars very well."
0xA515802A

0xB04A0E33
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0xB51D5190
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0xE57DB408
I interrupted--
0x6FA7BFAC

0xB04A0E33
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x1AD603BC
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0xAE89D333
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x829888EF
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0xB18EBA24
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0x20A34DF7
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x9320F84C
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0xA5A9737D

0xB04A0E33
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x564448C5
is dark and empty."
0xAE180E2A

0xB04A0E33
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x4B3F5372
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x8666B9E7

0xB04A0E33
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x4774A695
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x322FE84C
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x42A12BAE
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x76161865
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0xD1EA3BB1
steadily, for some months at least."
0x8C5E8CE6

0xB04A0E33
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0xD78EB318

0xB04A0E33
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x888F5139
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xB544931A
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0xBF28AFC8
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xCA3F64FA
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x09F995E1
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xA4A3C622
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x0E83488B
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x16ADD435
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x9D805C6D
rougher than it.
0x508B1BCF

0xB04A0E33
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x3DF1AE73
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xB379100B
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x9CD77BF8
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x1EBCF258
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x62C35578
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x4F47B699
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0x63FA3F81
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0xB78E904B
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x633CA23B
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x5D97BE6D
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xE503E669
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0xF992C541
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x23703FCB
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0xB193CE56
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0xA1D24C4A

0xB04A0E33
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x7474C168
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0xA09A8BF8
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x7AC1CAAA
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0xA0A8EB3D
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x9AB53B1B
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x54673ED7
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0xD605F841
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0x23794424
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x38647AC7

0xB04A0E33
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x821EEDF2
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x8203F35B
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x96918984
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x76CDE5F2
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xBDEBDDD3
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0xC58BA57A
exclaimed--
0xC083E190

0xB04A0E33
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0xE3F02D01
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0xB99DA3F9
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xFBCA4578
your back towards me now."
0xC8806E75

0xB04A0E33
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0xBDC02CB0
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0x9C1C359D
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0xF711D5A9
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x04229690
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0xD5C0E413
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0x8544B76B
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x72547BB0
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x10EA10F9
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x1AFF256A
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x7110AB31
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0xB3A41D8D
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0x841B4D65
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x35306AFC
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xAD15D502
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0xF7B24405
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x32AE1819
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x16FFCEB6
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x223A27B0
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x496B33C4
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x06382901
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x7C35B466
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0xBBFAE1F3
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0xCEBA31BB
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x74A6C679
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x3556C609
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x413AA215
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xB6A4CC1E

0xB04A0E33
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0xB71398D4
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x77822682
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0x5CE330A2
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x36C9DA08
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x257C3C60

0xB04A0E33
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x4D1DE402
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x540245EC

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xA1FA93B4
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0xFB0FE365
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x552757F0
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x299B6451
pointing to me.
0x7140F070

0xB04A0E33
"It is," said St. John.
0x895CAE9F

0xB04A0E33
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x88D99522
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x14E71BD6

0xB04A0E33
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0xA9236BFD

0xB04A0E33
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0x1526690C

0xB04A0E33
"Quite."
0x6D9B01BA

0xB04A0E33
"Do you like your house?"
0x07D5A865

0xB04A0E33
"Very much."
0xF9332B57

0xB04A0E33
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0x765EC116

0xB04A0E33
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x557C0674

0xB04A0E33
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0xB48C563E

0xB04A0E33
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x8B043A86
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x2DBD2E16
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x47615D96
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0x73B7C2AA

0xB04A0E33
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0x0522B28D
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0xEAD24170
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0xD8E2041F
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x36662EF1
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0x3E7A6C01
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x3C8B7C47
merchants to shame."
0xE42DF36A

0xB04A0E33
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x493D2A79
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x9FA9E235
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0x30AD2EC5
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xBE8540EB
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x5371147E
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x35EFBC71
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0xA1CEF113

0xB04A0E33
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x5330ADAE
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x63D7D859
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0x5A2EC491

0xB04A0E33
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x97435FBF
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0xC35C3300
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xD88F9410
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0xADD5A137
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0xBB43C766
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x04EE1623
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x2C9783F1
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0xA60FD076
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x5C651930

0xB04A0E33
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x23DB7BD7
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x08B00A9F
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x43D91A8D

0xB04A0E33
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x8AB6C286
John.
0x6E03A660

0xB04A0E33
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x558CF09F
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x81B744E8
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0x9D5E62DE
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xD042FEC6
her own.
0xF580830F

0xB04A0E33
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xC785F488
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0xBF1CDB4B
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x39FB0DE7
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0xED927F7E
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x0BEB55DB
papa."
0xED2FD1CD

0xB04A0E33
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0xAE0D5747

0xB04A0E33
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x347BCEE2
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x7A63C7E9

0xB04A0E33
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0x543E5DAE
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x5DE08611

0xB04A0E33
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0xFBA48AA6
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0xC856E444
returned.
0xA68DC67B

0xB04A0E33
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0xC5464C8C
blanched as her gown.
0xDB067F22

0xB04A0E33
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x9B6FE98C
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0xE2E6FFD8
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0xD135EC36
at all.
0xDFD98CB1

0xB04A0E33
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x0038606C
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0x10B08074
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xF50FAFC5

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x6565D8CB
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x73761C8B
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0x09A38E06
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xCBB84891
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x81B1DCEA
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x2EC71C66
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0x240CD3C6
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0xF9B7C8D8
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0xC550FB4A
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x33866DD4
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x6365BB1D
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x54549807
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x98DCD852
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x033936CC
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0x5564B71C
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0xDE1482D9
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0xC24FDAF5
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0xD3C35B8B
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x31BAFA0A
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0xD7CB4D2C
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0xC3B66703
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x90EFDDB7
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0xDA0BF0EC
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x3D869363
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0xBC3F5D0C
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0x8CA84830
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x56BB74B1
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xDE6567E9
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0x75209517
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x0F97CD2B

0xB04A0E33
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x26E219BA
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x946546A2
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0xEE730725
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x579B4997
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0x1C6D9A75
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0xCF6E782C
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xDA6F7709
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x6BE34BAC
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x961DAD71
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x47E4B456
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0xC0E8DECF
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x141C8FFE
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x5655D60D
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x0D1AE82F
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x665945A4
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x010F4BB1
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x4A210665
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x1E83DD54
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0xF7D2F0C9
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xB3462252
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x815F8791
duties of the day.
0x0A1656CB

0xB04A0E33
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xC0755DF5
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x7171C34D
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x0A25CCF5
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x98F11FFB
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0xA687EC89
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0x22873CFC
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x379666DF
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x201A09C5
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x91B498A3
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0x25FD2841
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x5734EEF2
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x9DBD2567
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0xE71195C3
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x03D9E413
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0xD80B3B48
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x7A33598E

0xB04A0E33
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x411B6CC7
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x39B782BC
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x1E2807B8
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0xB563ADD9
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x9B838680
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0xFD3716BC
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x71792812
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xE7B98C7B
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x4BE60CD2

0xB04A0E33
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0xD7261BC3
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0x20607073
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x4681B1CA
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xA257D588
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0xFB375016
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xF02585C5
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x09945859
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x2FFE5FC5
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0xD72FEC0C
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x79520C1B
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x3E052F2F
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0x0509C6B5

0xB04A0E33
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0xCCC7081E
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x3B7407B7
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xD3F941F1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xC3FA0E38
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x1DEB8D60
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x91CAD91B
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xC702D6A2
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x887A3A13
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x7A6C4CBD
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0xB06CBCEB
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x52712686
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0x12F79706
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x601A5B2E
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x6E03CC40
acquaintance.
0x3E57FE3E

0xB04A0E33
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x39DF9B82
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x105F8061
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x06B48963
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0xC1630A4F
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0xE146423E
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xBC5F921B

0xB04A0E33
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0xD4BCCE88
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x351EFC43
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x78FAC694
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0xE0768D90
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0x05400FD6
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x4E9AFD6E
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x765ADE8F
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0xD2804745

0xB04A0E33
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0xBFC76832
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x0370ED46
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x89471CE1

0xB04A0E33
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x0C9ECEE1
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0x0D4DEBA1
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0x767665DF
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x7C0961C3
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x4C02E384
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0x7024B03B
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0xD3EC75AF
day.
0x208FD2F5

0xB04A0E33
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xB479B152
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0x8792FE9E
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0x755E101E
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x96CBDBB7
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x76AACAB6
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0xD11EBC83
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x03EE3DCC
Hall.
0xF5828510

0xB04A0E33
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0x41013062
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x54118A05
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x699BAF98
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0x5A3FFD3D
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x0946119B
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0xE4DB2626
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0xD1190AD8

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xA3E1E15D
high family, papa."
0x6C256AF4

0xB04A0E33
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0xF24A4279
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xD0038CE1
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x75C3AEC7
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xDDFA0507
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xCBBAFAE1
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0xEE144C6D
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0x41C5B524
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x9397DDA9
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x0E92BA6C
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x842FC532
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0xF4C251BC
compensation for the want of fortune.
0x9A683CB7

0xB04A0E33
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xEFA57CDD
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0xE04C7C3E
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0xDF6A8872
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x645432AB
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0xAE701389

0xB04A0E33
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0xB78B5E56
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x2487E5BC
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x27AB872F
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x6B0DBC75
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x67E6C985
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x987E7E04
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0x0299DDD9
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0x5A36881D
Rivers.

0xB04A0E33
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0xA0C09251
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0xB340A7E2
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0x32560F56
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0x00B5B3E4
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x9E068993
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x7C2B3D37
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x8F39360C
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0xD9EC20AF
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0x27D1F1C1
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0xECF46365
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0xBF2D8307
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x9F72986F
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x416F11C0
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0x1ED6BF3D
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0x17813A25
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0x9D055D1B

0xB04A0E33
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x99CA99F5
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x2CD9A726
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xC99C1B0C
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x6C4B7CB0
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x69D74D3B
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xC8CA638C
him some good, if I could.
0xEEA7398F

0xB04A0E33
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xEB71DCCA
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x00973519
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0xDA2FAEFB
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x1DA6D110
him talk."
0x1329A235

0xB04A0E33
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x18DF548B
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x76241E5C
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0xAC1A2AE7
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0xF504F72C
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x57C01F72
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x91B0CAFE

0xB04A0E33
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0xCCC7D8D7

0xB04A0E33
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xFB4988A5

0xB04A0E33
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x8075C42F

0xB04A0E33
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x65E527ED
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xB693AD31
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0x816770E5
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0xFE8C0F8F
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xBF7F3DD1
rose and placed it in his hand.
0x443F70FC

0xB04A0E33
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x9C8F87B3
graceful and correct drawing."
0x7E3BD216

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x50A86FE7
like?"
0xE8D38D6C

0xB04A0E33
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0x8F17064D

0xB04A0E33
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0xB955E846
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0xB695012E
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x41B48BC6
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0xE47B11F0
deem worthless."
0x2605D16A

0xB04A0E33
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0x43E82F03
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x6E0E008C
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x323B54BF
smiles!"
0x31EAAC67

0xB04A0E33
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x943F78E7
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xBC82ED2B
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x41C03F38
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0xFCB4FAC9

0xB04A0E33
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0x6F274A88
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0xFD5FB474

0xB04A0E33
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0x89B5DF20
or wise is another question."
0x5CF99C05

0xB04A0E33
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0xE41429A9
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0x75CCF282
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0xDA5E9B23
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x2E5C5C37
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xCB2D2695
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x6013A952
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x65E4A5B3

0xB04A0E33
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x6176EBFA
take to yourself the original at once."
0xA6C0673A

0xB04A0E33
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x08D85A2C
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x45B83DE7
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x77665ADE
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x4F8791F3
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xCD593EC6
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0xA084A510
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0xC3C138E4
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x98CEAEB6
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0xB7714787
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x2EA8BE6B

0xB04A0E33
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x3E208839
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0x477CD08E
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x20052A67
ought to marry her."
0xC5E4F0EE

0xB04A0E33
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x6F6CB37A

0xB04A0E33
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0xC7E36890
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0xD712C311
often."
0x827AC4D3

0xB04A0E33
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x6D99DD24
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0x07938391
the table to measure the time.
0x7DFE9A5C

0xB04A0E33
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0xAAD7D3A0
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x8E18F097
fetter your heart?"
0x772E0110

0xB04A0E33
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x379FA80D
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x366E7B28
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x3359AE93
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x1EF70613
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0xDE619D97
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x9EFA94B8
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x65160A46
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0xEA8699BD
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x55362716
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0xE8B9C46B
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0xBB192D1D
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x0D262A75
time I marked pass in peace."
0xAED6ACAC

0xB04A0E33
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x0BA91AD9
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0x0E1CF0A0
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x59A7B261

0xB04A0E33
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xED717309
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x6DAFBA29
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x301FBEFF
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x6CF951BC
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x5445C1D2

0xB04A0E33
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x9DF45524

0xB04A0E33
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x6C00BCB0
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x625CA121
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0xC0D8C351
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x2BC6DC1A
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x13A63E30
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0xCEB5E245
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x2E695273

0xB04A0E33
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0xF0BF44F6

0xB04A0E33
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x6B65DA53
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x51A8879F
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xEB9DFD52
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x482EAC15
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x334FADFF

0xB04A0E33
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0x1E8662C1

0xB04A0E33
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x59251667
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0x90549E69
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x4D6A0220
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xC26B2942
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0xB304EDA8
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0xA9DC544B
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0x2F23B48A
live for."
0xF45A2A32

0xB04A0E33
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x74F5185B
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0xEA2C6018

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x7CB5107C
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x1F053176
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x9E541D52
should do."
0xF1D686F0

0xB04A0E33
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0x5B778D2B
wasting away."
0x609A93B1

0xB04A0E33
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0xFE7DBAB0
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x07F4F4C0
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0xDA45398A
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0x402A16BC
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x5A4FD655

0xB04A0E33
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0xD0B4964D
schoolroom."
0x1118CE6B

0xB04A0E33
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x203D0032
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0x10FC66FC
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x6112EFC1
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0xFF7B38A8
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0xE61EB412
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x8EA97F6E

0xB04A0E33
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x7A8D2020
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0x63048A6A
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xA6FDF14B
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x7E4EDABE
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x41049572
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x73175EE3
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0xA178D7A4
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0xFD6779EA
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x02CF948A

0xB04A0E33
I smiled incredulously.
0x5269ADE3

0xB04A0E33
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x521190BF
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0xE0753215
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x97D9A8BC
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0xC3D52865
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x878F8C65
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0xCB11A2F2
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0xC424543B
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0xA0B9A225
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x7211185E
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x3A9C0ADA
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0xDA38D81C
still suffer."
0xC67AF2D4

0xB04A0E33
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x5792957F

0xB04A0E33
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0xAADABF90
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0xDFB9001C
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0x36F5BA86
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x7E5F2205
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x4C91BFE5
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x7219D4BD
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0xABCC4357
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xCBFA8ED6
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x04A1A594
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x0F0352F4
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x0120AE07
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x6502D21C
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0xDA91C05E
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x0F638446

0xB04A0E33
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0xF473B6D6
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0xEED8AC34

0xB04A0E33
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x468FCB84
World, indeed!"
0x039D20C1

0xB04A0E33
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x4612FDA9

0xB04A0E33
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x820E3385

0xB04A0E33
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x1273CB54
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0xEB7BE766
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x24C65855
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0xEED5394C
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0xD5C9E335
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x9E6A0130
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x6E3DE0D2
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0xEED9D714
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x43B6BAC5

0xB04A0E33
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x9816B984

0xB04A0E33
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x8A2C94A0
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x7397781C
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0xB89B8694

0xB04A0E33
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0x7E53C654
globe, however!"
0xEACCD535

0xB04A0E33
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0xD7B7FF59
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x1AFB398D
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x417341CD
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x67A42278
forgot it.

CHAPTER XXXIII
0xCB58C025

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x9F34D1FB
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x57071B5C
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x0A4C2CF8
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x22C681EC
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x33873678
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xEF6B8590
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0xF96589D9

0xB04A0E33
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0x9E775C24
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0xBEBD25C9
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0xD3BB3849
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xFBA2417E
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0xA61E14EB
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x5C933CA3

0xB04A0E33
I soon forgot storm in music.
0xCDDC4949

0xB04A0E33
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x0DD4F7F8
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0x3415C14A
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0xAF561814
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x7445061B
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0x3A520E02
vale that night.
0x4A5B7F35

0xB04A0E33
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x1B6FDE30

0xB04A0E33
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0x09E7FF27
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x138D4854
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xADAB1DBE
boots.
0xF79D45DB

0xB04A0E33
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0xA294867D
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0xAFC91A40
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0xFB91EFA9
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xBB402608

0xB04A0E33
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0xFAD90A75

0xB04A0E33
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0x4151C4B5
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x9360D7D8
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x968F064C
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x9974B08D
impatient to hear the sequel."
0xD63CB60C

0xB04A0E33
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x45796497
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0xDFED2B55
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x5E1BDE7B
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0xAD3B4B48
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x397AE782
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0x1BC55B0A
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0xD104498D
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xC22899B6
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x25117262
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0x4FC1B70A
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x24495CBE

0xB04A0E33
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x748C7095
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xC891844C
health."
0xD663CCF3

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x0AAAB42D
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x916D30FF

0xB04A0E33
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0x7743CD11
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x45521C4C
silenced.
0x9D0A1CE6

0xB04A0E33
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x3856521F
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x7A8B6DB8
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x3A92E3A1
was behind him.
0xF7AD29EA

0xB04A0E33
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0x515BD1C5

0xB04A0E33
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x4C758A5D
alone now, and return to my book."
0xFD3D0B21

0xB04A0E33
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0xA0FC0A26
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0xF9678C3D
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x5F7578EF
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x92042FAD
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0xB64F60E7
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0xD0637E60
I would.
0xDBB94957

0xB04A0E33
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x45D05E10

0xB04A0E33
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0x777932E8

0xB04A0E33
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xA3D4A4CD
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xF66F0F6E

0xB04A0E33
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x78D23652
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x60518963
and my scholars.
0x13B8FFFC

0xB04A0E33
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x4453C992
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x30E7311C
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x81C609B6

0xB04A0E33
"Indeed!"
0xD85C8C0C

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x1D6E8B82

0xB04A0E33
"Does he?"
0x2A06A6CC

0xB04A0E33
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x1A4FE805

0xB04A0E33
"I know."
0xC6F84D51

0xB04A0E33
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x742BEB73

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Whose, then?"
0xECC426D1

0xB04A0E33
"His daughter's, I think."
0xFCDB4DF8

0xB04A0E33
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x6D3CD13D

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x3E353072
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x28ABDC55

0xB04A0E33
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0x08717218

0xB04A0E33
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xD3DB829C

0xB04A0E33
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0xB93D5FA4
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x485F52D1
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0xED7A5E38
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x01CA327D
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0xF31ACE9E
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x1853071F
trite or novel, it is short.
0xC49C77D4

0xB04A0E33
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x80DF4EE9
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x95BD7C31
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x087235C8
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x8D648ED0
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x3D8F51B5
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0x8920DCA2
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xF37F6B1E
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0x9A7704CB
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0x1FA9B79A
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0x7E848AC4
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xD86F4F01
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x1B9494C0
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xAFEDEF14
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0x865FCF28
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0xA99F71FF
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x136060C4
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x9F997434
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x49C7946C
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0xED0A1348
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x6B5D6D77
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x1B7233C8
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x62DC9A81
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0x2247C64A
Rochester."
0xEDA975AA

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x43C9BE96

0xB04A0E33
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0xBC5F4F83
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0xE7E86165
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xDB48277E
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0xD4E47869
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0x5A016CC0
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0xB580FF05
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xF76EB766
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0x68AC94D0
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x70CA8DEC
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x5121216D
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x2DA91034
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0xC3938753
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x3B382244
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x75D946FF
odd tale?"
0x4BDCBB1F

0xB04A0E33
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0xF6F9DCAB
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0xEB799D41
doing?  Is he well?"
0xEE8613A7

0xB04A0E33
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0xFC1E4763
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x043BC0CC
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xC83C0BF7
which requires her appearance."
0x44AB1997

0xB04A0E33
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0x745E5CC4

0xB04A0E33
"I suppose not."
0xF50534FE

0xB04A0E33
"But they wrote to him?"
0x2307D1ED

0xB04A0E33
"Of course."
0x19055049

0xB04A0E33
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x90AF3BD3

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0xD6E9F6A2
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0xAFF4691D

0xB04A0E33
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x8EFA11A3
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xA91D5933
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x579B13B8
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0x5285E003
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0xF1BFFC5B
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0x38760A73

0xB04A0E33
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x2A84C048

0xB04A0E33
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0x69AE425C
warmth.
0x69AD0B3B

0xB04A0E33
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0xBD00EEDD
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x7F1F6BDA
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x4B097082
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x5B3CFE55
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0x2C02B004

0xB04A0E33
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0xDA3713C5
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xF59513E4
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x5194D225
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x6EE27F06
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x1D9FB636
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x38FFF679
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0xA2B4601C

0xB04A0E33
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0xB0F730D3
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xE1B58653
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x690073CC
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x920E589F

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0xF38DD868
Rochester than you do."
0x33F96CD1

0xB04A0E33
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xC3D8970C
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x0E66657D
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0xD11FB917
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x15AC895D

0xB04A0E33
"Well, what did he want?"
0xAC84416A

0xB04A0E33
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0x3287447D
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0xBF928369
that--nothing more."
0xFC40FC68

0xB04A0E33
"I!--rich?"
0x70606413

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x6370EA05

0xB04A0E33
Silence succeeded.
0x5DE838ED

0xB04A0E33
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x2B794537
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0xD0E89FFB
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x5007C74A
will and the necessary documents."
0x9F74DFBF

0xB04A0E33
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0xDA3C01C4
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0xEFE5753B
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x4521896F
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x4FF8E96E
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0xA991FEEB
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x6E7972FC
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x81E8C0E4
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0x96841681
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x489408F4
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x45B68FFA

0xB04A0E33
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x32F7894F
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0x350873E4
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x9A8007A0
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0xAB39137C
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0x256F1C8C
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0xFF37FD97
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0xEF6AEB00

0xB04A0E33
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0xBC4B8C9F
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x02ED90BB
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x8AF2DEC9

0xB04A0E33
"How much am I worth?"
0xEB30DC12

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0xA21C8289
think they say--but what is that?"
0xD0399117

0xB04A0E33
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x3C64B911

0xB04A0E33
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x0D2E0D2E
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0xA74466F8
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0x5DFC9C6F

0xB04A0E33
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x472B0C58
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xE4F33191

0xB04A0E33
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xB8A3DDCD

0xB04A0E33
"No mistake at all."
0xCCDC1F65

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0xA393C49D

0xB04A0E33
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x1F40D7FD

0xB04A0E33
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0xCF4AB3EF
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0xC73201D4
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x37C0BCB0

0xB04A0E33
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0xD5C7AE11
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xAE69BE6F
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0xC882E08D
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0xC60E68F0
Good-night."
0x55235E04

0xB04A0E33
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0xFBD38971
minute!" I cried.
0x74B47590

0xB04A0E33
"Well?"
0x39D8D737

0xB04A0E33
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x02E0767B
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0xF41A7FB0
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0x9B86F667

0xB04A0E33
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0x6DC4B61C
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0x967B3426

0xB04A0E33
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0xE5088DCC
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x836C6A28
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0xE49CFE9C

0xB04A0E33
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x8A59BBCD
about it."
0xAF49F819

0xB04A0E33
"Another time."
0xC1DA3C11

0xB04A0E33
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x8FF36739
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x80892990

0xB04A0E33
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0x38D5816C

0xB04A0E33
"I would rather not just now."
0xF5497721

0xB04A0E33
"You shall!--you must!"
0x28269DE1

0xB04A0E33
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0x564C2075

0xB04A0E33
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0xF9E175B6
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x736EA58C

0xB04A0E33
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0x9AEC37F7
persuade."
0x534B1B0D

0xB04A0E33
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0xC5D1665B

0xB04A0E33
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0xC89E9CF0

0xB04A0E33
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x030B9B0B

0xB04A0E33
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x32EB3EC0
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0xDE1D549C
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0x6225F05F
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0x0A0B617D
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0xC7E8A288

0xB04A0E33
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0xE3093887
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0x4D1FD6D1
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0xBEDA3DAA

0xB04A0E33
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0xEFC93774

0xB04A0E33
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xBAE47FE8
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0x5DA24FE0

0xB04A0E33
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0x8C8FE2BC
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x97DE09B7
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0x9CE6D764

0xB04A0E33
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x75BF182F
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0xFCC80CC7
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x2E0ED5B5
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x106F132E
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0xC6AF9637
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0x8B9DAD6B
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0xA94C3A95
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x80487DB3
explanation.
0x59093974

0xB04A0E33
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0xA2C7B277
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0xD69BE38B
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0xED4F36A8
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0xF498E548
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x3CB199F8
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x0A21F11B
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x98CCACB6
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0xFD67942E
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x59AD3D8A
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x1F85B679
against the door.
0xCCDD6BB6

0xB04A0E33
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0x588C27AD
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0x49812C39
enough.  I resumed--
0xA957416E

0xB04A0E33
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0xBA271BE1

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x52357BAD

0xB04A0E33
He bowed.
0x185D4DA5

0xB04A0E33
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0xB33F2081
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0xB9C115DC

0xB04A0E33
"Undeniably."
0x67A430AD

0xB04A0E33
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x68529C41
the same source?"
0x76646DCC

0xB04A0E33
"We are cousins; yes."
0x07ECFFB8

0xB04A0E33
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0x807E358C
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0xF44D3DB1
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0xE4C01DB3
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0x00C7503C
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0xA7DAABD7
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x3DADFD68
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0x355657D4
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x63A3C65D
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0x959ADDE8
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0xF53DA912
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0xCE323447
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0xE39953DC
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0x0114D925

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x5C75932E

0xB04A0E33
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x84678E71
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0xFCAE8693
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x9DAF47F2

0xB04A0E33
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x3F1C7BA0
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0xCA5AAF68
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x95D746E7
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0xE68C07D4

0xB04A0E33
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0xC1818DA7
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x69DAFEE1
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0xD8A49B37
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0xCA1FB1A0
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0xFF55A2EF
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x36E0B138
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x78B82DE7
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xE238BF1C
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xEF7B5879
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xAAB31515
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x7CFD1603
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0xB5D07ABF
enjoyment.
0x0705C9D1

0xB04A0E33
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0xA9B4BD05
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x43F68161
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x6794AC63
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x3C3E75DA
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0x1FA6D1F6

0xB04A0E33
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0x22E1F6B1
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0xBEB2A36B
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0x03260417

0xB04A0E33
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0x3DD5A099
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0x0D7311FA

0xB04A0E33
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0xA094009A
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x25EC47F2
like an ordinary mortal?"
0xD88CA7EC

0xB04A0E33
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0xA819B694
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0xB00E8C57

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0xB10DC0C4
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0xC9C304F1

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0x8DFB69C9
comprehend better."
0x3CA415DE

0xB04A0E33
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0x2C28CE07
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0xEDD08989
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0xC4FFF39C
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0x61598804
fortune that has accrued to them."
0x3D8CDC20

0xB04A0E33
"To you, you mean."
0xBF67CB57

0xB04A0E33
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0x21A51615
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x4741BCB1
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0xD1B2410A
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x6C160558
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x990EC1EA
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0xA3423E3D
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0xCA97FF00
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0x99F0E8F6
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0x5AF2BA56
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0xEC96E0EE

0xB04A0E33
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x7EF07A92
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0x05F5DFA3

0xB04A0E33
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0xB5DD6CB8
the case?"
0x5CC890CE

0xB04A0E33
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0x3CCF7764
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0x3F545066
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x5C88589F
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0x8D046805
consider it absolutely your own."
0x9BA64B82

0xB04A0E33
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0xF362585F
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0x2BE7F295
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xD3FBFEC9
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x0E62FEA7
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0x83F133B9
myself lifelong friends."
0xB6C4F301

0xB04A0E33
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xCF0DC28D
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x6E8D1A4D
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0x22BCC0DC
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0xEE01B8E2
you: you cannot--"
0x5F893D19

0xB04A0E33
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0xEFA6AE34
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0xB614E6E5
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x613CD222
and own me, are you?"
0x7EA6A46D

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x33244548
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0xB2CF7B34

0xB04A0E33
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x82D63077
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0xD6B443E0
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0x2CB25A9B
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0xE9A519AE

0xB04A0E33
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x72E1C6BE
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x706D1F0D

0xB04A0E33
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x018E32A0

0xB04A0E33
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0x5468D05C
excitement under which you labour."
0xEABC5BA7

0xB04A0E33
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0x1A41A3C1
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x5493C286
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0x3841781B
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x5158267A
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0x5E7D8A3D
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0x36DB6FB4
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0x2B2E9B65

0xB04A0E33
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0xDD6AB69A
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0xE421D8B0
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xD48E2B2A
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x709B0D47
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0x1A3A1ED7
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0xB812853C
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0xC241AA53

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x5FF1C2C1
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x1D5B7CB5
scruple."
0xDC7DFEF9

0xB04A0E33
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x05E7483A

0xB04A0E33
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0xB18DFAFE

0xB04A0E33
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x8A881124

0xB04A0E33
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x1302C213
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0xBD26C530
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x90EB3C6D
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0xA3276CD8
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x0934193C
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0xDB1FC520
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x6AFD9FAD
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x2FB1703B
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0xBC589E05
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0xFF718821
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
0xCCD77F18

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXXIV
0x3039D9F0

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0xED80625C
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0xBBBF09A5
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0x171D7519
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x14AB887B
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xD45DBC7D
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x8447FD1A
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0x184ED3C1
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x7A3559EF
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x841FACE3
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x0802C998
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xF88FA2EB

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0xA1BB8CD0
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x68237EE9
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xCD08AFAB
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x1FA08A35
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0xAFC00FCA
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x20BA734C
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x6362CFA9
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x7DAC292D
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x6F7A7CAE
girls.
0xCCF58EA7

0xB04A0E33
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x969A85BF
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x85AC71B9
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0xFF1483D7

0xB04A0E33
"Doubtless."
0x8C1BCBD5

0xB04A0E33
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0x651B5360
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xBC322871

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x845EE590
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0xE39436CE
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x84DE8D63
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x59393AB1

0xB04A0E33
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x2FC488D9
What are you going to do?"
0xB16BD0AA

0xB04A0E33
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0xC112DFD3
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x720AA1E0

0xB04A0E33
"Do you want her?"
0x60876AA9

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x05BB8297
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0xACAEA255

0xB04A0E33
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0xE4F46AD0
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x4AE65608

0xB04A0E33
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x0131A639
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x777AA9F0

0xB04A0E33
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0xA3968A96
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x7C4C9D06
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0x4E60F5F8
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0xDDFE8582
now?"
0xBFFC5AF6

0xB04A0E33
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x13CAAEC2
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x6E6170CA
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x8F01FF2E
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0x9C92BE86
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0xDAB1B3F6
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0xF3E9B7DB
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xE0EB2AF7
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x1BDE5AFC
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x60F11C85
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x2F14DDF0
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x78C61790
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0xCFAF16FF
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x782C9EB3
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0x1FE44D8C

0xB04A0E33
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0xD9B5363F

0xB04A0E33
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x3218592B
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0x09D0B02A
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x1CD774CF

0xB04A0E33
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0xA861692D

0xB04A0E33
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0x45F516E3
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0xE8D573F6

0xB04A0E33
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0xA87E744A

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xA1A25D0F
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0xAB447DA5
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x1DFC4560
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x4B67215B
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0xC1390F67
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x0286050B

0xB04A0E33
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x86ABA05E
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x8E54B1C4
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x0BE9A5FF

0xB04A0E33
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x22D898C6
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0x495902B2
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x281FAC0F
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x1DCFEC33
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0xBEB0F095
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0x2E85FB1E
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0xBF4DF6C9
hear, Jane?"
0x8F430B61

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xFC9B1067
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x8BEAEB28

0xB04A0E33
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0xDDF59A9B
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x780B7DA3
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x999C08C6
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xCF1372FD
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xA26CD1F7
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x980535CA
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x99C25959
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0xF7BD8EBC
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x2FA803DA
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x91805180
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0xD24733BE
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0x36624E23
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0xA740740C
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0x0B648A50
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0x12BDAD39
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x82DB9AB1
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0xC42D6BAD
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0x25D51D0D
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x489ACC4D
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0x4828BE51
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x4BF5F6E0
without.
0x395E5922

0xB04A0E33
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x40CE25D7
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0xA6E0A85A
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xA14FBF11

0xB04A0E33
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x4F4E3AB4
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x90003187
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xC3489275
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0xBA9CB0BE
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0xA957FB9F
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0x271AB4D9
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0xC133F745
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x755DE16D
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0x1A484363
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x012F5428
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x36584E0E
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0xBBEC1227
improved aspect of his abode.
0x42FF9003

0xB04A0E33
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0x9F282E1C
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0x97F9B211
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x7ED5680C

0xB04A0E33
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x7DE27B65
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0xA933F37C
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0xEB35C987
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0x6625C52F
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0x35F5F721

0xB04A0E33
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0xA07BA361
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xB01B25AC

0xB04A0E33
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0xE97C42FA
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0x6351053D
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0xE81FA51B
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x13D5BA63
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x44032250
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0xFA85477E
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x7FF08E8C
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0xAC296804
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x107736C9
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x2994940C
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xE80C41D8
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0xC3BE9890
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x56124B74
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0xC70B64C2
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xFF60CF7A
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x671BC1B1
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x7EF09753
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x825FA30A

0xB04A0E33
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0xDD30F671
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0x122EAFDD
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x85507DA5
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x4FA625CA
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0x359F2C75
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x79F893CC
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x8E5E35FE
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x1B6B9F03
career--I see it now."
0x67F0B8FC

0xB04A0E33
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0xC14D33D7
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0xBDF6115A
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x68851DD4
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x51DA9DB4
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x8612C524
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xEAA37250
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x9C4C1E8E
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0xD26ABC2A
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0x52186979
into the house.
0x9D1B0DBF

0xB04A0E33
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0xEDBD1A14
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x82BC1F1D
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0x40A42A88
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x9C36BD13
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x63B2EDC0
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0x15CB6D6D
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0x6CBC6AD3
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0xA6135177

0xB04A0E33
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0x72AD7B24
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x1B206598
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xD26C0402
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x8A3FF93F
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x9DC0ED66
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0xC343C946
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0x674F9EDF

0xB04A0E33
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0x9AD9DA3E
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x1DDA9FBA
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0xB3FD1D07
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0xC4E2110D
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x2DEDB760
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x00670602
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x4FA2C005
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0x715856C4
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x5BB620B7
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0xA3F1E385
mother, who was drawing away."
0xEFFB2F16

0xB04A0E33
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xC713C434

0xB04A0E33
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x085D661A
the way."
0x03469DE2

0xB04A0E33
"Tell him I will go."
0x87EED351

0xB04A0E33
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x4A84CA32
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0x49BF5107
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0xE167FF65
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0xCF8502F1

0xB04A0E33
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0xAF344EB7
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x711F2B49
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x9822BCDC
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xAFEC4F9E
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0xE13E975D
with himself.
0xD9789249

0xB04A0E33
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0x9523C712
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x86291368
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x00F0B2BE
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0xCD0B392E
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x92268CA6
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0xB2E45794
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0xA34269E3
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0xBCC87D30
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xBA48BC68
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0x20897670
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0xAF4B137C

0xB04A0E33
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x626904C7
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x711823D1

0xB04A0E33
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x8F6FBAC6
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0xFE7C1720
ensuing year.
0x27F11C1F

0xB04A0E33
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x0A0342E5
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x6F4CB754
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0x4476D940
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x20C45B3B

0xB04A0E33
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x56D5F0B0
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0xB380A593
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x241BF98B
yesterday."
0x5ABF4C3D

0xB04A0E33
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0xC98F16D0
he was serene as glass.
0x62F35D21

0xB04A0E33
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0xEF10872C
known each other long."
0xAE8CB992

0xB04A0E33
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0xAA07BC98
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x224B05B9
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x6893562D
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x96483F86
can he refitted for their reception."
0x97D494CF

0xB04A0E33
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x37FD2750
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0xD8B4C68E
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x4D2248A9
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x8395B8DA
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x630103C4
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0xDE36DB50
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0xFE432D70
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x8FB2AA87
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0xA636ADA9
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x8EF1C961
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x13F269F7
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x47862408
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0xDB92A370
frigidity.
0x2A0641E8

0xB04A0E33
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x844F0E74
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x3DE7C16E

0xB04A0E33
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x1462872A

0xB04A0E33
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x7E2B64B3
moment's hesitation I answered--
0x3AD68E2C

0xB04A0E33
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x45D4D463
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0xA72FDD75

0xB04A0E33
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x566F0AB5
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x53A4B00D
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x530C2AC4
returned to his papers and his silence.
0xB2109CA4

0xB04A0E33
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xDD061254
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x70B127C1
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0xEAC7CC8E
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0xFD5D6824
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x93DFDCE5
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x170B8E2D
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x2FAE34EA
plans.
0x073715A5

0xB04A0E33
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x1EBC3C8F
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0x8A47A28B
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0xCA35B8B7
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x1CD27451
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x887271A0
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0xDC40A0EB
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0xF724A566
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xC7272146
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x94412C75
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x00075F11
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x19A3EAF5
the task without regard to the elements.
0x9B9CB79E

0xB04A0E33
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0x2AF0BBB4
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x07FE2D81
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x07761C01
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x8FB05056

0xB04A0E33
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x656B4A50
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0x69FCD2BE
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x0D7A272D
was a special annoyance.
0xA3AC4E1B

0xB04A0E33
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xE75099F7
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0xB97AF669
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x0EA5FF15
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x75A05C1D
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x73DAEAC0
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x98AD9164
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x940E21E8
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0xCED76EAB

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0x1214E134

0xB04A0E33
"Learning German."
0xF12ABEC8

0xB04A0E33
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x0AC9005C

0xB04A0E33
"You are not in earnest?"
0x649CC85F

0xB04A0E33
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0xF4EAA920

0xB04A0E33
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0xD8D87741
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x09D15FEA
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x9A517BFC
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x5FDF1B23
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0xB1F2FAEA
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0x23B309AF
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xE87268D4
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0xECF82FC3
barely three months to his departure.
0xB3CD32D5

0xB04A0E33
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x5A2343F0
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0xE8202EBE
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x38A522FC
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0xDDC2020C
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x30C4EDD9
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xDACD8F02

0xB04A0E33
"I know it."
0xCA8E3A84

0xB04A0E33
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0x17748E53
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x614E14EE
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0xFD1162F7
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x31900098
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x30C8E1CD
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0xF62FEDE9
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x643BB545
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x378E66FE
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x65F97C5C
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0xAF9F52DD
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0xBAA3D8F7
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x3DB4C012

0xB04A0E33
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0x78E20706
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0xDF818459
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x58F83C5E
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x984AF64F
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x87AE5A3B

0xB04A0E33
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0x7807D950
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x84C04C4E

0xB04A0E33
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x2BAD13BE
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0xA67667DC
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0xB316169F
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0xFA3A68D2
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0xD63C2AAB
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x8D1E43DE
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0xBF846800
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x42329347
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x6D242C65
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0xAB522276
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0xE892625E
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x1E24A56A

0xB04A0E33
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x65C1435A
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x60B20264
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0xF72DB773
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0xAEF83111
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x386E1890
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x6ADF4CF9
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x755CC63C
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0x866D16C7
own.
0xFA00335E

0xB04A0E33
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0xB69EE062
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x78F80EE9
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x6B96E443

0xB04A0E33
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x591C2D1F
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xCEDCB8A7
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0xA767A5B5
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x5B96F8F7
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0x1D963C66
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x491CB5AA
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x8A6D2E96
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x0E1D000E

0xB04A0E33
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x48AA80CA
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0xCAB06C63
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0xEAEDD84A
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x31427AE1
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x865AB80E
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0x3D9BE99E
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x2843E513
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xBB183768
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0xA8B78B7F

0xB04A0E33
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x9A74A682
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0x39795C11
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x21FC2437
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x487B50E1
then I felt dark indeed.
0x4D605482

0xB04A0E33
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x4E853348
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0xB0F28D94
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xEC9ECE64
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0xD7C5DAF0
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x15680F3C
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0xADEA7DB1
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x861BD7BB
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0xE4B1D1AF

0xB04A0E33
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0xCAB24374
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x8AB703A4
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0x9E98ADDD
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x81B9A67F
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x40D26590
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x3507FE13
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x440F4D4A
eyes filled again.
0x1A3A5EA0

0xB04A0E33
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0xD9B60D35
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xC755DEAC
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x77DAEA5A
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x68042353
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0xF3137FF8
as to its cause; he only said--
0xD7EEAF14

0xB04A0E33
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0xE0583554
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0xD543EC02
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0xB6D7723A
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0xFB5F0E1C
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0x35BE201F
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xA456EC24
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xEB096461
said--
0x873BFE59

0xB04A0E33
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xF4D4E5E8

0xB04A0E33
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x1C642635

0xB04A0E33
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x94A9CFD1
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0x5B742541
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x3C8900F0

0xB04A0E33
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x0DABDD5A
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0x3CD44150
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x26CEF9A4
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xE536E19E
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0x020B3551
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0x76C33EAB
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0xE85F45FC
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0x9E8908D6

0xB04A0E33
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x65FD1AB9
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x642754CB
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xFF7325E8
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0x1EDA26D6
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0xDD290C18
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0xCA6DE4F0
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0xB9D66420
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0xAA2A30F4

0xB04A0E33
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x5A8FCC1B
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x80DFA77A
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x978CC2A1
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0x7BC29A58
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x22734164
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0xEE96B097
last refuge for silence.
0x38A47B21

0xB04A0E33
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x40A2DB8B
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0xA6078D46
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x44E16A66
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x2BCF1B7A
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0x82B7E2F3

0xB04A0E33
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0xE0BBB0B9
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x9C004EF6
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0xC2F7E4BD

0xB04A0E33
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xA3AE88BC
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x60915CB5
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0xD0E274DF

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x354FBF2A
sails on the 20th of June."
0x16917A3C

0xB04A0E33
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x5CA6419A

0xB04A0E33
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x0414D968
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0xB16099F0
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x1673A7DE
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xA7CF4C9A
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0xBB1C8969
same enterprise."
0x1D22931E

0xB04A0E33
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0xBB2EF3EF
to march with the strong."
0x4C1A1C1C

0xB04A0E33
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0xD8E63D7A
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0x502366BA

0xB04A0E33
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0xB994B92F

0xB04A0E33
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0x74586D00
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x0B26FBA3
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0xA59D974E
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0xA6B3B25C

0xB04A0E33
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0xCDC31D71
the first to inform them of it?"
0xCFCFDE61

0xB04A0E33
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0x8B283E54
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0x8AFF14B8
rivet the spell.
0x85B03C91

0xB04A0E33
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0xFF55EC5B

0xB04A0E33
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0x73A63B95

0xB04A0E33
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0xCEF52B16
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0xCB103888

0xB04A0E33
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0x30C18562
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x8C03E964
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x094F2979
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x86C8D228

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0xC5A322EA

0xB04A0E33
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x459CFB4C
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0xCCF21279

0xB04A0E33
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x5AE1BFEB
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0x128D77B8
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x7C7A3CE0
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0x7BC1FC55
service."
0x3A499030

0xB04A0E33
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0xB9A9C24F

0xB04A0E33
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0xA6E81512
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0xB0E9714E
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0xAFABCBE3
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x6706C2FD
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x085B18AD
for him.
0x46C51D37

0xB04A0E33
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0xB0ED6FA2
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x1B1D2892
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0xF64B1389
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x79615A1E
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x60C8BB1B
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x10F5D05C
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0xC845CB2D
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x450DE9E7
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0xF92E9A29
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0x27BE932A
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0x7F1F6302

0xB04A0E33
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0xDF6626D9
labours."
0xABE0B581

0xB04A0E33
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0x19C4D88F
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x86369616
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0xDEFD24F9
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0x88E91306

0xB04A0E33
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0x310975FD
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0xE1B16A83
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0xDABCD9EC
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0x3A7D69E0
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0xD4148508
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0x8BAAEB12

0xB04A0E33
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0x7430A58E
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x8162FAB7
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x6C99B09E
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x37776E80
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0xCB6855B5
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x394012C6
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0xEFC635AD
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x1C981A63
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x27FB0AE9
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x85BF1CFD
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0x604596C9
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x63D4F9F2
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0xA9F9C918
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0x4717C8D3
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0xE3A25551
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xE9372F42
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xB6969467
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0xF1303270
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x453421E7
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0x6985936A
be to me invaluable."
0x869545A0

0xB04A0E33
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0xA963879A
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x4E8BA857
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0xB63533D2
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0x56D4B512
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0x846F8C2B
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x17A9A279
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0x2725A557

0xB04A0E33
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0x07B87AA1
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0xC4402CB2

0xB04A0E33
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:

0x3814DDAB

0xB04A0E33
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x55DDA45C
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0xF468D07E
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0xA0E2E4BB
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0xE6768B67
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0xE59F77F6
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0xDBEB3A7B
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0x122FC1F2
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x8B3A19E1
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0xCD1F76EE
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x406CD5B7
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0xF7B755FD
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0x887D9EFE
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x26041FA6
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0xAFB0560E
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xBFB5DED5
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0xF1496BB8
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0xEE037C08
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0xD97B21E5
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x340FEA43
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x43EF8675
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x07AFB6FF
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x13079675
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xF4044569
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x9734754F
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x871CCDF8
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0xD3B9D374

0xB04A0E33
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0xDEB8F122
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0xC8C02A95
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0xB7C7F11A
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x5C29A16F
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x77453980
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x64EB7ACB
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xDFCF7009
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0x90478836
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xFF1F667D
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0xB4797300
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x282398F5
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0x924B5EDE
I will tell him so."
0x43C7BB94

0xB04A0E33
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x068851AD
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x2993BF0E
his feet and approached me.
0x5F669DDE

0xB04A0E33
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0xC9A1A440

0xB04A0E33
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0x68796491

0xB04A0E33
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0x30F7C233
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x1142E41A

0xB04A0E33
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x6EBF9788
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0xCCE7E736
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x0D95DF21
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x2BD62AAF
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0xFF01C005
sense will guide you."
0x7800DB46

0xB04A0E33
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0x70F245F7
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x2962165B
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xD3273975
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0xBE1213BE
continue."
0x3E2715EA

0xB04A0E33
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0xD2B6FD84
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0xB606AD88
have said that."
0x75EC8923

0xB04A0E33
"Conditionally."
0x10CC8889

0xB04A0E33
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0xEC5FE0B4
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0x2CFFE489
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0x1ADE237F
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0x9BB76A49
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x82B4E079
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0xA85DC4E0
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x845EEF46
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x2BAAA133
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x61C453E0
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0xDE8B1A89
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0xD5913E83

0xB04A0E33
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x83E5DD89
my limbs.
0x5C55AF4C

0xB04A0E33
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0x0841E345

0xB04A0E33
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0x87BF96B9
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0xD96071D3
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0xA230DFE8

0xB04A0E33
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0x618B5807
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0x243E5046
them he has no use: I retain them."
0xBE1D1D98

0xB04A0E33
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0xEC2B2F03
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0xBC9B06DD
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x7072BCAB
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0xB8BE9AF8

0xB04A0E33
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0x16F76330

0xB04A0E33
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0x125C86AE
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0xE96AE47E
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x80556B17
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x07E5A026
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x4100D85A
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x6FB1363B
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0xD88357A3
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0xD5DAE5B0
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x083BFBE5
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x67185716
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0x34E758E1
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0xC518CBA2
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0x74A169BE

0xB04A0E33
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x79058242
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0xEBA869E9

0xB04A0E33
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x02A4B36F
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0xB3097905
this signify?"
0xEA69FD7E

0xB04A0E33
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xF5A4C2B2
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x5CDD49C4
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0xAED5796B
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x5C24C25B
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0xFA4E60B1
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0xAF4BF20E
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x37695B65
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x926D18F6
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0x6A4AF04C
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x520ACC82
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x49ABF83A
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0x0F05650D
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0x55F6491B

0xB04A0E33
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x3EF6CBD6
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x8CA395CF
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0x28470736
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x9A968AE6
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0xF2458971
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x3E2FDD99
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x98D38132
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x6D7D73BD
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x2AEE01DF
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x72AEA057
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x2A65D5C0
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0x3C4E47CF
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0xB4B44A11
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x6D9E99D2
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0xF999B2A2
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0xA6279338
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x7D42A6D8
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x025221C0
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0xEE31862E
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x7D4C4C69
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x75C321E8
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0xA82F3151

0xB04A0E33
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x57055308

0xB04A0E33
"Well?" he answered icily.
0xE2D3940E

0xB04A0E33
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x01482F3B
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0xECBE9A67

0xB04A0E33
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xC4812EF6
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x8AD2CA03
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x7CFD30F2
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0xA161DD6D
tribes--and unwed?"
0x1BFDA4BF

0xB04A0E33
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0x06E1942C
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x0BF371D3
yourself."
0xAD25C075

0xB04A0E33
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x7E3C0B97
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0xE551EDD1
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0xA697DE90
heart and--it would not do."
0x9378100E

0xB04A0E33
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0x0324532A
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0xA85A21E8
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0xEC4E61AA
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x870B8E8E
nothing more--don't fear."
0xB364E796

0xB04A0E33
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x63E6372F
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x00DAFF32
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x58A72288
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0xC0B091E1
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0x75E72F9F
eyes."
0xC876A1DB

0xB04A0E33
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x8635EDEA
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x9ED4D5DA
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0xFB6639A2
offer it."
0xDA7CA7F0

0xB04A0E33
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x6CC2DAA2
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x48A6C042
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0x1A110A16

0xB04A0E33
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x9AEAA972
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x7C9834BE

0xB04A0E33
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x17401D2B

0xB04A0E33
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0xB9D4AAF5
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x27F2BFDE
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xF43C2AC7
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x2628C60E
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x7CDD4696
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x0A86D048

0xB04A0E33
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0xD470292B
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x60E7B21B
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0xDB404093
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0x0255A033
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x2FF9B923
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0xB67CAFB6
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x0D94021E
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xF0EB619C
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0x003D8B1A
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xA3D4A4A4

0xB04A0E33
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0xBC5CB5BA

0xB04A0E33
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x6057636B

0xB04A0E33
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x97A7AAED
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xF117D4A3
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x76C9D818
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x5FB5B45A
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0x6060651D
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xB6D8B6E9
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x57797C20
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x7A7CC258
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0x1342E905

0xB04A0E33
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0xC8B0E777
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x0FD1AE32
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0xBC87FCAE
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0x90F46611

0xB04A0E33
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x8E00945E
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x7C71B453
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xEE7D11F7

0xB04A0E33
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0x278113CA
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0xFF98C90A
stairs.
0x90740083

0xB04A0E33
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0xD56749EC

0xB04A0E33
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x2C7D2BDC

0xB04A0E33
"Then shake hands," I added.
0xAE93952D

0xB04A0E33
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0xBCA6AC1D
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x37380D5B
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x678F5D4E
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0xD0BC78D3
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xF151BF2F
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0xC365F3E4
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x639E0F71

0xB04A0E33
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0xB5ECB700
down.
0x59A66931

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXXV
0x08CE47C8

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xA196A29B
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0xF9103DF3
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x838011B1
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x6C207321
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x1A9590C3
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0xE7DF182D

0xB04A0E33
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0x2DC985D5
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0x4321D7F8
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x5B0D0B2E
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0xAC30B906
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x69A35702
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x25FE9BEE
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x1CBB9327
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0xAFD9736F
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0xB78C6A5D

0xB04A0E33
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x4ED3290E
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x12678F38
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0xF542E985
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x5884C06D
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0x30670E5C
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x96085DDF
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x4D8ED937
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0xC2DEABED
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0xA60A641B

0xB04A0E33
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x8E3751A3
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xF0E2E48F
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0xDB387F17
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0xECC832E6
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x2826407E
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x8ADA1C99
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x5594A177
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0xDECCA8B5
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x74A34F0A
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x409619CF
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x737F3EC5
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x2EE08DE7
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x56E09B83
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x46CFF5A1
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x5C75BD85

0xB04A0E33
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x40E7D6C4
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0xD547A59B
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x6C9AA271
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0xB5808336
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x4F0E5C6E
spoke to the point at once.
0x1E99196D

0xB04A0E33
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0xC135BAE4
friends."
0x44D6184C

0xB04A0E33
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0x56F80091
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x70D17ABD

0xB04A0E33
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x820B7FBB

0xB04A0E33
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x0D45717E
good."
0x6886D534

0xB04A0E33
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0x2A123CD1
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x0B6C2089
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0xD4856445
strangers."
0xC7670A91

0xB04A0E33
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x2E68C962
regarding you as a stranger."
0xBF01273B

0xB04A0E33
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x245BAE9F
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x4028A30E
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x26D2C40F
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0xD31C507F
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x21DC23BF
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0xA90D8473

0xB04A0E33
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x23D79873
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0xD888E8C3

0xB04A0E33
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0xEE80C81F

0xB04A0E33
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0xBB0E055F
India?"
0x4A59C384

0xB04A0E33
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xCD733EB0

0xB04A0E33
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0xAF78329F

0xB04A0E33
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x239E9CAE
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x872C9F52
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0xEE59D7BD

0xB04A0E33
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0xF0442134

0xB04A0E33
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x4952396E
crash down.
0x1F491BD9

0xB04A0E33
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x373AA294

0xB04A0E33
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0xE99EF353
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xBD191393
You are killing me now."
0xEFFC8AA3

0xB04A0E33
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x701116CA

0xB04A0E33
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0x02C60B2A
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x871A9CBD
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0x75D0B676
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0xFD2AFE64
until seventy-and-seven times."
0x2AEBB831

0xB04A0E33
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x522BA9AA
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x4D808F72
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0xC3E196AF

0xB04A0E33
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xEFF39965
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x46944B32

0xB04A0E33
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0x6024A5C8
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xC39EFCA3
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0xCD1D24AA

0xB04A0E33
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0xA9358F4B
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0xA27E32A8

0xB04A0E33
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x6CCBA544
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x909A9921
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xE17C1B35

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0xF3D7319A

0xB04A0E33
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0xE4FE29A0
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x7FFF0481
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0xA66BC9A4
spoke at last.
0x6854CFDF

0xB04A0E33
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0x6F82C247
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x712A3B6E
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0xB09E1D7D
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x2378C329
sake."
0x51C9E659

0xB04A0E33
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0xB4491F87
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0xF5460AD0
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0xAA24A1FE
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x757BDE72
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x99C4B3EA
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x2CCAA909

0xB04A0E33
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x024A4311
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x2B759FB9

0xB04A0E33
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0xEC191865
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0xE000FCDB
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x8D814D2A
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0x7A374311
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0xDC7CBDE2
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0xD28C5C3C

0xB04A0E33
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0x62B6313C
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x275B8365
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0x43622D4A

0xB04A0E33
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0xDE80545A
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x6943D09B
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x592CF68A
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x9A9BE3A3
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xACB90031

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x7B43896A

0xB04A0E33
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x9E0B6FC1
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0xC2FAF3AA
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x39A452E6
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0x065ADDC8
leaving it."
0x17A11109

0xB04A0E33
"What do you mean?"
0x9CCD3A90

0xB04A0E33
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x25041F74
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x3B65DEC8
some means that doubt is removed."
0x81A0FE42

0xB04A0E33
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x41897CD4
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0x21EA4A03
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0xB8D9758D
Rochester?"
0xD3F983DA

0xB04A0E33
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xAA367E9F

0xB04A0E33
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x3B59814A

0xB04A0E33
"I must find out what is become of him."
0xB6F79707

0xB04A0E33
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0xAC7BBE39
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0x5AEB1FA9
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0xAE15E6D6
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0x9827B6A7

0xB04A0E33
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xE2BE888E
was soon out of sight.
0x7CD3303C

0xB04A0E33
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xE22A533F
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x10C697E7
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x6E58BB76

0xB04A0E33
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0xE6292A5F
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x87ACADB5
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x342FEF8F
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x6F0211DE
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x31C0BF13

0xB04A0E33
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xC4D9DAF4

0xB04A0E33
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x72BA2E23
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x4794AD57
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0x4305B495
Jane?"
0x2C36C3D6

0xB04A0E33
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x65CFF11F

0xB04A0E33
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0xAB805E3D
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0x6B386D2F
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x6CB294AF

0xB04A0E33
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x4BF1A239

0xB04A0E33
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0x2CF6BB0F
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x3D79342A

0xB04A0E33
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0xF4F06093
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0xF0E1DDDA

0xB04A0E33
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x74DAF9BC

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x895BC388
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x450940C5

0xB04A0E33
"I have refused to marry him--"
0xB40203D5

0xB04A0E33
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0xB1551C75

0xB04A0E33
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x3D6038CB
as his sister."
0x9B52F08C

0xB04A0E33
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0xA3DEF727
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0xB9790C09
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xA67ACB4D
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0x29A70A3B
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x0BA7BA27
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x3952C50A
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x7EEAF0A7

0xB04A0E33
"Not as a husband."
0xA1239827

0xB04A0E33
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0xB6CF1EB7

0xB04A0E33
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x39B019A3

0xB04A0E33
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x255D66BC
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0x5CA31DEE
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0xED14C931

0xB04A0E33
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0x31DE2073
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x7F83AC11
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x97409722
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x898D1E4A
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0x447EE8C2

0xB04A0E33
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0x9C8199D3

0xB04A0E33
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x03F231C4
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x3402C7FA
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0xB2A4EEE1
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x209437E3
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0xFF3FEC9F
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x2ED1B469

0xB04A0E33
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0x2D9C3DC7

0xB04A0E33
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0xA85B5C3A
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0xDAD226E2
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x045ABA83
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x2A2732C0
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x368E735D
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0xEC40413B
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xD5985BA1
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x5E9C12A9

0xB04A0E33
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x9B82D414

0xB04A0E33
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0xD0FFE58D
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0x4D6B351A
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x047C3CFA
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0xA24109C9
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x149C9EDF

0xB04A0E33
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0xA516D5A7
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x88C0667E
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0xAB1C7EFB
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0xBBF04F46
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0xC243AAA4
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0x4514AFB2
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x4B4E717A
had forgiven me once more.
0x6A8DD5DD

0xB04A0E33
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x06BA6144
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0xA27902D4
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x476A6725
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0xFF007479
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x311CB800
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0xDD9A8E69
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x1E707ED9
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x0E3D52B3
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x7D3F4ACC
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xFE239A17
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x518BB1DB
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x7573277A
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0xF6560E39
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x92A665F3

0xB04A0E33
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x4B941AD1
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0xE1A30F36
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x49D0DD32

0xB04A0E33
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x3BC06E8E
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0xFB8DE631
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x4FEA25A8
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0xC88F27C0

0xB04A0E33
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0xED46E481

0xB04A0E33
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xE7F314B8
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x638A196F
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x0E35EB14
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0x63BFC96A
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0xEA7CA087
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x7BBCEBC0
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xFED5BB9F

0xB04A0E33
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0xF611EFAD
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0xF8732C8E
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x8C90E672
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x917DCFB5
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x75B54CD1
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x19CB1F12
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x8CB2F709
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0xDC8847A2
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x92709CA2
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x52D0BAFB
could not but feel it too.
0xA618E1E4

0xB04A0E33
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x8B0B2477
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x6D5D79FF
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0xE74E2B08
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0x7E3E1FD8

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x201700D1
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x03E0D340
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0xC220B055
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x604B0F2E
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x943C387C
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x7A709CA4
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x0204FF17
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x50D255AB
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x9AFCFC60
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0x2E244FBB
from you!"
0xDBF924CC

0xB04A0E33
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0x8002C0F0
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x457BF4FD
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0xFE0D59F2
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0xF5F9D5BA
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0xBE45DBA8
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x74E0D625
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xE64E5FFD
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x28C06721
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x497F7F02
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x52206DBF
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0x6495FAB8
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x218CAC89
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x58653784
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x70F6BFE9
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x2F9B052E
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x82B9833C

0xB04A0E33
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0x75B37B16
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0xEFF8B746
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0xF1E5A0E8
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x96A50A5B
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x234C42BC
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xE5981D61
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x57162FFF
dim room was full of visions.
0x4A69C82D

0xB04A0E33
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x91812473
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0x9F4ADB77
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0xEA864D5A
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0x043C2EEB
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0xBFDB1F16
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xB54BC183
prayer: it was only elevated.
0x800055AE

0xB04A0E33
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0x7A015ABE
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x277B54A5
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xD898EB59

0xB04A0E33
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0xD1A8FCC1
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0xB6170AA1
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x6C162A54
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x5C0B9B6F
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x8039A8E0
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x0B2CF843
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0xF1E8BBA3
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x78DDB179
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x0D265C61
shall judge.
0xD1F6B82F

0xB04A0E33
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x6CCAE792
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x84B462F5
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xD304CC77
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0xB6F80AF7
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0xC8D34E91
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0xA20F2D36
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x02AC5404
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0xC4DD4E52
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x69524B62
bones.
0xC90D94DD

0xB04A0E33
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x6428F5C0
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x2E10E856

0xB04A0E33
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x62059345

0xB04A0E33
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0xB9DFC6BB

0xB04A0E33
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x44778447
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x870E1FA3
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x3B85E698
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xC1D570A1
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x22C6E439
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x33A32133

0xB04A0E33
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0xD9A67536
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x168D4D15
garden: it was void.
0x06A3FBF8

0xB04A0E33
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0xEF05175B

0xB04A0E33
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0xD8876AAD
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0x0D006D46
loneliness and midnight hush.
0xD43DD07D

0xB04A0E33
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0x0EE46645
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0x4120A776
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0xD3215EDC
best."
0xD754633D

0xB04A0E33
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0x4C12CB71
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0xECEE7EA7
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x643E2775
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0xF6D2BC7D
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x52AE66D9
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0x786DBB64
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0x664A70DA
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0x2BCAAA7F
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x43D23D84
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

CHAPTER XXXVI
0x166E4EDB

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0xE7F5B231
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0xB360F2B6
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x930CCB28
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0xAF4CDC0A
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0xFF6DDA07
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x500B09E8

0xB04A0E33
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x3FBDC806
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0x662CE023
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x08DCCFCA
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x2F8402A5
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x53287613
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x37A8AB38

0xB04A0E33
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0xC242482E
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0xD4F506FF
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0x718A3BB9
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x2D8EFAF3
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0x0392039B

0xB04A0E33
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xA5A5B010
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x8CBD3109
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0xC8BFB369
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0xA0913BBF
would meet the coach.
0xA02DFF4C

0xB04A0E33
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x52906B96
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xAB226544
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0xA090E2E4

0xB04A0E33
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x993D98EB
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x64C14660
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0x7A2B8D64
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0xFBD2E7E7
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x9A0F69C4
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x4BAB2E4B
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x59F56F6E
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x8433BDC9
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0x30F1AC78
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0xB87E3145
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x5175D050
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0xB36907AA
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x6CB4D329
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0xEC5A6F14
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x285847CB
body.
0xB15B2F8F

0xB04A0E33
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x2505D21F
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x359B3BB4
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x137CFC66

0xB04A0E33
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x91DCC9CA
and should be absent at least four days.
0x1C9EB07D

0xB04A0E33
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0xD180E565

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x4D3C738C
time been uneasy."
0xC6AB4934

0xB04A0E33
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x7BCBECF2
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0xDA8347C4
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x6BC4F262
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0x05A1F391
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0x47CC993E
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0xBC653724

0xB04A0E33
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0xE45E4E2C
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0xD431D361
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x76E42969
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x88FB83A7
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x42BD7C4A

0xB04A0E33
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x17595D76
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0xBFB84885
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x8C39C196
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x76F31897
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0x1937989E
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0xE5AF5055
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x88F18307
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x6DF06695
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x2995C26F

0xB04A0E33
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0x177AE966
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x1CBBE51B
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0x0D32F24D
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0xB053445A
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xAB4575DB
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x2C1D34FF
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x770BBD6E
we were near my bourne.
0x2CEAE15C

0xB04A0E33
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xB272172C

0xB04A0E33
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x5152AC33

0xB04A0E33
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x3853C4CD
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x9C3DD370
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0xE20A8F47
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x92B334F8
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0xE9D42F75
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0x372C574D

0xB04A0E33
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x7C158BDD
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0x07CDE4AC
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x0A796E10
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x5E7C9FAD
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0xF56162EB
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0x4B7F1506
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0x0575A6C7
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x9EB5E590

0xB04A0E33
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x07B1BD05
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xC4F82AB1
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x80B3662C
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xD941A9BE
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0xCE502904
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xC9F6626A
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x8B768AC7
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x3EC012C6
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0xA7E0339E
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x5A077C65
them!
0x073F805B

0xB04A0E33
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x951376C5
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x92B1B1C1
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x868E990C
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x62771C38
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xE6BFECCA
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x38C86B8E
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x5619575F
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x75FDB2CF
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x9776EF8A
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x62573268
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x6D07B93B
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x480232AE
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0xF657AA04
tideless sea of the south."
0x55E4532E

0xB04A0E33
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x6FAC668C
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x0A12520B
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x479F70B5
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0xD114FB76
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0xB33B295E
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x79CDD062
station were at my command.
0x14386708

0xB04A0E33
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0x5CD60E4E
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0xC1D73DE3
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x73BDDF18
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0xB006E70A
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0xB7194EDD
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xB37A54CB
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0xFC403115
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x490F9911

0xB04A0E33
Hear an illustration, reader.
0xAF13071A

0xB04A0E33
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0xADD7D053
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0xEFE70BB1
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x4E07AFFF
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xC1BC828B
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0x29B3014B
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0xAB308F05
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x4F102DA2
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x2C3E32B0
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x1DA6782E
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0xEA535E02
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x13873E1F
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x506E7AAA
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x58D30C67

0xB04A0E33
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xB27D79AD
ruin.
0x0C93703A

0xB04A0E33
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x3AAF8B23
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0xA6E60FD8
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x0C7A3331
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x63E02AA8
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0xAD3CE126
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0xBBB4FFA7
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0xCF056B10

0xB04A0E33
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0xB49FDE93
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x4EC61778
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0xFC29755E
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0xEFFCBFD7
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0x552821AD
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x99D0E0E3
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0x5344AE30
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x001DDBB6
token.
0x7C524074

0xB04A0E33
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0xCFB86492
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x14EBBAA6
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x2A15175A
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x4C2D5AF1
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0xF44BDCC5
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x5C8CA2D4
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x79344F00
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0xBB882258
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x7DBF40A8
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x5BBC9634

0xB04A0E33
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x0E7B6159
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x6BD836B4
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0xF98074DE
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0xB2EA094B
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x77DDDA69
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0xBA38DAD6
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x103A5F69

0xB04A0E33
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0xF2D52A16

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0xC49434E5

0xB04A0E33
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0x6D02F42F

0xB04A0E33
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0x2642B741

0xB04A0E33
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0xF87910D6
trying to evade.
0xEF918E16

0xB04A0E33
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0xADCC0DB4

0xB04A0E33
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0x5F0C13F7
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0xD01AB94C
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0x5ECD608B
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0xB3DC690D
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x48F5B421
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0x57A5BD7F
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0x47E5915F
Antipodes.
0x2F68E54E

0xB04A0E33
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x686B745A
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x240516E8
direct question as to where he really was.
0x9446F10F

0xB04A0E33
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0xE7C42636
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x60EC4074
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x47B5BC92
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0x4B0B5BB9
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0x4D2927AE
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0x84379620
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0xE48C1593
witnessed it myself."
0x82027CBB

0xB04A0E33
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x422F9882
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x36A90F03

0xB04A0E33
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x1F829B12
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x1E5CC949
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x295613D9
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0x75C0F0C8

0xB04A0E33
"I have heard something of it."
0xF79DBBC9

0xB04A0E33
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0xCE39ED4D
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x261D8513
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0x8F59D297
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0xCD1E0A71
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xD8B98FD2
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0xF886A298

0xB04A0E33
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0xF51CB240
main fact.
0x62FF7DD4

0xB04A0E33
"And this lady?"
0x7C989254

0xB04A0E33
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0x8C4F0DAC
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xB66212D3
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x1EB436F5

0xB04A0E33
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x3A886AC7

0xB04A0E33
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0xB3E1B774
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x575FA9C5
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0x1686B206
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xBC5E21A1
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x8AD4FAF7
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x90DF2E7A
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x753D3598
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x44F467D4
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xAA9C21AF
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x11460A1E

0xB04A0E33
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xFFA9007D
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0xA84824C4
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xEBA947CA

0xB04A0E33
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x01B3796B
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0xA9F0E1D5
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0x498E6CEB
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x47E9D9C1
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x662DD9BD
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0xBD485ECC
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0xED756A4D
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x5644871B
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0xBE9289E6
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x0614BCE9
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xFE36C344
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xEC00A380
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x8997BF40
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0xDFABE495
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0xC03AD76A
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x4C8E7CEC
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0xE6FA19A2
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0xCDE8B6D6
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x7965ACFE
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0xDEEC3491
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x25F617BD
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x0572F4B3
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x5C51FBEE
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0xE3C6C02A
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xB0953964
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0x19255E6D

0xB04A0E33
"What! did he not leave England?"
0xC468EC5E

0xB04A0E33
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x285D1575
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xCBCE75E3
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x181B04C1
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0xD082EFE3
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x5F859728
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x01696198
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x4F1F7CDB
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x9A657BAA
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xE1E43207
Thornfield Hall."
0xC8775F3F

0xB04A0E33
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xC204F7B2

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x5F1128F8
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x2C84BDA0
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xF667CF5F
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x03EBD225
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x4814C3A5
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0xE388CF8D
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x75AA05D3
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0x8A033B3D
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0xBA7041B6
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x9A896216
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x83D4730F
pavement."
0xE20102F3

0xB04A0E33
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0x0870BFB4

0xB04A0E33
"Dead?"
0xA2ABD68F

0xB04A0E33
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x7905A379
scattered."
0xAAF22351

0xB04A0E33
"Good God!"
0x29DAB4F0

0xB04A0E33
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0x2FF32313

0xB04A0E33
He shuddered.
0x4A4AD90C

0xB04A0E33
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0xCE32ACAF

0xB04A0E33
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0x7759C644
only some bits of walls standing now."
0x9B13CDFA

0xB04A0E33
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x40745096

0xB04A0E33
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0xADD8ED1E

0xB04A0E33
"What do you mean?"
0x9CCD3A90

0xB04A0E33
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0x2C5557A8
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0xFB520403
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x40BF76D8
pity him, for my part."
0x6C870F2D

0xB04A0E33
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0x44BA12D9

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x75CAABBB

0xB04A0E33
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0x443E8023
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x71150083

0xB04A0E33
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0x66A88429
fixture now."
0x21A99E1C

0xB04A0E33
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0x444049F9

0xB04A0E33
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0x3508231A
Edward."
0xB0B86CAA

0xB04A0E33
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0x7BCBABC8
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x5595E2DD

0xB04A0E33
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0xFE153864
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0xF0BFC320
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x0CCC4523
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x15FC719C
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0xB3392674
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x7130A243
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x0BEBE7AD
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x43241F42
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0x9BC7090E

0xB04A0E33
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0x59B9A279

0xB04A0E33
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0xF66706AE
quite a desolate spot."
0x559488B6

0xB04A0E33
"Who is with him?"
0x0428E967

0xB04A0E33
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0x51FE1D00
down, they say."
0xF0800892

0xB04A0E33
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x1BBB77B7

0xB04A0E33
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0x02BC19AD

0xB04A0E33
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0xCC95C01C
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0x484B7C9D
you usually demand."
0x629124D5

0xB04A0E33
CHAPTER XXXVII
0x003EBE7B

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x60255513
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xF991FA1E
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x42A478E9
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0xAB702ADC
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x37D663F5
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x38D40A64
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x1114E87B
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x51B15D1A
there in the season to shoot.
0x0E9D259B

0xB04A0E33
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0xDAE697DE
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0xBD844B9B
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0xAF188EDC
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x96848CF9
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0xBEFD1785
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x4313DB0F
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x8304E77B
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0xD77E1BF8
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x7B1D222A
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0xAC66AA69
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xFBCD6FB7
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x5BC75236

0xB04A0E33
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x532623BB
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0xC563D8BC
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0xD1E8D6F2
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0xA8B18A41

0xB04A0E33
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0xB987A257
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xE32F50B1
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x6693C324
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0xDD18FE93
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x10508FB3
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x687EC981
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0xADF25DF5
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x2CFF9DE4
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0x8D363446
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x4CE492C2
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0x17550D6C
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0xEF38C112

0xB04A0E33
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0x23C4103D

0xB04A0E33
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x62C17DBC
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xEFBEFB9C
grange.
0x80364BD1

0xB04A0E33
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0x86548A69
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x15C23887
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0xAF522BB7
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x55EDD7B8

0xB04A0E33
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0x53B390E4
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x6CC2BAC8
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x617D0D89
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x63279223
advance.
0x9FE04E7E

0xB04A0E33
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0x1ED65E3D
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0xDABA15B0
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xB78EB9BF
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x6999CAD8
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x93A9B337
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x9AD957CC
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x46A15817
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x2C01F931

0xB04A0E33
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x01D94563
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x9D117C0A
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0xA07A65FA
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x6751824A

0xB04A0E33
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xBAB4F7F1
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0xA13C807E
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xFC3633A6
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0x4DCEC6E3
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x5B814B44
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0xF4AC428C
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0xA6B5529D
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x7EC15733
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x6D330484
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0x14760C8B
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x00867790

0xB04A0E33
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0x6754D7F6
had you not better go in?"
0x5CEAFCF1

0xB04A0E33
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0xE7B22BDE

0xB04A0E33
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x73A18CE6
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0xB10BFFD6
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0x6A30849A

0xB04A0E33
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0xBCB965BE
"how are you?"
0x9AA47BB4

0xB04A0E33
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0xDC312F57
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0x64016E57
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0xB992390A
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x5F7FF991
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x15A02687
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x6CF86DAA
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x58B53370
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x152AFE69
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0xCE752CE4
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0xEC9E63CB
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0xA90CA6C4
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0x147F4978

0xB04A0E33
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0x87211670
to him, but do not give my name."
0xFD7816A7

0xB04A0E33
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xD3DB4097

0xB04A0E33
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x9DD9021D
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x8B3BB711
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x17F757FF

0xB04A0E33
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0x2D72C3A6

0xB04A0E33
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x049C6D39

0xB04A0E33
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0x3A434DE0

0xB04A0E33
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0xDE2595F9
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x4B8067A6
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0x4971A410

0xB04A0E33
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x293F3BD8
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x4B641C6E
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x5C450EF5
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x9847DAC0
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x6F448168
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x520C235C
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x7F065DC1
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x8806CDC8
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x3D2B2C22
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x47233516

0xB04A0E33
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0x5F8E5115

0xB04A0E33
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0xC4C40433
still excited.
0x2A4D6A4C

0xB04A0E33
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0x117EEA60

0xB04A0E33
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x3364CFF0
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x9A437629
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x024D7DC1

0xB04A0E33
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0xBFC6975A

0xB04A0E33
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x751F0849
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x832D8645
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x2E9D5C4D
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x468FFEEA
and aloud.
0xAA6E2DD7

0xB04A0E33
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x0D132F54
glass," I said.
0xA053C535

0xB04A0E33
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"

0xB04A0E33
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x1A0366D8
evening," I answered.
0x75477B98

0xB04A0E33
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x26DFD1BB
seized me?"
0x3A95621F

0xB04A0E33
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x047F1824
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x8BA54CC0

0xB04A0E33
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x374131A5
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0x0CF32C1F
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0x420A32C4

0xB04A0E33
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0xC62963B3

0xB04A0E33
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x5457C6F9
must be more of her."
0x34CD30E4

0xB04A0E33
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xE1B1A66B
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0xDE586FC7

0xB04A0E33
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0xD9834149

0xB04A0E33
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0xCB5BF9D4
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x67E96944

0xB04A0E33
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x3B04A3E8

0xB04A0E33
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0x8A7FB8DD
come back to you."
0xA332015F

0xB04A0E33
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xDA7D70E5

0xB04A0E33
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x18FA3C4D
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0xB43D224D

0xB04A0E33
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x291C5A61
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x9A8BE80E
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xBECD6A33
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x7542B69A
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x30C4FA65

0xB04A0E33
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0xD5A54D5F

0xB04A0E33
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x012FB3B7
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x3509E52D
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0xBF90F597
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xD1A5457C
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0xDCE2CC0D
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0xB6A252F3

0xB04A0E33
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x39D25982

0xB04A0E33
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0xA394E38C
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xC0F2DA5A
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0xD2C88290

0xB04A0E33
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0xFE28C609

0xB04A0E33
"I am."
0x9F40A019

0xB04A0E33
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0xF25AF5C1
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x863554E0

0xB04A0E33
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0xBCA81CB9

0xB04A0E33
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x29BE7E68

0xB04A0E33
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0x496E8008

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0xAEC44139
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0x3B9776CB
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x25413635
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x907BFF49

0xB04A0E33
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0xF24B606F
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0xCFBCCA34
company of an evening."
0xBC1AAB1A

0xB04A0E33
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xEE569F4F
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0xBFC88AA6
me?"
0x774A49E6

0xB04A0E33
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x8ADAFC3D
mistress."
0x8DDE94D0

0xB04A0E33
"And you will stay with me?"
0xE9066554

0xB04A0E33
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x34CAF20D
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0xF554AD09
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0xB2866F48
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0xED79E6BD
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x78AC1070

0xB04A0E33
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xF6EF2BDC
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xD62E0823
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xBF16768C
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x66517E4A
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x3BC6BCE9
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0x1FEBC6EE
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x4C4B9D3F
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x21ECF3D8
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0xA14C1A80
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x1BA9F278
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x85303AEB

0xB04A0E33
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x6697BE85
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x1F138062
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0xA0840CDF
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0xF2A99D58
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x676DFFE6
vengeance on its frame."
0x3D3D80BE

0xB04A0E33
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0xDC1FC4D0

0xB04A0E33
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x49B10A9B
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x55AC136A
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x81CF3792
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x4029B0D7
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0x5AA52B44
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0x9D33E30E
Come--tell me."
0xE00A4C40

0xB04A0E33
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x361E95A6
you think it better."
0x1C835079

0xB04A0E33
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0xF31B5476
one day."
0xC119DBBF

0xB04A0E33
"I don't care about being married."
0x3274628D

0xB04A0E33
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0x85BB9CC6
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0xFC37021A

0xB04A0E33
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0xD011B302
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0xE88FD0BF
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x792B3317
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x08F92387
conversation.
0x583DBFB3

0xB04A0E33
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xD7E6E1C8
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0xE3452A87
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x0AC76CAB
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0x14956FB0
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0xE72BC528
not yet noticed."
0xA38D81D6

0xB04A0E33
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x12CF1685
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xE0A128B6
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0xC80C36F3

0xB04A0E33
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x7B536150
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0xFE84AC1D
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0x26829EF0

0xB04A0E33
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0xE630C724
cicatrised visage."
0xEDB17A34

0xB04A0E33
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x413B8F6F
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x7701CAC2
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0x9AA41B97

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x9B7C617A

0xB04A0E33
"And you see the candles?"
0x6289AD98

0xB04A0E33
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xD8307B92

0xB04A0E33
"Can you see me?"
0xF3D4B99E

0xB04A0E33
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0xDE639BFE

0xB04A0E33
"When do you take supper?"
0xC1D4D79B

0xB04A0E33
"I never take supper."
0xAD005809

0xB04A0E33
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0xD3A5B355
only you forget."
0x674A2A03

0xB04A0E33
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0xD498DA33
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0x803F0007
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0xFD588F64
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0xDAEEAF9E
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xDB219407
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x456F8B3F
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xEC04295F
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0xB1667DAD
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0x09ADABCE
lineaments softened and warmed.
0x67260E14

0xB04A0E33
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x6C427B16
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x30FA1AEB
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0xC201F13C
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x8CD0C1F9
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x5768AF25
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0x297E18D6
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0x4D04E311

0xB04A0E33
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0x1624AE3C

0xB04A0E33
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0x5C110018
p422.jpg}
0xD67D5C7B

0xB04A0E33
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0xDA818A79

0xB04A0E33
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0xFC41D86B
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0xCF7C2DDA
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x69DB1C3D
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0xC4C83AFF

0xB04A0E33
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0x745D61C6

0xB04A0E33
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0x121DF501
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x349A1581
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x2D52F4DD
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0x4D966BEA
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x7ECBE8ED
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0x1CB3DA38
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x936E47EC
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x0BBF0799
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0x8D8198EC

0xB04A0E33
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x7F95BBA2
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x36FA769F
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0x246E7D15
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x339C89F3
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0xDD825911

0xB04A0E33
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0x13AC2A58
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0xE96D721A
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0x466AAF21
undiscoverable?
0x511DC5AE

0xB04A0E33
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0xEDD08ECB

0xB04A0E33
"What for, Jane?"
0x2B1637DA

0xB04A0E33
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0x09492196
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0xFB8EF68A
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x1D9192BE

0xB04A0E33
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0x63AB3F00

0xB04A0E33
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x29CDD42F

0xB04A0E33
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0xDE52611E
sojourned."
0x97992F95

0xB04A0E33
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0x4AEF26FC
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0xC3D1EB30
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0xEE66D9C7

0xB04A0E33
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0x742557F3

0xB04A0E33
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0x18DC5124
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0x54B4FDBE
substantiality."
0x8DDAB45E

0xB04A0E33
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x297A8C83

0xB04A0E33
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xFC43D613
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0x022D7EA5
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x430D398B
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0x28A80840
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0x1103A6D3
ham."
0xBF328671

0xB04A0E33
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0xD7831AF5
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0x8C42D249
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0x030AF69C
harp."
0xEA766FF4

0xB04A0E33
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x46F27556
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xC7756614
night."
0x56AEA43C

0xB04A0E33
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x77AF43DB
been?"
0x844AF268

0xB04A0E33
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0x3033FBB5
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0xDFBCF8D7
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x7BEC3AE2

0xB04A0E33
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x9D7A68A4
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x4DD2FB49
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xC24A60E1
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0xF8FE2BA4

0xB04A0E33
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0xAB7A8442
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0xD5CF70EF
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x7CDE76EB
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x39F8AA19
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x4B51C935
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x3B61CCD5
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x366F2AB5
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x87385CC1
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x5B89EB04
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x0444697F
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x351D9086

0xB04A0E33
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x2A9EDA55
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x351CD842
soon."
0x7C262EDD

0xB04A0E33
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0xA613FAF5

0xB04A0E33
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x9F51AFF5
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xDAF1EF8A
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x9FB87BDB
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0xCD9A5900
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x45BF708C
can feel is in her presence."
0x2A67B711

0xB04A0E33
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x9F5A3CDA
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x6F6BAEB7
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0xEE98CCEE
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x564A8941

0xB04A0E33
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0xE193C2E4
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x6BF211F5
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x0D6A990A
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x88C53261
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x23DE7751
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xA6A5A721
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0xEBD99A8E
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x2995C51C

0xB04A0E33
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x3B631BAA
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0xA72A9330
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x84D420E9
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x1EA8910E
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0xCECB940F
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x6C5E685E
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0x63432FB2
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xAF2A31B9

0xB04A0E33
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x78EDD1A0
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x0AF874E9
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0xA66917D8
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x3B9C4288
deeper than I wished.
0xF0E741F5

0xB04A0E33
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0xBE27A715
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0xAEA19AF0
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x0A7558BC
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x17D97657
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x13CC8726
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0xEB76D19F
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x8C39DB41
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x3731A6B4

0xB04A0E33
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0xCD586367
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x1C10095F
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0xAAA1F96A
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x2F815386
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xBEDA790A
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0xD1B30870
up.
0xE47CFC71

0xB04A0E33
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0xCC62FEF7

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0xA01573D7

0xB04A0E33
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0x1E5DFA62

0xB04A0E33
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x32272A17
Or what does it mean?"
0x96AD67BB

0xB04A0E33
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0x1D41E3A3

0xB04A0E33
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x1F521814
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x252693DA
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0x87379EED

0xB04A0E33
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0x59B99095
perform."
0x6C8F094D

0xB04A0E33
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x28F486C3
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0xD427A491

0xB04A0E33
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0x8A27AD59
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0xB7159856

0xB04A0E33
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x4AFE52EC

0xB04A0E33
"Truly able."
0x6898A52C

0xB04A0E33
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0x4F6F37EF

0xB04A0E33
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x98604A0B

0xB04A0E33
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0x05407484
parsonic?"
0xD0D17AA4

0xB04A0E33
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0xD1EC1E1C
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x16B21CB0

0xB04A0E33
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x564380E4
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0xDA77EDD8
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x15B2E1F3

0xB04A0E33
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0x220BED92
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0x9925A64A

0xB04A0E33
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0x2DF54216

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0x299B1D21

0xB04A0E33
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x6F4B6D28
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x41DB6685
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0xA144FE6E
immediately charm the snake.
0x239F0D73

0xB04A0E33
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x0E60C3BB
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0x366C20A2

0xB04A0E33
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0xB2413D02

0xB04A0E33
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xFCF337FA
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0xEB3D2208
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x064FDFEC
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x852B8A4E
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x45A8B16A
bargain."
0xBD2CD21E

0xB04A0E33
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0x91A99F1B
sir."
0x1E542B6C

0xB04A0E33
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0x6934AF4C
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0x15A13460
question or two."  He paused.
0xAC33B1A5

0xB04A0E33
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0xC8E2613C

0xB04A0E33
Then followed this cross-examination.
0x91921811

0xB04A0E33
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x7B071388
cousin?"
0xC7F25A6F

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0xC126D0DA

0xB04A0E33
"Daily."
0xD9B9855B

0xB04A0E33
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0xE506FEF5
you are a talented creature!"
0xABC6969E

0xB04A0E33
"He approved of them--yes."
0xDABD739B

0xB04A0E33
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0x8E771E2D
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0xB946E4C1

0xB04A0E33
"I don't know about that."
0xE60D6E0A

0xB04A0E33
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0x8CC7285A
there to see you?"
0x8EBFC62F

0xB04A0E33
"Now and then?"
0xF4EBF4E9

0xB04A0E33
"Of an evening?"
0x9AA342F4

0xB04A0E33
"Once or twice."
0xB8598EE8

0xB04A0E33
A pause.
0xFD7CD01B

0xB04A0E33
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x06A12F7C
was discovered?"
0x72270D78

0xB04A0E33
"Five months."
0x18A3863C

0xB04A0E33
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0xCC167821

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0xF1CE93C1
window, and we by the table."
0x214A8C1F

0xB04A0E33
"Did he study much?"
0x3938C770

0xB04A0E33
"A good deal."
0xD6CF984A

0xB04A0E33
"What?"
0x65AB8C8F

0xB04A0E33
"Hindostanee."
0x5CC45A54

0xB04A0E33
"And what did you do meantime?"
0xE69B38B3

0xB04A0E33
"I learnt German, at first."
0xF210BB9B

0xB04A0E33
"Did he teach you?"
0x043AE38B

0xB04A0E33
"He did not understand German."
0x18749FD7

0xB04A0E33
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0x379AC6EC

0xB04A0E33
"A little Hindostanee."
0x9A95F378

0xB04A0E33
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0x213BA9DB

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"And his sisters also?"
0x15193C19

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"Only you?"
0xAC442A60

0xB04A0E33
"Only me."
0x071336A5

0xB04A0E33
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x2940E57E

0xB04A0E33
"No."
0xC68EFDF8

0xB04A0E33
"He wished to teach you?"
0xA30D228E

0xB04A0E33
"Yes."
0x18DA4E64

0xB04A0E33
A second pause.
0x633D6D51

0xB04A0E33
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0x9EB8A015

0xB04A0E33
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xC427DDA0

0xB04A0E33
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0xB423475E

0xB04A0E33
"He asked me to marry him."
0x417113FF

0xB04A0E33
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0xF34858D4

0xB04A0E33
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0x7C2131B6
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0xF4214FCF

0xB04A0E33
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0x25B6F7EA
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0x6CD66975
have given you notice to quit?"
0x9A6BEE99

0xB04A0E33
"Because I am comfortable there."
0xF7E11738

0xB04A0E33
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0x48B9643D
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0x94E469BC
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0x03F36630
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x8F13D6D0
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x936C2425
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0x0BE07EEB
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0x30125ABA

0xB04A0E33
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0xBCBE3309
accord."
0x76FAB1B1

0xB04A0E33
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0x73562E4F
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0xC19B3EF5
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0x7D525374

0xB04A0E33
"Where must I go, sir?"
0xBB662974

0xB04A0E33
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0xC97FE73D

0xB04A0E33
"Who is that?"
0x1420D774

0xB04A0E33
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0x587A5E93

0xB04A0E33
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x25586A54
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x9D1F7488
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0xD19A167F
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0x4E6B75DF
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0xF9B9562F
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x096AFEDB
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x760CC228
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x7C1C9011
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0x8B658572

0xB04A0E33
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x011F27F0
beloved master.  He smiled.
0x98D1E824

0xB04A0E33
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0xAC007F1F
you and Rivers?"
0x30E6618D

0xB04A0E33
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0xEA2655CA
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0xD802F9D2
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x3AF979A9
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0xFBE31D14
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0x7C517BDD
of me from your presence for ever."
0xA944B7AB

0xB04A0E33
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0x64903BF7

0xB04A0E33
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x1065B29C

0xB04A0E33
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x7F7E232E
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x4E975CFA
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x0956A612
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0xDE1CC94E

0xB04A0E33
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xB815C1AF
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0x3BBC380B
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0x18EF0EA7

0xB04A0E33
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0x3249A291
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xE28F76A6
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x7234A7C3
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0xBADDAC69
offers them so safe a prop."
0x4FC56152

0xB04A0E33
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0xD96EF89D

0xB04A0E33
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0x736FC086

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0xE6C7BC8C
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x1D335131
helped me.
0xA05C80C9

0xB04A0E33
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0xA045C215

0xB04A0E33
"Do you, sir?"
0x2AF859DA

0xB04A0E33
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0x26A19C92

0xB04A0E33
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0xE7AE9F18

0xB04A0E33
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0x925EB252

0xB04A0E33
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0xDF45CAC8

0xB04A0E33
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0x470E0669

0xB04A0E33
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x704DD023

0xB04A0E33
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0xA6E3585E

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0xBD3F37DE

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0x818F2E90
on?"
0xD8C88A44

0xB04A0E33
"Yes, sir."
0x4D21F29C

0xB04A0E33
"Truly, Jane?"
0xC758A49A

0xB04A0E33
"Most truly, sir."
0xB57AA9FB

0xB04A0E33
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0xBC48E945

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0xFEDD8930
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0x7F1D43C5
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0x40482A94
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0x517F102C

0xB04A0E33
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x985DAAF6

0xB04A0E33
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0x4232755A
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0xF14AC559
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0xAF3A29CC
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x828A748A

0xB04A0E33
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0x145E258F

0xB04A0E33
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0xD18D195F
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x37F8CE93
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0xD971668F

0xB04A0E33
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0xEA2F4101
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0xE1302DDB
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0x86D6FA9F
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x97AF27A2
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0xC64C3C02
her?"
0x3942697D

0xB04A0E33
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x5C68D64C

0xB04A0E33
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0x73361F57
married instantly."
0x47682169

0xB04A0E33
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x86FEF6AA

0xB04A0E33
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0xF7E91E18
licence to get--then we marry."
0xDEB115F7

0xB04A0E33
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0x73ABB918
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0x34096182
your watch."
0x43A34DD1

0xB04A0E33
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0xBD99B97F
use for it."
0x5E2E14BD

0xB04A0E33
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x8104D63B
hungry?"
0xD1D84E4A

0xB04A0E33
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0x09FDD90E
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0x882CFB02

0xB04A0E33
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x20C11F62
is quite hot."
0x47662230

0xB04A0E33
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0xB70E8960
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0xD71EA182
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0x253FAC00

0xB04A0E33
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0xFA4559B9

0xB04A0E33
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0x15CC7AAB

0xB04A0E33
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x18C99EAB
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0x115DB054
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0x65EA3A3B
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xBFD18FEA
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x8B362F8A
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0x726583AA
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xF2EE9373
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xD9CE7A91
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0x739FAA3C
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0x700ABECA
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x5904C318
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x6EA71DBB
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x2FF2CDB9
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0xD2880E8C
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0x2A9CC5ED

0xB04A0E33
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0xC188958A
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x58A6723F
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0xE3578B27
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0x7BDCAC03
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x62AE5755
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0x6682180C
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x6B6BDCC1
rejoining Jane.
0x7B4A4D7A

0xB04A0E33
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0xBDB914DB
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0xD181994A
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x3F77B617
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x9ED92621
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x9AE6DF34
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x4B3500D7
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0x3E5C72CB
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0x765F17C5
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0x9E6EF629
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x58560870

0xB04A0E33
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0x97B37225

0xB04A0E33
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0xC1867E18
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0x3E9E8F1B

0xB04A0E33
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0x6F3C9D62

0xB04A0E33
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x6252FD55
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0x90395FE5
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0x818E42E2
that I heard what I now relate.
0xEAAED4C4

0xB04A0E33
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0x172F23D8
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0xEE971A9B
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x7E7E6AF5
are you?'
0xA4B899F3

0xB04A0E33
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0xFA7FCFEC
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xEFFDF3A1
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0x325A01E0
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0x949E8A19
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x920DF73A
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0xE35AC20C
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xA9ECB450
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x7957A5D1
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0xA69550A1
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0x03C141F6

0xB04A0E33
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xDF573E7E
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xF3186D22
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xAA3356B2
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x264B03C7
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0x70CDC8F4
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0x0ECEC8FB
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0xC0D28AA6
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x9607AB4E
them in my heart.
0x1F78D8EB

0xB04A0E33
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xB8FB1777
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0x72DC6226
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0xDBC6FD13
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x8D81EC07
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0x4CC65BE6
God!"
0x53CA2FDF

0xB04A0E33
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0x400CED04
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x47BF28DB
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x6D8EA1ED

0xB04A0E33
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0x33C0613D
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0xB2270928
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0x23C51C5C

0xB04A0E33
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0xA35BBB0A
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0xDE82814B
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x92B4CA42
entered the wood, and wended homeward.

CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x04C95740

0xB04A0E33

0xB04A0E33
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0x018526BA
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x770D099C
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x2BF04C04
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0x898C546A

0xB04A0E33
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xAD6DE33D
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x911F7325
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x3881ED15
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0xBF47F41C
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x4708428E
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0xFE583B65
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x9B999C17
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0x955A4110
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x4477B7AE
again over the roast, said only--
0xD1A626F0

0xB04A0E33
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0xCF7BFDAD

0xB04A0E33
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x4542965A
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0xAA50C13A
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0x939D6AB8

0xB04A0E33
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x8AEFE460
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x986F2D1F
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x538AD07D
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0xFA3A46FF
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x00BE72DD
politely pulled his forelock.
0x5B9E23F3

0xB04A0E33
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x635F6643
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0xC0212A55
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0x9E295822
caught the words--
0xB8E04784

0xB04A0E33
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x7D3F40C1
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x4DFB8A78
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x428D65F5

0xB04A0E33
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0x5DFAE4E0
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x55ED515A
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0xA7C4A55A
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xDB33C7D2

0xB04A0E33
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0xB04B89B3
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0xE066801C
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x1DB13F3A
grave or mine."
0x958A1C33

0xB04A0E33
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0xE5F57380
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x22E77726
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0x583B8848
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0x04E04CD6
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x8C6FFD35
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x23BCD946
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x57EAC252

0xB04A0E33
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x1DDB8036
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0x7BFAE701
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0x9614A798
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x8019F715
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x1BC4DBE0
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x3D8492FD
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x64F0D3C5
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x082895C4
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0x31971E5A
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0xAB7D1037
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x0B49941D
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0xEEF1097A
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0x36936737
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x544A2F3B
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x727B9C17
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x751378F6
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x7B5BF5B6
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0x92C49154

0xB04A0E33
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x3821714C
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xEA7D7DC0
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0xB7D6C0FF

0xB04A0E33
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x190B41D9
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x05D44702
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0xFBB0A78F
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xA99BCDB7
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x35DDFE73
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x55759315
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0x5E5B74CE
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xC260EED8
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x6AB816D6
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0xF969517C
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x3E068498
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0xF6A56C5E
concord is the result.
0x8A15504D

0xB04A0E33
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0xEE02FEE3
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0xB9A529FF
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x604485FF
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0xB74C8CFE
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x105ED864
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xD4272773
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x247C0713
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0x03E12DC6
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xF9204D09
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x78BA84D9
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xFCD2535B
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0xA8822359
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0xC8C02C0E
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0xDD9FFBDC
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0xCA1C8329

0xB04A0E33
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x4611D26E
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0x01988775
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0xB7835F21

0xB04A0E33
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x9F1B8D0F

0xB04A0E33
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0x59C6C55B

0xB04A0E33
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0x553DEA92

0xB04A0E33
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xD6680F73
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0xA236A1E7
sure of it.
0x59176360

0xB04A0E33
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x70C3732C
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x8A90539B
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x518C933B
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x327D2F4E
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0x9FC79353
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xCB36D825
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x80FB935B
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0xC9530292

0xB04A0E33
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x754B6A44
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x239B6C53
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0xD68F627F
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x0139DCB2
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x739C5D8C
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x76D18AE6
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x54F4D4B7

0xB04A0E33
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0xFB61CA6B
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x247C3285
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0xB19AC4DB
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x1159CEFD
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0xC1854252
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x1A16B6CA
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x8D406851
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x85B15A15
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x9D94EC73
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0xEE65B3E9
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0xC381F1C3
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0xAB8C0CF2
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x396D0638
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0x8C7358F6
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x447D433C

0xB04A0E33
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x6C21BE7F
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0xDDE7218C
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x1B4B18C6
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x1844F03B
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xF3973BD3
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0x2036F479
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x6A4B8D61
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x3EBCAA26
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0xEB674188
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0x5A443567

0xB04A0E33
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x530F4ECC
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0x6B7B0819
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0xFC573A0B
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0xE0727ECD
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0x4C34681D
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0xCED19489
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0x5EC491C9
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0x7AFEAC62
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
0xE8B6957E
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0xE9E0BE4D

0xE9399878
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0xE47A4555

0xB04A0E33
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0x88950260
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0xB42DDDAB
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
