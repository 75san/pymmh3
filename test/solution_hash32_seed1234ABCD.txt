PREFACE
0xE7F19109

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x73C89195
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x210E71AF
miscellaneous remark.
0xA7055DC0

0x8D5AA8FB
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x9E481ABC

0x8D5AA8FB
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x099C627B
few pretensions.
0xA0EB1A5F

0x8D5AA8FB
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x062B03C6
obscure aspirant.
0x258CB790

0x8D5AA8FB
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x4CB2691D
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x257D1A59
Author.
0xA971CEC4

0x8D5AA8FB
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x6A1D7186
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x3BEDFFE5
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0x722F3F09
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0xBBA9FD98
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x5CC94E39
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0xC884B6B4

0x8D5AA8FB
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0xCC6B1337
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0x74915CAC
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0xCEF1C896
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x23407FAB
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x9132D946
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0xAB91194D
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x4448FD74
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0x170FD1D8

0x8D5AA8FB
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0xFB61538E
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x97B49095
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x4D8AF600
Thorns.
0xA98037F5

0x8D5AA8FB
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0x215CAF22
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x1DFFB41F
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x66B0CE8E
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xF7F10558
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xE2520E44
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0x1F9236DB
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0xCC719014

0x8D5AA8FB
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x2C5B3B61
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0xED96EDEF
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xBB25B9B0
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0xA80A811F
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x88C86EDA
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0xA569EAD0

0x8D5AA8FB
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0xE72F0611
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x093C345C
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0x6C7D255F
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x42A7FBA0

0x8D5AA8FB
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x5A6C56EB
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0xAACC007C
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0xF543ACD4
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0xD9A6EDFA
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0xDAF661C7
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x6ABC7A2F
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x027C1244
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x51494589
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x0F80C010
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xFE93EFC3

0x8D5AA8FB
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x4B5FE815
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x5F3AFD58
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xEA28B6AC
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xA92F3065
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0xB3EDE11D
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0xA4881718
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0x4E97B4E4
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0xF773C768
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x83F25585
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0xDD5FDB14
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xFA386E53
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0xD8C22B17
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0xF846BF2D
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xA14DEC1E
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0xE61CB2F7

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x384A2DD2
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0xC9B9D035
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x9CA89025
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xBC30BA64
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0x739E99A9
denied where it is justly due.
0x16CE290B

0x8D5AA8FB
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0x87B4828C
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0x15B0C18E

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x7EECA184
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0xC800AE41
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0xA30CA926
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0x78DDBE19
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xBA9A507C

0x8D5AA8FB
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xA5A81138
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0xF9F5A5D6
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0x270122DE
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x79526836
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0xCFDC662A

0x8D5AA8FB
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x34E75E59
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0x1C98C64B
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x7E70CA15
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x0D9A5733
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0xAE7A0451
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0x0A0F1510
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x081D0938
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0xEB8D52F3
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x5ED45431
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0xDEE06728
little children."
0x45A00EE0

0x8D5AA8FB
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x69FCDBC7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x58C5558E
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0x4486DEE4
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0xAC6F8794

0x8D5AA8FB
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x7FB08233
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xC0EC6AAF
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x9DB40CD8
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x3D850663
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xCA600904
retirement.
0xF83B6432

0x8D5AA8FB
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x43B3DCA1
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0xB08788F8
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xBDCB1897
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xF8E06F6D
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x7AE4BEF3
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x38A71D3B
lamentable blast.
0x803B00ED

0x8D5AA8FB
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0xBF35E0C8
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x6A2246B5
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0xDB75AE5C
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x806FAFFE
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0xE050C094
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0xF6CC4639
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0xEAEFFB98

0x8D5AA8FB
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0xFA9207ED
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x2B8739D2
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xAD7DDE04
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x8FFDBB87

0x8D5AA8FB
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0x57554470
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x81F8ACFB
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x77706341
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x5EAA3D06
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0xC2C90836
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x0086E9D6
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0xFC3414CD
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x55401FD2
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0xCB72AEDF
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x9EB47287
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x8163F0A2
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x24A86E89
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x36F93337

0x8D5AA8FB
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0xC8C6BFF0
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x0937B189
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x72CBB1C4
hour of eventide.
0xFE804DB8

0x8D5AA8FB
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0x84C879E3

0x8D5AA8FB
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x82D5CB0F
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0x679801BB

0x8D5AA8FB
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x497C90CD
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0xF496AE94

0x8D5AA8FB
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x32D55FF9
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0xE2FBC8BA
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0xF7AFE7E6
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x955ADE5E
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x68CDAE5D
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x17FBED4A
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0x00235CC7
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0xB838EBA5
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x0AA938FF

0x8D5AA8FB
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0xBF46DC4F
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0xC731C967
room door opened.
0x4A0AB357

0x8D5AA8FB
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0xB85040DB
found the room apparently empty.
0x6B9595F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x472AB3D0
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x8BE576BB
animal!"
0xFF942481

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0xFA5F8DC7
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x4B64D40F
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0xDD3707AE
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x55FBE336

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x141F323B

0x8D5AA8FB
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x3182BFB3
forth by the said Jack.
0x0BF28133

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x207CF420

0x8D5AA8FB
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xC8BCD9C1
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x88599A65
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xF63C6D32

0x8D5AA8FB
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0xC86AE54C
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x5C6815CE
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0x59AE4A2A
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0xCA92A027
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x82D9EAD9
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x3EEFD166
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x5AC7D3AF
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0xA2BC4CF0
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x64AC0F6F
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xF7AF3217
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x8090EE41
home.
0xDAC74B53

0x8D5AA8FB
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x94F5AF08
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0x4FF848F5
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0xC920C326
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x6A8836F0
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x2202EAFC
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xD5A0B7BD
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xC67C1383
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x543A136F
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x72923993
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x3AD73D99
her back.
0xBFDC76E7

0x8D5AA8FB
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x7B0B110F
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0x706C475A
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x4B555949
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x86C273B3
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0xD333A98C
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0xFDF15BF2
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x592D3928
chair.
0xC2D2E53D

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x35E42818
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x5565021C
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x292C1915

0x8D5AA8FB
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0xEADEAD59
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x2A2F5F9C
insult.
0x76D26528

0x8D5AA8FB
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0xB310FBEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was reading."
0x621E9A85

0x8D5AA8FB
"Show the book."
0x57DED9EE

0x8D5AA8FB
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0xF4ECE7FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x74FAEAF5
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0x34173742
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0x393CC1DD
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0xCF3AAD97
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xCFC82584
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0xE7055707
the mirror and the windows."
0xF25C40EF

0x8D5AA8FB
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xF74159D7
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x5A8152EB
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x3BA26DA4
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0xD09F7879
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0xE6BE0CF7
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x614E7E49

0x8D5AA8FB
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x831A9F78
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x7A24E326

0x8D5AA8FB
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x889CC1AD
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x174A4CBF
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0x65C85012

0x8D5AA8FB
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0xEBCA39D2
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0x5E34F02F

0x8D5AA8FB
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0xC30ADA5F
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x7297FDC5
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x27AAEC9A
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0xEE1260B8
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0xB0C6A2FC
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0xB2766A90
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x6C435D9E
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xF1B5AD93
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x09B7E0CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0xD9ABD023

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x72F6FF09

0x8D5AA8FB
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0xB611B379

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0xB087E35D
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x19D48D7D

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER II
0xD73056C3

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xB6BBC89A
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x14E7F974
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x6DCDC300
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0xCEA472AF
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x280BFB84
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0xCC7C997E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x88C806DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0xF918FDCC
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0xDD2D7183
young master."
0xAB2D5C7B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x0FBD6999

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x661D03DE
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x43FCB338

0x8D5AA8FB
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x72498098
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xA3F20825
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x25A55BA6

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x3076F278
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x0EA373E5

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0xA1195EDD
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0xF951CD86
little of the excitement out of me.
0x69DA44C9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x2B03E42C

0x8D5AA8FB
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x69AC449C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0x3EC543B9
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0x953BC1AC
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xA61A07F5
incredulous of my sanity.
0xDEF35918

0x8D5AA8FB
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x2BB4A55F

0x8D5AA8FB
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0xFC2303EC
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x42355152
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0xAA0F1741

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0x7CC7EAA8
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0x48F912EA
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x926B0596

0x8D5AA8FB
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0xF94832E1
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xFF503CF8
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0x9628E606
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0xF6D9184F

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x3B77A3F1
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x6DD26887
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x8854B2B1
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x092C16B9
them."
0xB66FB465

0x8D5AA8FB
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x01F93382
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x0F25501E
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0xB77AE590
away, I am sure."
0xFA42F795

0x8D5AA8FB
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x19C92542
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xC9F0FA65
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0xAAE09E7A
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0xE7880AEE
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x2CA8EF86
fetch you away."
0x5AC46EB3

0x8D5AA8FB
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0xC4711E4C

0x8D5AA8FB
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x7E4066B6
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0x49B53EE5
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x8CBC786B
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x0622ECF2
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0x2B8AB9C2
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0xB2F6BC09
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0xA70A952B
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x9BE73F3E
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0x9820A3EB
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0xD37E9F31
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xD5E4C860
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0xF069C8BE
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x1CBE2CCD
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x3700D090
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x634F1D64
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0xD7758499

0x8D5AA8FB
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0x0DE8D87D
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x05B6C247
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0x7D255255
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0xFDD8764E
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0xACDDCC3C
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x7149E855
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x9E19E7D7
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0xAAA425B1
in spite of its grandeur.
0x9DAA627B

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0xF2FA83C4
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x83F41B6A
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0xD5BE889B
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xEBC4A0C1

0x8D5AA8FB
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x70EF19F3
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0x0BCAFED2
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xD3B7E3FF
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x47B97680
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xEDE950ED
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0x4C2B53C1
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x85C6B559
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0xB5FCD2BC
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0x64D90ECD
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0xE62129A7
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0x35278F56
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x75C4C01E
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x715FF7DB
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0xFEBAB218
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x84F8C659
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0xD3FD23C6

0x8D5AA8FB
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x9E3597E5
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x6A72C79B
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0xECAC0824
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x51E353FD

0x8D5AA8FB
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xFB693849
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0xBA8C4A7B
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x05E7E8DF
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x7CD90A9C
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x97BB6D2A
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0x30E2A0A2
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x61B68EE2
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0xCAF37F28
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x6198702B
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0xB1FCA6DE
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x85B5B69D
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0xBC2D3E71
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x3C426A5C
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0xB893D894
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x44C513C4
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x6F39DF1C
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x6566F55F
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x6326B1C4
night.
0xE80B1657

0x8D5AA8FB
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x07FE9CEF
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x83A2285A
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0xAF0C8A41
general opprobrium.
0xB7B150F4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x6A7D2B07
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0xC55EE1F6
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0xE3400066
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x7ED9DEEB
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xA7C02D52

0x8D5AA8FB
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x84B2AF92
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0xB77781B7
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0xE971E465
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0x775497E4
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xA17C2F8C

0x8D5AA8FB
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0x72BA4DA6
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xA98881C1
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0x725EBECA
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0xB82A2C11
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x14A2A5C3
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0xE8A78D6A
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x48F26D5F
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x660B5EC3
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x1AA1D22B
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x2D3EF0EE
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x8ABB1BCB
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0xC42D672E
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xA9D56C72

0x8D5AA8FB
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0xC4A61D8F
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0xEED59D73
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0xAF4DAD85
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0xA47C3A54
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x47449863
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x625B2A9E
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0xC568C3FC
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0xC47BDF0B
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x54AB5383
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x4ED0616E
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x6F4ACEA0
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xC098A149
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x3C8B1795
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x34F6C85C
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x65509CFF
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x4182E258
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0xE40883B7
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x8F84652A
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0xCFD7544B
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xDD807828
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x52A383F4
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x6D5CC36F

0x8D5AA8FB
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0xC6782EA8
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0xB5ABA468
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0xDDDF6CE5
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x6E675AC0
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0xB8B8B11A
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0xD16A26CC
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x3889AE44
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x1B0B4CA3
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x72310047
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0x90737735
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0xD53A1885
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x4921749F
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0x19C369FD
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x36ACDA94
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x89BA9530
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x9B0EBB5B
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0x71D1735B
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x3463E31D
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x516BD1F9
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x06136E09
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0xD506B888
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0xF05F0539
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x297F599A
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0x6538133C
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0xCC4F6DCA
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0x9F4136D1
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x5525441F
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0xFACD11AD
Abbot entered.
0xBE8F8250

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x107798F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0xE57AD2B4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xCA7EEC7A

0x8D5AA8FB
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xBE46D8D5
Bessie.
0xDA574830

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x5AC9D0CB
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x0AFFA90C

0x8D5AA8FB
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0xF83EEAAF
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x73079F02
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0xD489D5CB

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0x399DC3E3
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x213F9682
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0xC194F623
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0xCDCA1F5B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0xDE5DBFAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x30A45187
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x033E10D6
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x52EAEB04
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x07AE9295
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x5B2EF9D7
then."
0x9C071386

0x8D5AA8FB
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xBC38EEFA
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x9D73B0E7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0xA9678270
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0x4716668D
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x2B9410EC
duplicity.

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x153C7440
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x42CE8B0D
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0xA12521BC
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0xEA320B88

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xB75F9631
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x6327AEE2
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x4DC87D69
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x30838B0F
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0xF206D697
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0xCDF14774
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x81BAA29F
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0xE989F36E
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xC74FB909

0x8D5AA8FB
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x15CB715A
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0x95D2BA7C
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x6A4DB636
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x9E2F50BF
pillow, leaning over me.
0x3BC96189

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0x291D5D76
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x4B1848B9
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0xBB108273
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x15005E4C
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x40F0EF81
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x05B23249
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x5A00F046
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x1FF8C5AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xBFE29AA1

0x8D5AA8FB
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0x6188AAEC
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x90F7C4B9
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0x01780990
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x9822D4EB
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x30266FDD
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x92C9932E
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0x28DB8778
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x09B58CC6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0xB71B9868

0x8D5AA8FB
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0xE47E05D6
rough.  "I will try."
0x7F4B7C2C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x3AB67CDB

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xBFBBC261

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x5CD6B8DE
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0xADF0E06A

0x8D5AA8FB
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0xA03A7FD0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x16F8E494

0x8D5AA8FB
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0xD36FF701
soon, no doubt."
0x0C3BF7FD

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0xF34FFB45
say--
0xC792BAB2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xAD77647F
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x745F3942
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x183EF8F0
rather too hard."
0xBD440D5B

0x8D5AA8FB
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x046CEF0A
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x6EE76BBE
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0xB691FC3B
the main subject discussed.
0x2ECDB207

0x8D5AA8FB
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0xD0109272
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0x9059D17C
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x7D668B60

0x8D5AA8FB
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0xB12E32CD
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x9710D9F8
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0x7253036D

0x8D5AA8FB
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xAB77EED1
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x64029726
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xA835DD9E
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x1502755C
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x4C820731
bad propensities.
0x883AA0D7

0x8D5AA8FB
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x55B5615E
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0xFBC37DDE
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0x426906AA
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x078B1FBD
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x5FAE55A7
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x9875ECDE
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x6770F3A5
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xAE7DDE4B
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x0B7BF11A
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xC26FFB47
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0x3E2E4B2B
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x56D597BB
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xF7D471D9

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0xCC3B54AB
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x7D174C11
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x8EC6E6DA
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x2841E188
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0x6B0CD255
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x90B6A4C3
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0xBA08E9D4
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0xCA25A6BD
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0x2F3DA5D9
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xF42234B8
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0xBC650654
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x1910555C
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x3C24445C
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0xA6EF661A
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x78EFB347
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x4D7EADB1
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x0172A7D5
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x9AFB9842
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0xA01B8ACB
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x6A7F5D30
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x87947FD5
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xB7AD3D0C
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x31726250
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x98280F4C
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x9B13A5FF
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x1CFB3C06
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xC52BB132
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x36F89EFC
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0x1444C723
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x632408E0
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0x7E92AE63
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x9C9D1F06
untasted tart.
0xB6973428

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x51D980F1
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0x1E6E554F
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x330115BB
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x5B13C7AE

0x8D5AA8FB
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x52D000BA
      A long time ago."
0x1837C970

0x8D5AA8FB
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x53F05565
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x73647AB7
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x6B9D507B
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x6007E58B
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0xA1F0CB73
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0xD81B7E7C
one.
0xED7F59F4

0x8D5AA8FB
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x112EF12E
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0xE17EFA81
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x29FD68EA
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0x5394135A

0x8D5AA8FB
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0xF2D0A231
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0x379EE2A2
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0xCBAAD85E
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x1D5F537C

0x8D5AA8FB
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0xF5E60C4E
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0xCE67E14D
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xB1D903E3
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0xB89A968D

0x8D5AA8FB
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x66C2A969
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x1E8E3248
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x43E4E436
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0x8BC58D32

0x8D5AA8FB
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0xCFDABAF4
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x9B3327D9
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0xF7ED892A
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0x9F74F58A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0xE1DBB1A9
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x12FE139C
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0xF8BACD6C
Lloyd came again.
0x1489BB0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x47B229EF
how is she?"
0x9C5EACE7

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0x09D1612A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x8979A289
is Jane, is it not?"
0xF3E1A3D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x5971D976

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0xF088F7AD
Have you any pain?"
0x3FC951CB

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir."
0x61955C12

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x39FF00FD
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0xA570D5FF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0xC9422C04

0x8D5AA8FB
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0xF613C62B
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0xB77EA714
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0x48FEA051

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0xF30B0959

0x8D5AA8FB
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x4015563D
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x77CE9E51
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0xFA6BFA1B
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0x8161106C
leisure, he said--
0xBB165807

0x8D5AA8FB
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0x3EA4C348

0x8D5AA8FB
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x5B719B46

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x94AF0188
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x3F42784A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0x6998B0E9
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0xF9866256
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xE176A6E7

0x8D5AA8FB
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0xF4E19C16
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0x63434C64
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x0B908FB4

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0xC896DB09
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x3D86AFE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x6184DCE1
Bessie was gone.
0x98449D10

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0x34C3C8CB

0x8D5AA8FB
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0x9926AEAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0xB2AF47A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x1CC16A88
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x61BFB0E5
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x31EC8454
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x9D4F65FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0x4767366E
daylight?"
0x8B718FE5

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x204D0E79
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0x58B3B5F9

0x8D5AA8FB
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0xED95598D

0x8D5AA8FB
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0xDF094091
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x4BBA5377
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xDB0E91C2
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0xE19B624B
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x2A76DBF9
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0x69D64484
though, as far as it went, true response.
0xB15D8E75

0x8D5AA8FB
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0x8AB141BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x8EC76C96

0x8D5AA8FB
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x7A9439EF

0x8D5AA8FB
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0xC50259AA

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xEC895F00

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0x723E0B28
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0x54A44F29

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x1EB9860E
than a servant."
0x5DE98139

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0x077D9DE1

0x8D5AA8FB
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x99E9351A
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0xA2B4DF0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x63F5CAD0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think not, sir."
0x370D79A0

0x8D5AA8FB
"None belonging to your father?"
0x481E0ACE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0x20F7EB4F
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x140F15AB
them."
0xB66FB465

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0xB333F93D

0x8D5AA8FB
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x787FDCA6
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0x6FF237A1
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0x71D3FAB7
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x1DDA0AD7
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x499F3B94

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0xCC0DA130

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x261DF0B1

0x8D5AA8FB
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x2D01DA4F
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x03D25A90
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0xF9A1F392
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x387DA5AB
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0xB531DB9F
the price of caste.
0x29425C10

0x8D5AA8FB
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x3B108680

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0x4726844C
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x6033A7F9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x44728AA8

0x8D5AA8FB
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0xA59275A6
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xBB76CFBF
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0xA900437A
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x5BD6526F
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x7DC77471
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0x03A1E81D
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0x7D3245A1
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0xC2238D53
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xD6E220E5
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0xF652F259
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0xB8071556
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0x6191F925
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x2A4AA1CF
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0xD667A63B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0xBDD39F6D
musings.
0x4CF4DCEF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0xD82F7058
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x1F86A6D4
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x2BBF7FD9

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x28ED2C85
the gravel-walk.
0x83522D94

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xBFC56240
to her before I go."
0xD9782616

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x566E5D75
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0xFE85D1F4
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0xAEBC84FF
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0x2ACE7F7D
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0x0B889F2B
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x0F1A5982
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x7EDE3913
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x92E8D190
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x47A19DF2
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0xD142A849

0x8D5AA8FB
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0xB4CD71A0
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0x9E175FE3
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x6E289302
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x71B2ACD4
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x984988A7
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x99003B32
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x050AA172
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0xB5CD4FE3
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0x9BF2FBCC
of each other.
0x2117A440

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x57A722D2
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x14E2DC0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x63BD1026
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x169AAB44
little toad as that."
0x2EA70F3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0x13A7AA03
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0xA37AB5DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0xF19FFC4B
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x977B570D
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x0CF0FF7A
rabbit for supper."
0xECF40E3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
0x81D2F1AD

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER IV
0x19E8DE52

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0xDF5002B0
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0xE98C16FA
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xD5CD90E0
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x923FFB62
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x827544F4
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0xA7283BA6
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0xA27FE50A
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0x5BAC7A95
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x12C7077A
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x37A05251
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x93E91B53
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x747EC8DC
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0xE9EF68C0
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x8549338F
and rooted aversion.
0x5107DB86

0x8D5AA8FB
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0xA2372657
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xE961A9E4
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0x8A155F05
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0xAF49F8CB
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x21008C80
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x46D921BE
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xEEE9045E
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0xB5713701
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xD0BEDED7
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x935AF795
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xA81B0B03
was stopped rather harshly--
0xB9BEEDD0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x35335369
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x3C69C30D
should associate with her."
0xC97F90E8

0x8D5AA8FB
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x7B68DE7C
deliberating on my words--
0xDC11AE53

0x8D5AA8FB
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x5108DA1E

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0xD2C1029B
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x4DE8E6E8
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0xF3B8FDE0
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0xF320CBFD
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x70CB2466

0x8D5AA8FB
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x926ED118
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x48A9D5B6
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0x22C8AB97
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x23595F9A

0x8D5AA8FB
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xE58FDB6E
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x26DC0439
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0xFFB7CE2C
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x77962FD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0xF5CEFCDE
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0xF1E478DC
wish me dead."
0xE69AF9A1

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x8AAAAC37
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0x058F7AD3
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0xB5EBC7D6
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0xA7A38461
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0xCA115B61
in my breast.
0xF392799E

0x8D5AA8FB
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x641BEC08
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x6F8E8947
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0x40FD2229
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0x54996CF2
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xF027E150
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0x1A5B5F12
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0xE8ACD98B
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0xA6CAB66A
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x3D7E80BB
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xD61F1D96
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x86A971F4
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x31B3FC1A
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0xFFDFBAF5
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x1BFD3505
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x9C09A7D1
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0x456C1217
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0xBC4F7E1E
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x7772CCF3
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x9CCDEE7D
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x8CF57620
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0x63F6D50E
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x21DC1DFC
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0xEF8D131E
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x5816D44B
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0xACD1106C
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x33402DCD
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0xB1B224B3
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0x7F770A43
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0xBB11741F
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x92D4FC15
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xE24162B5
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x8CFD0569
to be happy likewise.
0x3E0D1256

0x8D5AA8FB
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x850FB4D0
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x49A09D6B
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x0BF1B08F
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x5662A3A6
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x9B9A8D24
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x9943B3B3
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x7434842B
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0xED154066
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x5A8BF796
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0x12B4772B
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x87336CF7
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xDBEF257C
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x5AE420B1
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0x2D5590C2
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x803A2BD3
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0xA5B7FA71
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x3394E4F2
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x95C40AAF
Gateshead Hall.
0xB1806F4A

0x8D5AA8FB
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xEB7F1D00
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0xC58E662C
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0x4533C3A9
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x26511466
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0xB637872E
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x8056724B
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x96340388
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0xA5178449
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xF36DCA4E
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x203BDDB4
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0xAF07F401
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x63E6B381
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xB333CB81
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x6D3ACD39
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xC47F15B1
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0x9FD6107E
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x2F8946A3
accuracy.
0xBCD59965

0x8D5AA8FB
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x175AC167
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x3739A760
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x7E95C0E2
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x6413A535
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0xF96FD3D4
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0xC86EEE3B
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0xBF634C10
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xAF7C5DD4
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x702526C3
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x4A1C428A
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x7A6E96CF
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x936947ED
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x96D4646E
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0x33E223E0
frost.
0x35607828

0x8D5AA8FB
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0xA4A68EAE
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x7EDA7337
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0x81DF0152
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xCBA39669
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0x6B0D6D14
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0xDEECB5B5
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0x0902146D
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0xE51EBDDD
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x303D9363
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0x1FC2A600
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x2B23FB25
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x96170962
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xBB47DC52
nursery.
0x2424BEA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x023236EC
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x527A2BA5
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x146526E1
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x9A1AE7E0
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x23DC5190

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x0766AD4C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x0B9DECD3
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x7ABD45F4
window for?"
0x62A00D24

0x8D5AA8FB
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x2DD51445
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xA6B96D50
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x5D57EC57
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0xF20F695B
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x1FE84D61
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0x53C6DB1D

0x8D5AA8FB
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x21709F70
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0xF983D3CE
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0xD13DEA39
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x7252F500
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x0DB9B60D
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x3AEC0B58

0x8D5AA8FB
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xB5F22FDF
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x70660F9F
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0xE8D00E1A
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x43C5BB11
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x1AAB5940
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0xB4A87E08

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x13FE511B
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x0223D765
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x030814D6
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x7E11D2BE
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x3DF18D36
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x87B43E8F
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x1F2A0AA7
by way of capital.
0xB6D40BA8

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0xDA995633
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x9441D041
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0xCF0D11E7
you."
0xC2BECC6C

0x8D5AA8FB
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x13EA213F
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0xA0158635
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0xA1F0361D
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x4DD16AF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ten years."
0x43552DB7

0x8D5AA8FB
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x7EFE6B1C
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0xDCE34EA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0xCC9853A5

0x8D5AA8FB
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x261D6509
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0xC1F9204D
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0x6F30A485

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0xD1D9468F

0x8D5AA8FB
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0xD3F890E7
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x39321E92
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x6C13092F
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x21358E80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0xB8C31EFD
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x40AB9A8A
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0xFDB2F221

0x8D5AA8FB
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0xC2BF04BF
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x4019525D
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x76FF262B

0x8D5AA8FB
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x38E22793
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x484C800E

0x8D5AA8FB
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x96025CB9

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x2A9890F6

0x8D5AA8FB
"A pit full of fire."
0x4EFB76DD

0x8D5AA8FB
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0xBB9D5D33
ever?"
0xCBFC2FF4

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir."
0x61955C12

0x8D5AA8FB
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x8C756D95

0x8D5AA8FB
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x6157AF78
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0x8ED65813

0x8D5AA8FB
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0x123B3622
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0xB00F0B5C
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x09CD16A2
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x6E55F2F3

0x8D5AA8FB
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x0EA853A7
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0xC07EAE1B
enough away.
0xE54A6B6C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x1F674ED5
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x735D8F86

0x8D5AA8FB
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x9F010FE2
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x9BB39FDE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x8216EA43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x85FE314C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sometimes."
0xE74BFA3D

0x8D5AA8FB
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x1A41C084

0x8D5AA8FB
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xBE201C3E
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xA1AEBD90
and Jonah."
0x1D01FCAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0xCBB6B13E

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir."
0x61955C12

0x8D5AA8FB
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x0C0DD7E2
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x36F49AD8
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x3DAA341E
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x82676E51
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x47C2B661
piety."
0x1E5EC78E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x9434BB21

0x8D5AA8FB
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0xDA23A199
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0xE4D9585A
give you a heart of flesh."
0x8E0E8032

0x8D5AA8FB
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x4CF7EF8E
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x9DAEE0EF
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0xCDF9DEFD
conversation herself.
0x79050148

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0xDC15DBFB
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0x8EDD8A0A
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x3BBA0059
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xA8BB6670
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x0C395CDF
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xEBDB089C
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xA241E59F

0x8D5AA8FB
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0xF38F8F33
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0xE1EAF83F
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0xE7F9C352
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xEA8C0A69
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0xB3A3CF29
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x058607F1
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x3F3462C3
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0xAFB35823
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0x0B98FA07
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xF811CD65

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0xB40093E3
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x4EC54638

0x8D5AA8FB
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0xB32E3476
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0x0E1731B6
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0x10D0FE3B
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x067BAF74

0x8D5AA8FB
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xE5DF766E
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0xACA9DF1F
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0xFB0815F0
Lowood."
0x4C77F068

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x15CB5A75
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x4C17BA51
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x96348576
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x3889AE23
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0x7401DD49
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xA2B09CBB
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0xB44B7839
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0xBD08CBD7
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0xDC22EFBF
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x335C3BE6
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0xEBBF43D9
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x4BA3BB4C

0x8D5AA8FB
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x1222556A
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xC2F52347
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0xB448B531
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x1372F526

0x8D5AA8FB
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0xCCD75295
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xABA6A540
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x823103CF
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xEE993E81
inhabitants."
0x3E88AC1C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0xEAF7CBB1
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0xFF9A500E
and prospects?"
0x87B18983

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x2399A911
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0x8420EE1D
of her election."
0x46CF96A3

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x68D359D9
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0xD0B6FB17
becoming too irksome."
0xE42D10EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0xEBEA1BB2
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0xA4B532FC
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0xBB43663C
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x4A1DF6C0
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x46AC07A3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x8E176C4D
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x5BDE9194

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0x6BA870D6
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x9DC07790
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x69C08B4B
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x1860EB42

0x8D5AA8FB
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0x1084B3E5
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0x40449217

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0xF4D95DC1
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x433F669A
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0xCE9C2552
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0xA76009FE
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0xD47C9CFC
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x28D9AAB3
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x81D1C054
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x0162A299
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0x25BB5128
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0xEF07FFAB
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0xBF08A2DC
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0xB2EB7741
handsome attire.
0x6F7889B8

0x8D5AA8FB
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xAC8DE265
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0xF43E2AF0
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x4EF64B43
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0xA68E244D
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x608E52B5
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0xCCE0090F
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0xAAB1954B
fomented now within me.
0xBA43C0EF

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x4B9E7E0F
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x6980DB5A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0xE0F304A9
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x0FA66B2F
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x3E73195B
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xEE341B51
to her.
0x58EB8936

0x8D5AA8FB
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x6019A0A2
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x2749E7AF
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x25AD63D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0xD6BD6444
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0xF3B4AE07
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x9ED0A2B2
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x2DEA4F3B

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x3C2BAC95
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0xCCF28D45

0x8D5AA8FB
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0x4A80558A
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x6AE89F13
used to a child.
0x6539D720

0x8D5AA8FB
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x04AB90A9
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x5B5C42FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x8BC0F1A7
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0xF8DCA50B
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0xDAE89D9F
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x71D28649
miserable cruelty."
0x5B1B58A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x433226F2

0x8D5AA8FB
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0xD2A2D8C4
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x60F7192C
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0xA7C18458
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0x9A025DA2
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x0AF06011
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0xDA583B1A
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0xAF92855C
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0x9EB41FF4
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x4A10A41B
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x138D39DF

0x8D5AA8FB
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xA985B08A

0x8D5AA8FB
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xFE9C4D6D
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x5A3D16C7
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x26F7B243
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x992C2E28
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0xB2232AF5
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x8CE376BE
would cry.
0x7F3BE5CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0xC56A0FAB
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x22763069

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0xDAF68AEF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0xB8F03EB8
your friend."
0xF33D4DBC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xB14CADCC
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xCEDFE0A2
you have done."
0xF2C45EE3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0xDC3935DD
their faults."
0x785212FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x8420BE5A

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0xC6DE9572
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0x44273006

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x80D3EF76
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xD182B215

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x80BB81F7
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0xFF3C0636

0x8D5AA8FB
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0xC1BACC7F
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0x4AA1EF85
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x3538EA7B
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x101C21E0
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0xA0A69B74
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xE25A1F45
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0xA839379B
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0xFA95F5B5
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0x3966E773
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x911341F3
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x16731A77
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x408C9133
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0xF69F763E
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x4B4D109F

0x8D5AA8FB
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0xC5940748
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0x05A102BB
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0xA6A08ED8
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0x6B2D98EC
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x370D5930
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x3C3DC9D9
of my nature.
0x0272D991

0x8D5AA8FB
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0xE4239E8D
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0xE0592867
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x60B55C92
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0xD6B31E83
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0xB7C693F2
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xA4C5DD92
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0xA6439553
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0x3C76A509
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0xFBCA7BC2
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x1B881C08
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x321CF89F
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xA25703C7
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x61E6EC15
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x333CD88C
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0xBCFA83BE
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x5707B2E4
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x97883430
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x2E995E5F

0x8D5AA8FB
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xBD3A9595
to lunch!"
0x5D7173DB

0x8D5AA8FB
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0x3E0FE808
came tripping down the path.
0x6799B6E7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0xB2947C47
called?"
0x15A0CC9C

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x2BA54979
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0xF6F4B6FE
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0x8231B466
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0xC783DEE6
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0xC80C26F4
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0x75886794

0x8D5AA8FB
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0x81277168
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xA7985E70

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0x002284E8
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x5CC466E3
suppose?"
0x6CF22269

0x8D5AA8FB
I nodded.
0x4482032B

0x8D5AA8FB
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x236DCCAB

0x8D5AA8FB
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x6ADF1F63

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0x1F50E87B
be bolder."
0xFFD90770

0x8D5AA8FB
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x3F55A6D4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x88E9A486
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x3E46F0CF
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x0B6B1298
for you."
0x190E8F28

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0xC4F1D927

0x8D5AA8FB
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0xE89269D5
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x08A7B002
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xA7308D1E
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xA457FBFF
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x78439241
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x317C3CA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x35DFB222

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x1A3C3908
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0xD332757B
provoking."
0xD515B867

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0x31285BC6
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0xE738ABC1
dread."
0x8D65E67D

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x4197BC6D

0x8D5AA8FB
"As you do, Bessie?"
0xF608BAB1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0x4C2998BD
others."
0xB080C926

0x8D5AA8FB
"You don't show it."
0xB9DF2657

0x8D5AA8FB
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xA673BFB6
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x0418563B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x4F595EF1
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0xD6CD4FE9
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x0E4112DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0x76ECDEDC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x63EF6621

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0xE53BB726
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0x0A797CFF
you'd _rather_ not."
0xB82CAF31

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0x2D2B3B94
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x07F44C20
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xA4A2F8DC
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x418A276B
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0x28053709

CHAPTER V
0xC639AF7B

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x362BC48A
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x5AC4561E
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0xCDD0BB94
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0x1B4B2F6F
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xD55EAE63
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x44B5A1DC
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0xDDB7AF14
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x04C4429D
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0x4878249C
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0x92C2D5E0
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0x1B93FF52
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x689B6314
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xA2DFA2C5
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x18C7683C
bye?"
0x322E785B

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x9C840946
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0xA2B1D540
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x63E0F850
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x247B7B98

0x8D5AA8FB
"What did you say, Miss?"
0xB37D0CB6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x04F8E574
the wall."
0x4C223F89

0x8D5AA8FB
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0xEA2E5875

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x63F85F39
been my foe."
0xC2DA4A04

0x8D5AA8FB
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0x6DC78AFF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xB9710EE7
out at the front door.
0x122D9550

0x8D5AA8FB
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x2527CB29
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x2F849B6B
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0x80A134A0
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x5EB08AFF
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0xB3F7873B
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x77B1A3AE
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0xE1EB4379
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0x109B28D5
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0xAE464406

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x618FE3C4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And how far is it?"
0x81CE1BCA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fifty miles."
0x389C09E2

0x8D5AA8FB
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0xB264F3AE
alone."
0x75F7D324

0x8D5AA8FB
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xED8EC77C
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x6293FCD8
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0xFB1D6580
with kisses.
0xC76D487A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0xD34CACD5
me into the inside.
0xCF55392C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xB322555D
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0x71972E48
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x872618C8
mysterious regions.
0xDBA55B99

0x8D5AA8FB
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0xF8C17BCB
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x4F7F66E8
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x4EA1F8F4
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xBB2B07DD
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x95DF8BAB
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0xD639D629
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xC6617543
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x60B623F8
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x42702444
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x626073C3
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0xF4E3C49D
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xCCCA0583
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0xB7F88790
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0x4A7EFA9D
"stony street" of L-.
0x3D71F1FD

0x8D5AA8FB
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x06D93EA8
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0xE3689940
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x731FD7CB
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0x626EC1C9
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x7FBF79EF
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x3AA9E137

0x8D5AA8FB
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x5C728CAC
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x7E6C5C0B
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0xDB7D449A
by the light of the lamps.
0x9FCB75FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0xD80B5FF9
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x769A5549
instantly drove away.
0x716E97F0

0x8D5AA8FB
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x9F4660D4
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x1DF3C5BB
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x0D69E683
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x5EFA8441
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x0671465C
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x51378039
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xA09A641A
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0xE90DBB75
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x3AD4FF91

0x8D5AA8FB
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x89401F78
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xDF66B852
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x512A59A9
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0xF9606B90
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x8072C19E
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x60E2A084
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0xE100EA55

0x8D5AA8FB
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0x56172E83
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0xB6061A52
grave, her bearing erect.
0xBEC46C31

0x8D5AA8FB
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0x11ECB223
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0xC2B90E19
then further added--
0x8EF04316

0x8D5AA8FB
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xAA555D72
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0xA01F1C1F

0x8D5AA8FB
"A little, ma'am."
0xD1ED76A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x2CA1DE27
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0xD0633636
come to school, my little girl?"
0x521FE520

0x8D5AA8FB
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x8D7C6F3F
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0xB8B6AD75
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0xA5495668
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0xF2A989B0
me along with Miss Miller.
0xC8B289EF

0x8D5AA8FB
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0xACB0A1AD
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0xDD8E8905
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x386FDA52
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x2BD46956
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0x3145A0B0
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0x6E67EC8E
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0xCAA1CB24
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x92317EDA
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0xF49499F5
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0xDE4DD467
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0xE197BE31
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0xE18E66FD
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x9193FA33
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x82C3F52A
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x03A236EC
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x1059FCA8
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x481F12F2
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x38F043A3

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0xA648CDA3
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x8DCF7317

0x8D5AA8FB
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xF6647693

0x8D5AA8FB
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0x2AD747DF
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x04C9F993

0x8D5AA8FB
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0xCE0225B7

0x8D5AA8FB
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x0426CC29
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x1CD532A0
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xC620C015
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0xB6377F43
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x670A887B
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x344274BE
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x2F4381FF

0x8D5AA8FB
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x2D6BB2F4
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x3FFA3E23
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0xA5D0547B
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x7C7C95B4
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x281B77CE
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x71F83E77
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0xD39B2733
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0xEA0E18A1

0x8D5AA8FB
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x2FC71922
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0xCF2BECB4
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x3C268664
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x870630FD
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x6F77A70E
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0xA65D5B88
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x2D069BF0
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0xEDA5C223
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x4211EA78
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x7143B3CC
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0xAEB64410
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x7B3E2F59

0x8D5AA8FB
"Form classes!"
0x22C822AF

0x8D5AA8FB
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0xB94C14C3
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x1F2AA0F6
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x0D5B23BD
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xF219D4F5
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0xFEA909DC
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0x63DA1935
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x228302B5

0x8D5AA8FB
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x5B910391
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0xC82326E8
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0xC2D737D4
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xA8818695
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x963B7236

0x8D5AA8FB
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0xB47C4091
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0xFB18CF9E
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0xD2E569FF
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0x52347439
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0xCE353C26
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0xDD3D54D1
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x0D9783C8
little the day before.
0x0DAC020A

0x8D5AA8FB
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x11A503DF
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0xF6E7A7A6
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0xDC88C98E
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x3172C7CF
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x7FC9C251
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0xFAC09BDA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x38635761

0x8D5AA8FB
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0xDD73DE7F
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x279E44C7
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xBC823A7B
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x430F599E
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x9879759C
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x837BF941
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x85B96A70
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0xF1C0B086
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x6FA7FA5B
the meal began.
0xF2D957A0

0x8D5AA8FB
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0xAB2CA7EC
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x1A4F6819
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x51D5E63A
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0xB7AA910C
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xE21352C3
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0xAC5E43AB
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0xE49E6C1B
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xEE852EA0
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0xEC100E96
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x507B422C
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x3B278163
them, the stout one, whispered--
0xF651DC2C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x9F52ECE3

0x8D5AA8FB
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0xAD7FAD93
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x0DDFEE97
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0x4EC42DA6
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x2B4B3EDD
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x52D18A74
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0xF1280ED6
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0x62EEBE29
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x8F342172
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x8CFCAC6B
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x8D976989

0x8D5AA8FB
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x8C199616
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x66078EFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x09868E3C

0x8D5AA8FB
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xDEFAFD67
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x5742134B
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x761EDFF8
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0xD26CB1BB
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x815485CA
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x5FC227C8
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xE8DEEFBD
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0xA3A5B4E5
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0xA6716713
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0xFF0A8542
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0xC3A160B8
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0x06D75433
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x40C9D691

0x8D5AA8FB
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0xEB4624AE
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x8D6C3912
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x562E3CAF
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x91EEBDB9
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0xF548E3DC
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0xD0D593D6

0x8D5AA8FB
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x1C7B12CC
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0xEFB299BE
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0xD80057F7
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x5B58710E
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0x7EDB8A5D
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x36D91342
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0xEC64941A
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0xAC24BDDE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x94A0B002

0x8D5AA8FB
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x9CDF14E7
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xDA316E45
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0xF38A9071
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0xEAE8A996
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0x4C58BEBA
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xD53A7A08
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x2C93B52E
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0xA6FAB6DC
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0x9970133F
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0xEBADAE9D
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0xC164D74F
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0x63A554A9
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xE862AD6B
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x8D25C1A7
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0xC4D6D413
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0xADAFE7DF

0x8D5AA8FB
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0xCF005214
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0x440572AF
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x8C13839A
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0xC7A49E34
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x014ACC5F
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x90E54457
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xEB2EA173
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x8856ECF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0x5A997FFB

0x8D5AA8FB
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x4B911F5C
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x564635F3

0x8D5AA8FB
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x94BB2CDB
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x9A921E7A
to all."
0x606EFBB3

0x8D5AA8FB
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x4E0123B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x6552C112
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xC1530829

0x8D5AA8FB
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0xC36AA93E
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x92044DB4
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x2EA3C9BA
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x9E0EBFC6
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x55C73F37

0x8D5AA8FB
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x5650CD83
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x90409B84
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0xD398A23E
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0xFA51D42E
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0xA143D2C9
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0x8A5EF3D5
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xE93CDEB5
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0xE974A54D
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xDA87B8A5
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x72C4F6C7
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xA56B0014
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x1DD91AD5
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0x38E19BD5
hollow cough.
0x2A4DF881

0x8D5AA8FB
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x833F69D6
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0x7F56B10D
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x10649BF9
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0x6C8737BF
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0x4F0020BA
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x37E9DA28
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x1EE1ABB0
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x8E66DDC2
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0xA2D2F975
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x721A77FE
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0xD4412B93
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0xB246D554
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xB32D3ECD
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0x2B2E9A31
this inscription:--
0xD3C2B450

0x8D5AA8FB
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0xF01FD233
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x93A95DD5
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0xEC0D3987
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x2B552E0E

0x8D5AA8FB
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x64482D17
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x280A18E4
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0xCFFCA4A5
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0xBA5CA336
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x7BEE4D35
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0xE649BCB8
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x23D76A00
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0x702A9236
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x32B352AF
I said to her directly--
0xB7F88DF3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0x7F7825D0
her to lend it to me some day.
0xB1184483

0x8D5AA8FB
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x2644DE36
she examined me.
0x2E871ECE

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0xB40C7448
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0xEDF68E3D
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0xC360642B
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x3686B1DC
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0xADE3D81B
or substantial.
0x69259989

0x8D5AA8FB
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x1FCCA503

0x8D5AA8FB
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0xCE67B294
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0xA62294B9
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0xC6117B82
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0xFE7EF372
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x68B6B896
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xDD80482A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0x727B9DF3
is Lowood Institution?"
0xCC242FA7

0x8D5AA8FB
"This house where you are come to live."
0x3D67C332

0x8D5AA8FB
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0x3E1829EA
other schools?"
0x1902B160

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0x6301AFB2
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0xAB9C544E
father or your mother dead?"
0x27B6EC61

0x8D5AA8FB
"Both died before I can remember."
0x1AD7EAD8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0x8493105E
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0x449B7233

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0x78A7CD7B

0x8D5AA8FB
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0xD95BF296

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0x5CEB2270

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0xA716BDAC
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0xE2621FAC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who subscribes?"
0x154A26A0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0xC7BF1B29
and in London."
0xB724D5B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0x7473C957

0x8D5AA8FB
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0x4BF8B560
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0x4ACFF5B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?"
0x9052B961

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x69D47630

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x195AC3A4
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0xB02706AE

0x8D5AA8FB
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0x14D3D8D1
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x1619773B
all our clothes."
0xFF6A146C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Does he live here?"
0xC60DCD52

0x8D5AA8FB
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0x1D39FD28

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is he a good man?"
0x2D204C04

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0x53FE6D68

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0xBD594A03

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0x9D3C8C9C

0x8D5AA8FB
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0xA3A1D198
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0xE6B059FB
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0xED2B44C6
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0xB7AA4CEF
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0x4F7FBDC1
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0x6ECB36E2
teaches French."
0x7D58E311

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x669A0213

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well enough."
0xFFE7ED54

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x5A09C940
pronounce her name as you do."
0x4CE50597

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0xDE921DA5
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0x1766C8B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x77B72533

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0x35734156
she knows far more than they do."
0xB0E60448

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you been long here?"
0x757B3FA4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Two years."
0xB6B0020B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you an orphan?"
0x7DB674DD

0x8D5AA8FB
"My mother is dead."
0x7CD0AE0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you happy here?"
0xF8611E2D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x161827CB
the present: now I want to read."
0x13F1A802

0x8D5AA8FB
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xACDFAF15
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x2F7F45A0
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0x199E6220
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x850D4721
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x959C4C5E
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0xA76765B7
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x75211616
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x951740C2
day's fare would be like this.
0x5DDD7C22

0x8D5AA8FB
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0xC24E49E0
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0xF6819BED

0x8D5AA8FB
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x3DE86BE8
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0xF54BA265
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x2F7FD242
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0xAAB21735
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x8199791F
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x37FB6D36
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x8E08BF1E
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0x4B0AFBFB
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x6BB5BA71
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0xD325286A
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x27D44FCE
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0xF6179DBB
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xDA3FA094
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x6FBEFE3B
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x08CFB54B
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xA6615CFE

0x8D5AA8FB
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xCAAF4531
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xF5A0B49E
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x2B0FE593
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0xAF267767
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x454D563B
first day at Lowood.
0x51C20E83

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER VI
0xCFDE23A4

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0x4B9284EC
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0xB200A60D
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0xAFF9DAB7
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0xED3BD984
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0xB23B04FB
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xFEBBBCBE

0x8D5AA8FB
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x3C7D2056
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0x0F7A95D5
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x2F4EBC7F
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0xE8B033E2

0x8D5AA8FB
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x9D7640A3
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x20CEE220
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0xAB4AD686
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xF7539805
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x7F8A2A01
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x5F1916CD
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0xA401D3FA
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x1E723DF6
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x3FBFB243
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0xEAEBFEEF
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0xCCF6EA0E
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x1C97E7C0
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0x7CA1536C
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0xF24CD38C
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x84B4D9B3
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0xBD076A4E
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xB636A645
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0xD9C2B371
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x64A4F2F9
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0xFF600FFA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0xC3F34D9F
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0x73BF7B35
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x0ABB452B
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0xBAF83A5B
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0xC665DD9B
&c. &c.
0x885BB6F6

0x8D5AA8FB
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0xB3D8AD17
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0xF66C855A
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0x156EAE70
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0x6564127A
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0xF588AA3B
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xD5BCAD92
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0x73FC81B7
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x3A6BFE67

0x8D5AA8FB
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0xCA008A61
morning!"
0x7EB43198

0x8D5AA8FB
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0xBDF7C863
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x376939A1
as the water was frozen?"
0x6C5F9B4B

0x8D5AA8FB
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0x4FDFE334
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0xDBF653EC
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0x1CBA0AF1
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x70E4EBBA
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x6537F3DB
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xB8C1FA1C
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0xA3C6139A
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x9D34DB1A
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0x04953632
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xD4E5C4BA
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xA2817CDB
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0x6F83A344
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x87898FF6
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x7C2649D0
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x68C821BC
altered its ordinary expression.
0x79B4236B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x320E666D
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x7A5A1566

0x8D5AA8FB
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x6EDBAA5B
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x87C19301
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x79C25DB2

0x8D5AA8FB
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x5318D3D4
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0x918343A6
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0xB68005A8
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x88C362D4
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x43E0DD2D
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x5F597BE3
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x1DBDE52C
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xB8AF975F

0x8D5AA8FB
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x0B7EDE38
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x75A8BBE0
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0x8211CC39
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x176FA511
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0xF439348D
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x64513213
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x49AEB45F

0x8D5AA8FB
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0xDB1D43C3
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0xD1F145B4
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x15CB69F0
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x93574637
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x2D55AA37
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xAD4D308E
to clamour.
0xF9827970

0x8D5AA8FB
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x9239BABF
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x85CDCF52
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x830A12CB
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0x4DAC1EA9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x5701BFE3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x58257563

0x8D5AA8FB
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x0DD04860
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x5A6852B2
floor.
0xF6933B62

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x91619FF8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Helen."
0x280543DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x0F53C184

0x8D5AA8FB
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0xBE25D876

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you ever go back?"
0x2EEB779C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x31039BBF

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x7D3E7015

0x8D5AA8FB
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x7CA62120
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0xC806B616

0x8D5AA8FB
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0xA61D1DC2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0xC7779282

0x8D5AA8FB
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0xD538E600
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x5683144E
break it under her nose."
0xBD2E3809

0x8D5AA8FB
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x93EEB429
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x3527369E
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0x63DF58B2
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x3FD6D8B3
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x2E01A9B0
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0xF80C3C19

0x8D5AA8FB
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0x6F58E249
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0x3961CB23
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0x4C10A593

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x6142C05C
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x4F2D268C
required to bear."
0xEA731A35

0x8D5AA8FB
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0x08350AE8
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0xCC3854C9
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0xBE0293CB
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x87E922C4
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x6B1B2DF6
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0xE6964830

0x8D5AA8FB
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0x741217DE
good."
0x57C01B00

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x1BC51320
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x90447257
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xB3B24CC1
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x62689AAF
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0xAD8030A7
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0x1877F43D

0x8D5AA8FB
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0x1BCF63EE
addition: she kept silence.
0x1E658939

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x43BD55C1

0x8D5AA8FB
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x1367D8A4
grave face.
0x27108809

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x2AE8A2B1
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x6296802A
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x0340AE25
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x0BA16994
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0xA717D0DA
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0x10CF9539
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0x350F0C4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x26FDBDA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0xD580CA79
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0xBEE65A3B
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0x8535D9FB
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x6AD85A6D
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xFFAAF1F4
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0xF924E955
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0x4AA95CE1
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0xF2068F97
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0x417ABEC1
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x62238AB7
answer ready."
0x28897B16

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x051699B4

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0x6FA34D41
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x3DADA74D
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0xE1C34E8F
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0xDBCC20CE
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0x58DC2016
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x6574E24F
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x66E90E8D
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0xE612BFE6
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x529AED37
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0x958F232B

0x8D5AA8FB
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0xE06B836C
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0xCFA002DC
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0xD5270520

0x8D5AA8FB
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0xA86D075A

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x979BECA3
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0xC32D3CCF
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x959386A5
I wished to gain."
0xF30806B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0xDED71DCC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0xF2404AB2
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0x2E2091D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x1F32AF9D
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x63D92711
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x7C54EAC1
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0x2E21E511
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x6ECCB432
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x277F9C48
person who struck us never to do it again."
0x0DC010B6

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0x8A2DCC69
but a little untaught girl."
0x93AB9AD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x82FF8A4D
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0xC618D294
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0x627A19EF
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0xAD630F91

0x8D5AA8FB
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0xBC3E9DBE
civilised nations disown it."
0x04CEF9F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"How?  I don't understand."
0x6882E4B6

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0xFFCEBA80
certainly heals injury."
0xEC95A2EE

0x8D5AA8FB
"What then?"
0x15E042F9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0x9E798846
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0x568E95FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"What does He say?"
0x856668DF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0x1781F46E
you and despitefully use you."
0x30D1982A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0x33A0BC96
John, which is impossible."
0xC931F3F9

0x8D5AA8FB
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0xB29D1096
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0xFCC72599
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x1265593B
softening.
0xACB94621

0x8D5AA8FB
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0xFE7D5ABD
remark, but she said nothing.
0xD242F359

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0xEE3AE158
woman?"
0x186BADE9

0x8D5AA8FB
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0x308F1B1B
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x8832C451
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x51703B39
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0xF9858981
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0x4C2ECA8E
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xAC0D33BB
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x88EDEB47
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x5A4818F2
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0xEA16C3C4
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xE821FC71
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0xEB092B9C
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x658D3867
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x8C3FE7BF
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x8C5F90AF
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0xA54EFE0E
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x70ADB3F0
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0x6EB345CF
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x006882C5
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0x7C28775D
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xC8AF7163
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0x2F37EA19
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x3D3DEAC0
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0xCAD4C18F
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0xF87E913C
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x34F49679

0x8D5AA8FB
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0xDFDBC69D
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xEF6AAEC1
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0xF93C7CEF
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x1BACF07E
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0x39BF52C8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x8C3BF5F7
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x09A1FE9C

0x8D5AA8FB
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x213AAE87
without reply as without delay.
0xABB15152

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER VII
0xFB91A214

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x715FA363
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x1E700B41
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x678157B7
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0xC3438966
were no trifles.
0xA7C70619

0x8D5AA8FB
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0x163E056D
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0xCAE70E76
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x7C74B1D4
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0xB8AF9AA8
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x90352730
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x4A671A57
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x53EE37F8
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x8E185C30
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x285C30AA
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x649BA3F9
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0x791D0858
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0xB75A891A
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x03806AAC
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0xB3BC06B7
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0x22637853
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0xED305604
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0xB77D806D
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x9CECFC79
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x3D1D7FC1

0x8D5AA8FB
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x5DDE3659
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0xE2BA0334
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x671CC48A
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0xF4DB6C9A
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x4E830A63
meals, was served round between the services.
0x80951A7F

0x8D5AA8FB
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x8FA7D20B
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0x7E2E426C
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x2131B768

0x8D5AA8FB
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x871980CC
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0x414A8533
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x1E49AD38
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x48703661
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x867CD05B
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x0AD911DD

0x8D5AA8FB
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0x0F7BDF34
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x9B7B4892
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0x61076341
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xB696DA64
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x58D7DE47

0x8D5AA8FB
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x0DC41EE9
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0xC5193EB8
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0x73F965A5
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x0E4F7605
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x557885B0
invariably obliged to part with.
0x6999BBE9

0x8D5AA8FB
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0xB402952A
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0xEAB1FB2A
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xADF094CD
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0xFE3ED0C2
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x57BA4299
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x121F0AEE
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0xF1ED1BBE
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x0362E059
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0xEEBCD356
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x493BD652
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xF282394A

0x8D5AA8FB
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0xF12B5E7B
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0xED1B7E14
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0xFB9BB0DD
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0xF8597503
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x6E7E2702

0x8D5AA8FB
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0x6FF1C8BC
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xB96A73CD
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x24CB0159
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x0688FD0E
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0xF7D1A1B8
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0xAF1BC0C3
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0xED8F9590
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0xDD0A03FF
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xC0DCE77B
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x9E7A78E8
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x85649DB2
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x76FC444A

0x8D5AA8FB
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xB14B1EDE
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x77D529F5
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0x707406B1
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xC6923806
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0xF2E8158E
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x697EC648
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x5027611B

0x8D5AA8FB
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0xCF2346BE
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0xD95272DD
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0xD0BFF3CE
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xD43ACC95
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0xAF003F7B
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xB4BF9C0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x95645C40
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x3455C93B
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x8B3232FC
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x92FE5836
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0x70163A2F
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x60427016
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0xE912B7CC
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x69EA4D38
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x63E4D383
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x81B56414
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0x459564DD

0x8D5AA8FB
He paused.
0x203B9884

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x9738DC4E

0x8D5AA8FB
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0x4DC60989
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x90DDB2CD
to one."
0xAB134358

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0xC7F78525
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0x75185DDC
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0xDCB9C506
occasion."
0x699990F8

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x9889FB9F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0x090A4E00
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x59477F84
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0xC3905DFE
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x7F13E8D9
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x7B7422FE
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0xF5CE0D19
what authority?"
0xC2FD476B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xD1C3D5CE
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x4C9BD116
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0xC3F04107

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0xB56470EB
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x0CF899C2
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x664649A5
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x8E454527
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0xEABC3351
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0x1C3F839A
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x1C2B424C
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x42EFD43C
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0x8017FFB6
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0x548DDBD4
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x61B1ED1F
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0x0A2AE097
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x4AAAF802
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0xB564D040
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0x87125444
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0xAB876D2E
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0xE77B047C
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0xD1942BFE
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0xEEDEB745

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0xF351D4F7
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x793722D5
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x349254F6
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0xB632DE03
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0x3B2F37C3
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0xC846932B
severity.
0x1D69229E

0x8D5AA8FB
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xDC9F71B9
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x2C90275C
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x9B022998
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xE9B02E6A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0xB53DFC3E
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0xDF3303DA
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0xEB606B97

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x82694B86

0x8D5AA8FB
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0xB16CC300
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x80B26052
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xFEBD43D3
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0xC869D445

0x8D5AA8FB
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x009FA3C4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0xC03A78B3
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x38CF7D0C
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x43150F5C
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x6D60CEA1
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x0F0A8733
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x3607710B
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0xEE9FDEC6

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x8DF874CC
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x0BA6E3E7
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0xAF99789E
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0xFFAB663D
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x17284AD3
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0xCFA38046
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x2B262E4A
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x6EDE0F07

0x8D5AA8FB
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x0E74A004
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0xDACA72F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0xFE18FE7B

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0xFDC41D8F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0x3AA6C6AF
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x1892F428
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0xB67DDD42
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0x5BB7A350
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0xF946A95C
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x4B50D8F7
time wasted, of--"
0x08F87228

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x023386E8
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0xFEB10B14
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x708986B5
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x75A159AE
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x6036CE95
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x445367C9
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0xC760AAF0
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x0245A70F
false front of French curls.
0x33C504B4

0x8D5AA8FB
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x7D868CC5
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0xB570FEB9
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x4920CEC9
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0xED9960FB
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0xFBC55872
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0xC2BFC727
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x636BF25C
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0x4BFD2AA7
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x169A211F
my attention.
0xE2327C4E

0x8D5AA8FB
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x7A4DB15E
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x0EC7A402
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x41807804
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0x948A5E3C
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x8C6FC95A
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0xA166A2D0
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0x98DEEB4A
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xE6056628
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x7CB31F75
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x8C54F36E

0x8D5AA8FB
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x5EEA6077
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x9A2C0717
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x4FE2F3FB
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x866B1E82

0x8D5AA8FB
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x4F083C25
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x2D6EE673
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0xBCC44D7A
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xBD704207

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0x7A1B7F19
punished."
0x64152DC3

0x8D5AA8FB
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x5E1BC290

0x8D5AA8FB
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x4EF06FA7
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x14C4BB01
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0xC6627044

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x02D299FB
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x9BE25F6D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Place the child upon it."
0xA105AEC6

0x8D5AA8FB
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0xBEB8AA71
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x27BFCFA5
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0x85E19709
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0xD8BD9802
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x168BF508

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x0F09DD2A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x18C01D83
children, you all see this girl?"
0x08BA830D

0x8D5AA8FB
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x076C851E
against my scorched skin.
0x5472BF61

0x8D5AA8FB
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x10FD600B
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x894F6ADD
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x00F14A6E
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0xB72D32DA
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0xE1D20E63

0x8D5AA8FB
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0x64066A0F
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xE60CB744
must be firmly sustained.
0x43370FF4

0x8D5AA8FB
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0x5F485945
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0xB6695662
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0xBD3A88D7
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xE252D82D
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x874B3C72
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x21497BEC
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x6A2E6413
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0xF2253013
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xA9B6EE20
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x04C63DBB
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x33E68161
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x11EBDAEC

0x8D5AA8FB
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0xB0B73A4A
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x02B70BDF
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0xA63DFD7A
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x885C5523
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xF99ED663

0x8D5AA8FB
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0xE5DB5453
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0x63EF633A
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xB95C6BAC
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xD4F875C6
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x8A267044
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0xFA49B5FB
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x9B66A5EB
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0xE2C115CC
waters to stagnate round her."
0x82A3C71B

0x8D5AA8FB
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x8F2A18DC
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0xD24005BE
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x94C4C67F
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0xDBC82962

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x9CF6E951
her during the remainder of the day."
0xA2990D8F

0x8D5AA8FB
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x4506C4B9
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x3C610B98
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0xD6375EAA
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0xAC70B11E
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x7BD4FCCC
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0xCD0CC831
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xD8F852A8
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0xCBC9DEBE
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0xF397D230
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x906DA6B9
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x572FE6E4
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x35C658EF
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x9D9D96C7
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0xED48D320
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x5179B9E7
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0xD802046D
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0xA1A8F52D
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0x04005666
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0xE13C2939
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xBE9A813C
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x6235F7EE
the full brightness of the orb.
0x0411BFBC

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER VIII
0x4A3522B2

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x522AA31E
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x6C5B903C
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x3FFCD41B
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x3D442E49
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0xA4A88D39
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xBD27B5FE
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0xF3DBCADD
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x439F74AE
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x0F3F8F7F
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0xAA5B8063
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x6693E6F8
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x748FB5CD
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x2AD4EED5
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x6915CD72
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0x261A3419
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xE80A2437

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x7DB5F530
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x58A296DF
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0xD45D25D4
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x05619C0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x9321911B
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0xD2B8C530
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x2801F45F
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x7266E91D
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0x03BF7FAF
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0x06FCF268
first who spoke--
0x144F689E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0x3B37133B
liar?"
0xEA2FEA0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0xAAD81F32
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x3434A1F9

0x8D5AA8FB
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xB0DC70B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x2FDEA363
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0xA17214FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0xCE91ECB2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x639B0AD5
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x95C3BFBF
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x70235127
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0xEF381046
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0xE52CDE42
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0xFFBF3D19
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x9BC94130
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x74CF8555
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x1A472015

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x02DE0599
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xE6BF4CAB

0x8D5AA8FB
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0xD5CA0F5F
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0xB04382D6
without friends."
0x75797170

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x61D1C04D
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x86D0BCFB
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xE095FD1D
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0xCC1A926B
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0xBC7BA280
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x0509B417

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0xFD461D63
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0xF3C4C9D1
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x99018DAA
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x63FA4C42
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x0AB08250
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0xAF35E317
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x5CB8BCEB
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0xCDB7A9BE
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x46F239C0
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0xF812ACF6
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0xF6CA12F0
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0x3AC06253
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x05286C9D
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0x8E2D25E7
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0x6E2FEA2A

0x8D5AA8FB
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x81A6B001
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x374DEED6
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xB12EF985
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0xB18C49A6
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x0FAAA92F

0x8D5AA8FB
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0xCD2C240E
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x97A1CF79
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x4F3235F9
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0xA3F4C596
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0x374387F0
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x1A13C3E7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xE98F4D76
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0xFD6B8ACC

0x8D5AA8FB
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x5EC59DA6
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x539B340B
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0x150EB498
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x63F2B5BE
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0xE6548380

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x973857B1
your grief away?"
0x634BCEC7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0x47035EDD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?"
0x9052B961

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x6E3C7917
will now think me wicked."
0xF55D54BE

0x8D5AA8FB
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x94341767
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0x338F3B4E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x6E6CB2E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0x2187678D
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x458F35C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0xC83E144C
care."
0x15576D6D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x87020200

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xEC91F33A
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0xEC014DEB
always keep me."
0xC681464B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xC4677D73
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x25FB3E26
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x186B2D13
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0xE115D5DD
exaggerate nothing."
0xCE8DC74B

0x8D5AA8FB
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x9B5B2C14
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0xDA648C8B
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0xF79C36F2
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x8B2BF651
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0x89534647
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x8355042F
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xFA541B4F
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0xEA6052CD
Temple fully believed me.
0x663E995C

0x8D5AA8FB
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0xC188F3DD
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xF5895DCB
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0xA7E631C7
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x7D635BB2
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x4C4F5921
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x9E36988B

0x8D5AA8FB
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0xF6233EDC
then said--
0xF7B41E1E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x3D46CF3A
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x0E388442
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x92C24D4B

0x8D5AA8FB
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x6B29D064
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0xDE8C3265
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x5A6C9A08
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0xF3AAB9B0
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0x9800BEFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0xAE9F02E2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x3AAF2D6B

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x1BABE59D

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a little better."
0x2CD6AE77

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x454466A0
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xF4CA2876
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0xD361717A

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0x6ADB1DD2
rang her bell.
0x27FD9B76

0x8D5AA8FB
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x3AB5274C
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x27189CA6

0x8D5AA8FB
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xE9E97F3F
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0xD47F6E4E
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0xAE083B10
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x2C904742
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x5F6760FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xD9549B23
There is not enough for three."
0x1E792CB8

0x8D5AA8FB
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xF5B0D9DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x78536210

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x297C567F
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x838DAB08

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x59B1E8FB
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x8DAA093C
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x20380D52

0x8D5AA8FB
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x386272B6
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xBD4D0872
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x180EC154
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x21942DDF

0x8D5AA8FB
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0xCA8FDDB5
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x6ABD98C7
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0xE675BDE8

0x8D5AA8FB
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x48E139A3
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x22E757E5
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x6A409205
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x96FB0823

0x8D5AA8FB
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xE2AB9B75
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0x2A1B85D5
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0x9683330A

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x1604D1E6
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x14A21A04
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x4D011421
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x0953993D
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0xA581CE1D
struck with wonder.
0x2C818598

0x8D5AA8FB
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x5F75EE13
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0xBF876146
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0x53588D5B
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0x4EC5F364
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x032B0165
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0xC221072A
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x9406EDF7
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0x81A00757
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0xF8FD80DE
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x74D5A03F
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0x34508B30
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0x0A59FFA9
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x60FBC55C
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x5497398B

0x8D5AA8FB
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x83A89333
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0xB506BE4D
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x6756ABDC
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0xF3827E1E
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x5752A77D
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0x3E063DE9
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0xE3D606AF
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x147F7008
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x2329E5A1
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0x5CF0919F
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x58BC0A64

0x8D5AA8FB
"God bless you, my children!"
0xBCFB4D89

0x8D5AA8FB
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0x9009C945
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0xE0EE215E
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x71BA0D92

0x8D5AA8FB
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x6F7AECD2
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x1F47148D
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x3C6CBAB4
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0xA509DD20
shoulder.
0xC6DB4077

0x8D5AA8FB
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x0F641C40
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x432D9DD6

0x8D5AA8FB
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x27EE05E9
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x7F118770
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x6D3E8BDF
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x7DFD5473
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0xF504DF60
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0x3EFD63DB
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x6F5249CE
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x56C0F547
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0xAB72F4CA

0x8D5AA8FB
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x918D1CF0
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x28E3D0A1
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0xF2EACE63
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x0E6924E8
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xCE29AA88
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x249D9DAB
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x08A22C69
through the ranks of my companions.
0x7E53D4BA

0x8D5AA8FB
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0xEE46BA01
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0x90B98E21
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0xE69A5DE3
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x7B3562AF
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x48C81A72
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x4FD9883D
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x0575BED5
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0xDE3626A9
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0xB344FDAF
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x8FEA2829
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x3E3B208B
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0xA6F3AAC0
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0xF502D521
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0xE1B884CB
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0xDC2DCC7E
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0x46BD6C79
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xE742BB8B
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x9645D543
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x48BD0062
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0x5C80B30D

0x8D5AA8FB
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0x58FFABB8
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x9839BA81

0x8D5AA8FB
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0x6995DC43
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
0xE1149135

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER IX
0xD329D6EF

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x5313352D
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0xBD847566
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xC09CE9B6
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0xEB4D920C
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x196939BA
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x98CA0FAD
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x11005DA8
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0xFDF5B0DC
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0xD051C525
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x6620AA1E
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x66A83175
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x1BF11E44
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x19287F09
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x1D651C7C

0x8D5AA8FB
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0x952A105F
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x1B44CEC6
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x41DCF3CA
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x6F3617B3
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x3764E42F
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x940E1E36
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x5100D27F
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xA97A3728
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0xAD563252
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x88544FE4
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x64E54CB8
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0xBDE5F2A3
of skeletons.
0x49BF1E56

0x8D5AA8FB
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0xCC4D9FC6
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x8E2CF9FD
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x1E94ACAC
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0xD7A85415
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x456A5170
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xE9573F4B
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0x23423AE1
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xA44DAEA1
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x7A80E367
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x2B816B33
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0xE4DA2A5F
advert.
0x7043E84B

0x8D5AA8FB
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x33DF2A5B
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x467D3B1E
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0x43DB4EF3
question.
0x340F069F

0x8D5AA8FB
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0xF930DB24
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xDDF541E7
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x37F051C6
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x009FAC55
hospital.
0x458C1572

0x8D5AA8FB
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x956E9927
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x1AF77C04
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0xA883A40B
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xAC54CC79
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x55E49D33
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0xFFCC4951
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x5EF97ADF
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0xAF7200EA
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0xE4B94DBE
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x8C2C46C0
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xC99F3456
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x87733058
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0x133CD76C
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x1B80ABEF

0x8D5AA8FB
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x05C92433
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x706F7C48
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x2FB1C815
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0xE7585867
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0xD2772BCA
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0x1867E0DD
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0xD04E7B40
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0xA64E66B2
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x1150917D
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0xA9C9F989
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xF158FC11
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0x6F296FA2

0x8D5AA8FB
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x1E2F3644
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0xB98B48B7
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0xC8A4B9FD
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x62E7CD39
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xC2021B4A
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x9ECAE9D2
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x45C35371
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0xC125910E
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0xE8D3DED0
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x9423D6E6
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x28A8E017
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x19F59AE2
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x53A8ED22

0x8D5AA8FB
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0xD4C19B9D
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x437EB689
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xFA5A9DE9
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x525CCE0D
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xD982C519
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0x1B9493A8
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x184F5CF7
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x4FAC02A7
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x6B728F10
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0xB6343F97
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x5380F099
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x7C94B92C
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x0CB796E9

0x8D5AA8FB
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x7A21A6FB
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0x17C0CF28
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x87DFC949
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x799052F5
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x0C1A0CB6
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0xF22F548F
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x6A41AE69
higher things.
0x8AF58B7F

0x8D5AA8FB
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x9E427B24
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0x7E709997
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x343BBD61
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x09957E15
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x2A6AA0F5
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0xA2A0BE86
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x3B19301A
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0x0C0706DC
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0xD60EC566
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x3DD36641
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x37E1E69E
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x55596BC0
alleviate.
0x88540189

0x8D5AA8FB
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0x4907397C
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x959C3D36
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x2F2C4045
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0x7C9B6C67
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0xB14F7C0D
verandah.
0xF67A2904

0x8D5AA8FB
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x67C3DDAA
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0xA0C91A69
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0xEA2F17DA
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x7794C6C5
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0x5D61E558
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x535901AE
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0xEF642CF9
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x85D9ECA1
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x2636B41E
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x5656A31C
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x6B8EE23F
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x7B794345
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xEF1EC6AC
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x3A64936B
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0xC857A8CD
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x0F37CCD5
done before:--
0x35B818A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0xF77DE613
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x0687635D
have to go who knows where?"
0xB85E2993

0x8D5AA8FB
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x1640E464
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x970E3240
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0xEEB94607
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0xC6F07FE6
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x271BF5DE
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x687001D2
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x377996A2
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x9F8EDF94
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0xDCB95C71
ran up to her.
0x361A5642

0x8D5AA8FB
"How is Helen Burns?"
0xD4B48B42

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xD826F006

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x4CEE6864

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what does he say about her?"
0x3CC391D5

0x8D5AA8FB
"He says she'll not be here long."
0xCEFEED47

0x8D5AA8FB
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0x96AB44B3
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x10248161
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xC8F9D299
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0xCE6AB759
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xCA3ABBC2
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xB08458F3
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x345187FE
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x8272E022

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0xC79CD1AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x98CF8E64

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x70BAF387
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x09FD7F3E

0x8D5AA8FB
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x39ADB3BD
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x81EE31F5
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0x507D05D7

0x8D5AA8FB
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x69116EE2
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x550F7D28
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x1B84788E
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x0E551F13
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x4CC9BD5D
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x61A6BFDF
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x118ED337
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x1FD7C15C
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0xD2D7FC3A
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x2C33CEF5
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0xEABACCA2
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0xE35A3AFA
with her one last word.
0x73AADE10

0x8D5AA8FB
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0xA6355B19
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0x1FF8D4F0
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0x1A982832
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0x09B11FB1
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x40D1B187
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0xBCB2F75C
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x2F2C4C49
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0xF6D823FE
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x33484307

0x8D5AA8FB
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x79FCD20B
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0xBE5CA9C0
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0xFA7CA316
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0xABA176CA
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0x08C5A3FA
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0xF26F3E7F
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x052D5E98
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xA3920786
of seeing a corpse.
0xAB3ED8A9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xBDD91E53

0x8D5AA8FB
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x4FE270A3
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x5612FD68
instantly dissipated.
0xEB14EADA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xF1EFF5F9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x82141DE5
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xB2B6272D

0x8D5AA8FB
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0x1FF4AF77
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0xE4BC27CA
old.
0x1B780290

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xC1E037D2
strike some minutes since."
0x0F29ED61

0x8D5AA8FB
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0xAA559BE9
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0xB9F96848

0x8D5AA8FB
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xCDE0852F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x6D96625A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0xF9E7A59C

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x946ABB56
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x9A81A937
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x0903B24A
whispered--
0x886FF5D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x6D2E5D0C
quilt."
0xDA0D6D9A

0x8D5AA8FB
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xE93E1EA9
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0x043532C8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xA85A3AA1
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x02346C4C
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x2918DE25
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x7D4059B1
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xFF69F1D9
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x370A692F
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0x1A681CF1
been continually at fault."
0xF8230583

0x8D5AA8FB
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0x2C56507D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0xC33A5FC4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x84E7A7D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0x2CEB8708
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0x87621492
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x30CB6359
reveal Him to me."
0xB9A3F48B

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0xF81A19C4
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0x49132B5C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0x47747C21
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x58CB1A07
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0x832FC368

0x8D5AA8FB
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x5CEB70C8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0x5D8FE283
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x55FF27E9

0x8D5AA8FB
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0xB72495B5
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x7D4B40ED
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0xFBF87601
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0x6744633A
tone--
0xC9A62C64

0x8D5AA8FB
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0xF238634D
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x9BB8614E
near me."
0x66B902D6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xC47C85BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you warm, darling?"
0x717631BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-night, Jane."
0x46457C90

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-night, Helen."
0xF01A7C18

0x8D5AA8FB
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0xE3094F38

0x8D5AA8FB
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x3C19464F
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x9558954A
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0xFEF96ADC
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x9B531993
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0x8CF15A83
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0x4A64D014
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x5EA9AA91
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0x2A1E5031

0x8D5AA8FB
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xF5AC10FA
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x73C97F07
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

CHAPTER X
0xBADA86B1

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x2DA9F255
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x35C7C22F
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0xE5E760BA
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x22FE5879
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x3FC63880
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0xE40CC6FF
connection.
0x9CA4439A

0x8D5AA8FB
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0x9D559AAD
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x501C51CF
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x5E89F039
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x0D8D4D31
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x79EA543D
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x2A1813CD
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x91573878
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0xF890A881
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0x8AF930AE
beneficial to the institution.
0x96B5D644

0x8D5AA8FB
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x84896940
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0xFB87D233
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x66DD2842
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0x16B37329
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0xB7CDDF13
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0xAB0E91D7
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0x5C840A98
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0x8DDF6A6B
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0xDC15100E
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x06C2EC0B
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0xFB83D46E
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xB17ACF88
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0xA3F1A1D4
testimony to its value and importance.
0x6D97A938

0x8D5AA8FB
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xD2EF70D9
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0xFF742338
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0x56A86FC3
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0xE15A252F
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0xD906802F
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0xEA406A63
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xE73E9E9F
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xB33BF464

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x65E72871
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0xC8C4FB3D
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x6AF16642
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0x8AFEFF49
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x964DD962
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0xB92D55D6
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xF8188B7D

0x8D5AA8FB
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0xA7AE5B6E
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x3389FBAD
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0x006D2003
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x9CA919E8
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xC3663CE7
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x1090DBD3
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x6C5855B1
character.
0x4773ECE9

0x8D5AA8FB
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x37B76C2F
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x397C8007
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0xC5B8837E
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0x4306BCC5
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x93C09C48
of the occasion.
0xD4D6579C

0x8D5AA8FB
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x8701B899
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x095F4E26
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x74266C50
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xE1EB6681
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0xD5630366
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x509B5D37
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0xD6703CF6
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x0FD34934
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x7EDA78C0
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xADBC385D
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0x81D6CE9C
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x291A2117
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0xD48A6783
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x6F3300C7
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x2D93BA0F
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0xE5898BE4

0x8D5AA8FB
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0xC571891D
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0xFABD5CA9
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0xA5112956
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0xDACE16D0
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x78A8837C
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x33E53B18
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x038583D5
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x1F9F4A83
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0xBF2FEEE0
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x3C11A625
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xCEB93EFF
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0xF0EF1419
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xAE889E1F
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0x81A9A731
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0xDC4E65D8
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x748B4873
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x07C36E69
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0xAFE90154
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xD9335469
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0xD38F5C39
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0xF4DBE089
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xE941A80E

0x8D5AA8FB
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x60143381

0x8D5AA8FB
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x9410D5DB
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x7C2AE129
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0xFC997407
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x9BF434F9
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x09DD6161
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x31B65561

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x4F658F79
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0xCF8CA276
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x770B821A
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x3E9AE1B5
instantly revived.
0xBF409040

0x8D5AA8FB
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x34E5DFDB
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x2C629C77
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x6B1E1F2E
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0xAFAB4AD3
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x47EEF669
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x5AAF250E
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0xABF44F7C
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x29472AF5
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0xB0403CE1
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0xDA968FD5

0x8D5AA8FB
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0xC771CFD1
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0x15015C9C
think_ again with all my might.
0xE3C3AC8A

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0xE5348B33
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x8EBD4CDF
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0xEB6932FE
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x58308F51
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x83663A35
their resource?"
0x59FC2975

0x8D5AA8FB
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x42ABA67B
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x689F851B
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x8EB726B4
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0x71C40A8A
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0xC0947221
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0xF22F1995

0x8D5AA8FB
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x73F1F57B
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xAFB6DC3C
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0xFAB790B0
_---shire Herald_."
0x3EA55B11

0x8D5AA8FB
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0xDC82B393

0x8D5AA8FB
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0x60D63E1D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0x02DB9A96
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0x2773CE7B
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0x7828D4C5
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0xCEB7AC5E
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0xD7066B83

0x8D5AA8FB
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0xA3BFB627
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0xF37FC5F0

0x8D5AA8FB
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0xCC904871
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0xF3A3D34C

0x8D5AA8FB
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x0459AC92
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x0E6AB401
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0xB81ED917
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0x85B5B726
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0x44ADC795
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0x12456DBE
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x02159DC9
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0xCAE90836
shire."
0xA63C8CDA

0x8D5AA8FB
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0xAC95C494
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x9E20F689
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x4E3E0E98
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x2B31C5B1
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0x8BEA16C4
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x8FE4C6E7
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0xDDE3F051

0x8D5AA8FB
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x2EB53DC7
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x71608D92
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0xFD85F993
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x93BCA7DC
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xF3CA0FB9
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xEF63FBBC
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x11C67548

0x8D5AA8FB
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x19E487C4
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x931619B2
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x250766D1
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0x652AA200
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0x5DC76192

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0x579C1222

0x8D5AA8FB
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0xD3489808
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x5E670508
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x4C98DFB2
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0x48F7EDA0
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0x96C302C3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0xD473E7DC

0x8D5AA8FB
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0xFCE76998
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x04CDDEB5
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xA8CC2385

0x8D5AA8FB
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x3F3313B7
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x433E4337
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x0119F967
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0xEFC12DB4
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x0C06A286
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0xADACD132
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0xA420C341
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x5E2240C9
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x574D2DA5
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x0BC43395

0x8D5AA8FB
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x0A7EB81D
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0xA9D14D11
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0xD1F4BC5D
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0xDE7EE9ED
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0xF2EDB517
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0xEC77B04E
direction:--
0xC93465AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0xC1A96DF5

0x8D5AA8FB
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x91F37678
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x03DD04E1
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x07EBABEC
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0xF665A6F9
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x1B4D8403
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x44DABBE3
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xDA1DEB01
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0x694F8CD2
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x957F5EBC
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x44B84D42
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x385CB4F9
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x94C297CE
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0xECF14A8A
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x37BD666E
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0xFDFF2596
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xF7FC4037
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xA07C76F9
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x82CA3FE9
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xF21E5FAA
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x8F1F6124

0x8D5AA8FB
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x01B885E9

0x8D5AA8FB
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0x135CB047
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x273E0F52
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0xCCC05A51
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0x2808551F
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x9332C440
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0xFD6166B0
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x76D0D1F8
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x4BFEE14E
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x4848138A
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x552DFD9B
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x0F8E9993
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x379408B6
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0x28F8B414
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x1C3FC408
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0x1B17639B
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x83C3DC08
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x800242D3
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0x7E74EE32
forthwith be furnished me.
0x320ED06E

0x8D5AA8FB
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x6E42C6C6
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x4BB26688
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x7326DEA0
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0xA00AD7DA

0x8D5AA8FB
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0xDDC93080
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x7E74DA62
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x86F1FDB1
years ago from Gateshead.
0x1D045C0D

0x8D5AA8FB
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x79380950
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0x236B5424
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x2310951F
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x715A4DB8
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0xEFCCD08F
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0xB719831C
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x43533430
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xED892EEE
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0xC5A744BE
while the change was being accomplished.
0xAA22AC79

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0xCA8C0B5B
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0xCEA884E5

0x8D5AA8FB
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0x106CE78B
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0x171829D4
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x9489F799

0x8D5AA8FB
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x0749562C
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0xCE155C0A

0x8D5AA8FB
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x97F09E38
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x8EDDE032
complexion.
0x6EB5FB7B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0xF2B3A7BD
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0xFC1F81EE

0x8D5AA8FB
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0xFC019221
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0xDA2D0EEE
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0xF1D16B1C
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x047EA2AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0xE43FEA39

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x3195F301

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x813BE0D3
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x2093C0E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x48CABD15

0x8D5AA8FB
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0x725B1E4E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x141F6DB0
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0xB41195E7
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x4408955F

0x8D5AA8FB
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0xB557E638
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0xDFF68942
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0x658B61C3
would make two of you in breadth."
0xA7E6DA3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xDBBF4EBF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x3036B25D
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0xEF3E888F
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0x503A4BA9
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0xA31FB4CE
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0xB24E5ED7
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0xA36D98E6
quarrelling--"
0x12A08430

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0xBDE1AC43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0x4D0846D2
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x23573E09
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0x252DFB0A
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0xDDB553B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"What does he look like?"
0xDB961436

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x5010476C
has such thick lips."
0x822927EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x3EF449A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x1A19DBCF
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x93821D4B
a deal of money."
0xBDF81D74

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x5B85827C

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x029E0004
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0x29622BE3
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x50DAEB34
you were quite out of my reach."
0xF9D1CDA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x00FAFE52
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xF05B0D49
shape denote admiration.
0x798A9800

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x63A108BB
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x532813A8
a child."
0xA9F968C9

0x8D5AA8FB
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0xA1845AE8
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0xE4C8B397
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0xDF02B185
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x2372F1E2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x358CB361
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0xFB2D0CA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"A little."
0xFB0D6913

0x8D5AA8FB
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0xF8249EAB
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0xD4E2266B
charmed.
0xB29DCE01

0x8D5AA8FB
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0xC9FE2355
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0xD9AAF8D2

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xAABF5721
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0x79C4AADB
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x3D97BB2D
and which she had framed and glazed.
0xDD2585E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x518D0C5C
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x1343BB5E
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x25DED61B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x7A3F2AE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0x1845286F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I can."
0x9D6BBADD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xD7D797AF
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x6D851C88
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0xDCD81DF9
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x2C586816

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never in my life."
0x21D93FDB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x3C7C7273
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x583729CA
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0xDD85E2BE
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xD2F59504
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0xA718BAB6
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0x00DBE770
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0xFCE0B28F
father's brother."
0xBB0CB4B2

0x8D5AA8FB
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x2287F3D2

0x8D5AA8FB
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x4E369AC5
tell me--"
0xE31B6309

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0xAA55CF2D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0x76A0B8B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"So he went?"
0x5CFC676A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0xEF56B30A
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x82603533
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0xFDF4AE1D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x6D5ED105
wine-merchant."
0xB4856526

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x5AA346EC
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0xEC48FEC0
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0xEC413CE5
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xC52D530C
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0xA5B55CEB
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x7F9DEC54
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x91C9B5DD

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XI
0xF29C023A

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x90346090
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x584BF10B
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x563CC8D2
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x7E5C8690
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0xFA9BE720
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x7ED6741E
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x1C938400
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0x023BD118
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xF2685FD9
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x454C1AEC
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xE46F1BD4
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x5BDC2476

0x8D5AA8FB
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xC75F9B26
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x85359D3A
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x90EAF4A3
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x628F6CBC
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x2180BE3D
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x1E3427E8
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0xE558BA10
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x1DB96F17
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0xADE95F0B
troubling my thoughts.
0x2956375A

0x8D5AA8FB
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x1901C63F
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x74375D25
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0xCE7A7C63
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x09CD3EF2
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x3AC06EDB
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x6E6F8D17
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x0F0A4153
the bell.
0x7C7F6C43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x793E5294
the waiter who answered the summons.
0xF06C69E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x4A478010
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x2C98A62D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x77EB834A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Person here waiting for you."
0x8E6E41B6

0x8D5AA8FB
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x03D4E4A6
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0xBEA1E8A0
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0xAD5EA9DC

0x8D5AA8FB
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x7DEBC900
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0xBBCCEFFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x2B25A4C0
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xBE805B1D
Thornfield.
0x4B2DFA1D

0x8D5AA8FB
"A matter of six miles."
0x50712BC0

0x8D5AA8FB
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x00E4EE98

0x8D5AA8FB
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x27DA3107

0x8D5AA8FB
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x9BF1900D
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x5AD0A1E2
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0xB7130A2E
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x16268A46
much at my ease.
0x5849EC14

0x8D5AA8FB
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0x8B903C43
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0x6A6BB5EB
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x609054DD
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x48120197
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xE664A490
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0xB7E0AE79
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0xF2B78869
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x46850743
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x6A10DA12
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x3B5F2DE0
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0xECD0EC5E
road now, I wonder?"
0xDFDB8472

0x8D5AA8FB
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0xD4382E93
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x8FF17960
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0xFCD9095E
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x79F207D0
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x640F9789
more stirring, less romantic.
0xE0C021A0

0x8D5AA8FB
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x6A4BC396
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x84121FC3
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x2FF65ABF

0x8D5AA8FB
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x634DF660

0x8D5AA8FB
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x47F57CD4
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0xD5915F1D
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x773021F3
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x8B3C25E1
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0xC65F5E8F
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x497582DE
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x50C47A2E
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x137E0C48

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0xD417C3C5
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x6E77BD09
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x0B4AC36A
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x9216AEBA
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x106368F5
itself to my view.
0x4137C946

0x8D5AA8FB
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x848BECF1
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x146264DC
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0xAF1E5E36
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x11179E7D
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x3E90281B
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0xB92E59B9
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x1ED58288
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xB764C456
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x44F0B1D4
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0xC60A73F3

0x8D5AA8FB
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xE0789A61
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0xCE23D58B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x5A1DAF50

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xC6DDE238

0x8D5AA8FB
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0x53BB4AD2
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0xF878EB95
trouble.
0x2392F2EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0xFD3BEE70
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0xFF86CE60
the keys of the storeroom."
0x23AFF907

0x8D5AA8FB
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x96A59C73
delivered them to the servant.
0xC170B863

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x2F7EBD31
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x8D00060B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, ma'am."
0x0E20D05A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0xDA803E79

0x8D5AA8FB
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0x7F7C0B18
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x2DDCAECD
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x1AFDC42B
too soon."
0x990A960B

0x8D5AA8FB
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x657F1DBE
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0xDFAC207F
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x9781DA65
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0x64B2BFAC
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x76D8091D
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x5220499A
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xC38A3B91

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x53BA8A5F
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0xEA89534B

0x8D5AA8FB
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xDD5FF7D7
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0xBDFD8F54

0x8D5AA8FB
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0xC9FB69B1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0xE0604FAA
future pupil."
0x58EE6F34

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0x2886CA50

0x8D5AA8FB
"No,--I have no family."
0x560E3AA3

0x8D5AA8FB
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x3778946A
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x49FAC0B4
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x659BE1F0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x23B49049
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0x6AF0B1E3
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0x6F51F9BD
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x81DB90A4
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0xB7DA1BB7
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0xBEA7AA86
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0xDB29B905
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0xF71119F1
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0xCF9A3B77
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x33603CBF
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x1FCB737D
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0xB998E259
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0x29B6C154
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0xEA2691E1
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0xBD9F9155
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0xEB9E1D55
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x8AAED669
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0xFAC27AAF
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xB0938EE0

0x8D5AA8FB
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x5F88A62D
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x45E2AB31
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xC35DEAF9

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0xF8E710C3
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0x4FCA19D1
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xA935037D
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0xA31E234C
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x9F3783FF
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0xADEB340A
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0x76EE3F17

0x8D5AA8FB
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0xD4F51A6B
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x01DD65D8
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0xB52DA697
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xF575A651
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x9E03BC46
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xED4A7E42
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x41786B19
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x9F576A10
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x6B56737A
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0x682A515A
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0xE55CDBB4

0x8D5AA8FB
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x8B809C6D
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0xEEB896F3
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0x8493435B
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x5DE1F8DE
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0x5F3E26C5
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xE33DD228
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x85B0F408
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0xD4534E40
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x5BA75042
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xA6735256
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0xCF7F8A4C
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x895EB03E

0x8D5AA8FB
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x3B8DBFAE
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x87CBE49E
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0xED44CBFD
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0xB8ABF8B4
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0x94572134
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0x3058AF45
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0xE07C0B84
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0x24A24EA3
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0xBA65F503
an indefinite future period.
0x86F5938A

0x8D5AA8FB
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0xF168174D
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0x5C68909D
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0xC590C6D4
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0x303D0A9A
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x50ABA70B
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x0AB56786
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0x0BCDA072
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0xD4C8D14C
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0xE2D8E78F
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0x2BCA3E7D
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x9A25253F
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0xBC428B5D
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0xF00A828E
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x2D4B798B
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xE8E0E302
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0xE19FD73B
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0x351CC4B6
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x104F23FC
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x249DD3A1

0x8D5AA8FB
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0x1FDD606B
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0xA9D0EFD8
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0xFE7BBDE3
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x813E1FAD
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0xA86C218D
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xAD46EC86
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x123A0182
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x62447BAB
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x929C1561
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x34715AFA
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x02A53032
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x4551926D
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x25A6B904
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x86774DDE
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x3E9C5509
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0xC84A922A
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0xB0E1C4B2
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x9213C718
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0x7D9935BB
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0xE427A769
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0x1C6F27A6
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0xD5FA9000
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0x5895796D
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x8AA308F1
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0x2F0A242F
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0xE4ED7C87
house and gates.
0x5FFD7CF4

0x8D5AA8FB
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0xF278496C
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x90FBDDF4
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x30F4500E
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xB8035D60
appeared at the door.
0xBBC1F768

0x8D5AA8FB
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x1FBFA80E
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0xA08FEE89

0x8D5AA8FB
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x1619EC85
much.
0x10A429D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x0AB75EF6
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xD63F4DD2
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0xAA4B5CEF
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x53CF30F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x61FCAC4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x3546CEE9
was called Rochester?"
0xAB7B9E22

0x8D5AA8FB
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0x3E6F198C
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0xD4AA1257
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x87B31F5B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x9CB24622

0x8D5AA8FB
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x90BF4FF0
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0xF3C46BBB
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x8F7743F5
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x74FE8F4C
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x2C43C8D9
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x8D50C768
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0xA8C9666B
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0x28DD9316
expect nothing more."
0xEF210131

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x602A49C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x010C32F5
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0xE6254FFB
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x53A22D61
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x33B94C75
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xE4DE7FF7
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xA472D1FD
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x15AE51DE
the better--my position was all the freer.
0xE03A3B60

0x8D5AA8FB
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x537EA716
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x6F3B53D7
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0xC5B2D3FA
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x220BBF1B
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x083726B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x00C3A653
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x8E4C6DE8
approached.
0x19F07738

0x8D5AA8FB
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0xF2C2AE3A
nurse; who answered--
0xB97D9285

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mais oui, certainement."
0xC7BE01F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xB7C03053

0x8D5AA8FB
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x74B56A8B
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xD0DF9829
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x65A6B373
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0xE2B2B93E
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0xD90F2B26

0x8D5AA8FB
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0xDE07C711
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0xC7BCCBC8
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0xCBB3F845
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x60446DA3
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x6A1D29FF
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0xF0C58E0F
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x9E5D0400
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x71BDCE83
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x9DDA0F47
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0x0E88B869
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0xA4C589BD
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x5B107DD2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x2C8789FF
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x441E91CF
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x156A236A
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x4F677585
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x4C75C3B8
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x74B70204
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0xAE859AE3
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x95B26E3D
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x23A17F6B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0xDA747003

0x8D5AA8FB
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x40B1CDBF
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x70FB237E
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xC53B0502
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0x3747D11E
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0xB10E7D4E
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xE70B7B9D
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x784F516E
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x59759855
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0xCCB24A99
fed with crumbs."
0xA59BBFEA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x2BCAAF52

0x8D5AA8FB
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0xF10DA6F9
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x303647EF

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0xAF71A1B8
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0xD0924AD6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x075652ED
clean town you spoke of?"
0x8D1CBD6A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0x2EE25F71
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0xB397DF41
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x514627F8
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xD6336B26
hear me sing now?"
0xDBD18EEB

0x8D5AA8FB
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x9C569552
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0xCAD43D3B
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0xEA81D5F7
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x431A8058
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x9DF58B9A
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0xF3F25EC5
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0xC30EC134
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0x562856EC
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x52D5BC04
affected her.
0x21703949

0x8D5AA8FB
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x760B4D50
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x906D9E4E
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0xDB6FDCAB
at least I thought so.
0x3F925324

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0xDD132919
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x4DDCFD63
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x8E06D470

0x8D5AA8FB
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0x8C400A94
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0xCE8F27A7
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x8BA56246
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x7A721082
carefully trained.
0x7442F794

0x8D5AA8FB
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x18519776

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0x87EE21EA
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0xCAA5FFB0
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xE710FA63

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x5FEC9BA1
say, with whom did you live then?"
0xD1687D51

0x8D5AA8FB
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0x5950ACC4
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x71FF039A
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x68389B8B
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x248635FC
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0xD878B701
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0x38D6335E
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x495B2534
and I never see him."
0xC876B26E

0x8D5AA8FB
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0x5815C913
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x8BC64FC4
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x6DCACF4D
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x3C553C16
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xD13E35B8
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0xB83EA81D
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x45710395
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0xB2418E27
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x1C4B3A11
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x01A66DDD
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0xFA333364
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x53F205FE

0x8D5AA8FB
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x5322E6D3
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x81416B12
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x14253BBB
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x001F31E1
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0xF422D54D
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0xEC14182F
use.
0x2EE54183

0x8D5AA8FB
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x3BD93D32
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0x74F493FE
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0xCAF1C1A8
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0xC12AFC75
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0x2FF27737
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x8D5F0262
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x2D6E9FFA
sideboard.
0xBE3CDDE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0xA5FAC378
before seen any half so imposing.
0xF0ED259E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x36845552
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0x82B885B9
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0x2A901CFE

0x8D5AA8FB
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x40079AAB
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x982921A6
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0xA69EF7AF
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x604C6EB2
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x59A8FDD9
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x0B9C952C
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0x58641B6E
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0xE22ECA48
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0xDE6100C9
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x9B8A0902
general blending of snow and fire.
0xBC7205DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0xA94B1DEB
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x2B2CB7F2
were inhabited daily."
0x425F48A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0xF59FB541
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0xB5E93F80
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0xC7F82295
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0x63171F21

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x94466A3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0x7D678F29
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x4004EFBF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x0BEEC368

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0xC5716C2A
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0xEB8B4679
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x393C9980

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0x59BD80B3
liked for himself?"
0xF8EDD856

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0xD9AC1422
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x2B3F2B53
lived much amongst them."
0xB894261E

0x8D5AA8FB
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x56273C28

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x5A2BA5A4
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x54063FBB
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x9AE60F84
conversation with him."
0xE8F19244

0x8D5AA8FB
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x114DF231

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0x6538FAE9
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0xBD967C7E
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x6040E434
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0xB2DDE8CD
he is a very good master."
0xEB8E2230

0x8D5AA8FB
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0xA1A26859
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0xE20A0709
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x817FDB14
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x75DFA186
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0xC0797849
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0xC393DAEA
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x4BE51B4A
definite notion of his identity.
0xCDCC6AB5

0x8D5AA8FB
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0x99EAEF12
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0xD07D4AD0
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0xD4D908FB
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0xEA2B58D1
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0xF3C40649
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x02932FA4
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x6CBA8358
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x5925E0FB
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x55FD2D4F
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0xFC6FA41D
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0xD8DE23F8
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0xAE3A58E6
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0xFC986FF2
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0xBDC497B7
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0x9E619F0B
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0xEB7523F9
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x77390AAC
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x44160B62
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0xE901CEA2
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x6BCDFDD1
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0x2FDCD5CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x9FE9AC5D

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x2F56D9CF
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x27C3D8A6
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x04F978E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x6DE6C33F

0x8D5AA8FB
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0xF4FEF77D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x96121D87

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0xC94967DC
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xE092A6D1
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0x8D8EB195

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x4053E7AD
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x3A3EEC05

0x8D5AA8FB
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0xBC37922C
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0xDBB98DE6
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x57AA8A65
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0xD36FC724
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0xC9F8ABF8
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0xF621DAC3
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x710577F4
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x71204966
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0xE72EB215
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x6270B9E0
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x81FF837A
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x61221CCB
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0xCCDCBD4E
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x9E5E42E4
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x9393D709
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x719A2D8F
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0x7A61653A

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0xE3FB85DA
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x00AEE5B8
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0x2B406040
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x29648256
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x979B7A95
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x35EEA1A3
Bluebeard's castle.
0x331EA901

0x8D5AA8FB
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0xDCCB6E75
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x6C6AE244
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x47FE8754
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x11FC030F
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x50853380
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x88395D25
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x3C0D39A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0xECE5B8D7
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x5EBA4657

0x8D5AA8FB
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0xB4BAA92E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xE77865AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x3BB171AA
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x9D2C1663

0x8D5AA8FB
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x844DBA63
odd murmur.
0x618925B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x8BA163DC

0x8D5AA8FB
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0xFE94F6FF
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x84DB576F
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x0D5FDA14
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0xCEF5B096
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xEFD4322C
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0xDBBD680E

0x8D5AA8FB
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0xB539418A
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x5AE76238
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0x83C06EE0
be conceived.
0x2B409579

0x8D5AA8FB
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0x95E20F2F
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xF236D46C

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0xE61CD651
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x231DE3DB
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0xF8133A47
pupil this morning?"
0xC6239FB5

0x8D5AA8FB
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0xBE145CD1
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x9989CC6C
hall, exclaiming--
0xCBD4B204

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x9B03D409

0x8D5AA8FB
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
0xAE0A3EC5

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XII
0xDACE0BC6

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0xE52C0CBB
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0xF8182A94
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0xC37EC6D6
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0xD7DBA5C0
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0x1939DAEF
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0x3A499793
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x878EDB86
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x31819111
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0xE1FD59FD
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x4CE3C4C8
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0x0FB70BD3
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x694A85ED
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x2754F740
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x347F7211
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0xBE1236E8
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x63DE56E0

0x8D5AA8FB
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x45A50840
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x4478DD14
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x5FA2D23E
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0xD1FA146F
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0x5EE6891D
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0x9DD08F9B
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x2180DCA2
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x93DF555A
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x741F3D90
of her mind and character.
0xF6C959B2

0x8D5AA8FB
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x2D2AFD01
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x6A68D516
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x0F87E1B2
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x7CF87688
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xC244C9EB
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x7BAA031D
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x322D3C02
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0xA9FEB79B
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x7872005B
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0xAA24AA7F
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x7AE0E206
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0xA314DDEB
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x8146ECE3
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0x3AC76A15

0x8D5AA8FB
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x9DAD7BCF
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x65D52C7C
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x2411847A
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x40D14005
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0xD83BB95A
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x3ED83743
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x02F0B976
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x30249FA1
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0xD2843DB9
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0xC5081611
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x8F3740CF

0x8D5AA8FB
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x2B9DE599
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x7D0CA924
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0xE0B03DE0
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0xF8AC4043
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x172D6310
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0xAA45BFCB
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x277C0893
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x0714DBB5
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xEAA01D43
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x33781FBC
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0xDB56303A
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0xFACD030C
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x4A3CAA14
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x3A520FD8

0x8D5AA8FB
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0xB39AEB9E
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0xEEE2567A
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x1CC662FD
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0xED0B622E
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0x089CF811
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x119675A0
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x3735DE74
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0xAC40AA5D
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0x05E8EE2E
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x029D8A0B
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x75965249
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0x9DDC523D
every effort of that sort.
0x146D1753

0x8D5AA8FB
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x1A1E998F
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x25B3337A
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x3279F9A3
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x2CD043E4
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0x3B45D289
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0x1EB2F59C

0x8D5AA8FB
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x141ABEFC
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0xB58F8B25
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x29887B95
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0xAE24010A
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0xBAE6F991
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0x04089C0C
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x9EC53064
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0x18148EC5
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0xCD2EE854
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x02166181
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xD2F21356
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x5CEC46EA
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0x19B59A89
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x2331258D
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0xC80B4EC8

0x8D5AA8FB
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x37C495C5
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0x38D7EAE3
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0xC3B9C60C
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x42F42B47
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x431C1DB4
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0xFC83E8D5
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0xB2E248A5
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xA72DF24F
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0x2E5656B4
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x296F1EE4
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0xC66A9F0F
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0xA956ECAE
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x1CE9F99A
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x1B0E947F
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x53B031BB

0x8D5AA8FB
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x75573776
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0x59599588
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x6155EE89
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x357A791B
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x5F8B11CF
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x458FEEC8
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0xB9AAF535
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0x71A6F4C4
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xFB054B44
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0xEC6CD709

0x8D5AA8FB
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0x1753AFEF
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x14F85CE3
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0xCFDC5B72
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x38C6B04B
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x75C72C98
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xAAD6C41D
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x01E33339
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0x29D99BFB

0x8D5AA8FB
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x19E372B8
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0xA4978D47
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x85BF65C2
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0xA81328A5
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0x1D6EC89D
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0xDAF0F18A

0x8D5AA8FB
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0xCE1FEC12
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x133129C7
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xC4510151
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x2A7F4DFE
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0x61D1B951
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x50785D8B
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xCAD1D6D0
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0xC602BEA1
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xA3AA93E6
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0x10A4DE61
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0x6CB00315
me.
0x75545466

0x8D5AA8FB
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x4B8E3929
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0xF9D21930
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x0F57FEAD
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x22A74867
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x26388B50
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x1F8F7419
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x48C7D6F7
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0x1433256B
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x49B6E8FD
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0xDF2BF2DC
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x6ADABB0B
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0xEB5F8D0D
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0xE2E63316
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xE481B263
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0xEBFF25B9
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x62D7B503
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x570BBEEA
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x473949E6
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x07E0D729
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x78EC42F0
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0xDC4D85B7
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x9051D107
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x1CE850E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x2A2BC0DC

0x8D5AA8FB
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x14DC03FD
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xACB8BE0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x56D7A3EE

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x227D95AB
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0xFE4FB5D0
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0x6DE119A8
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x19EB8940
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x0037424C
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0xD933C5FE
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x7665D6D6
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x76ED556C
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x9E17C08A

0x8D5AA8FB
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x7E874EB6
now drew near him again.
0xF923C76F

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xD15FDA0A
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xA86B0297

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0x19EAF9EF
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x2DEB052F
involuntary "Ugh!"
0x7C47B2B4

0x8D5AA8FB
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x5BB8613C
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xAE6A0F1F
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x44E012FE
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0xFFB69BC3
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x911F1860
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x4B03465B
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x79EB705E
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0xA6B3D183
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0xC57BBC32
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0xE53B164A
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x61BA3BB7
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0xDB1443C4
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0xDF7E7239
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0xB8829964
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0xC0846BDA
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0xC237BCFD

0x8D5AA8FB
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0xE67BF28C
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0x8B7DB4D4
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x5845CE26
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0x24D2A95F
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0xE510C36D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0xA2A9DFE1
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0x756DA817

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x1ABAB24D
direction before.
0xD018D244

0x8D5AA8FB
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0xACFCBF15
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x73CE9282

0x8D5AA8FB
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0xB2FA1F9C
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0xF690E3CF
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0x49C62BE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0xD6869B77
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x75F6A479
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x3A834C8B
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0xF873D560

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whose house is it?"
0x5C481B90

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x5E4D83BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0xEC66C908

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, I have never seen him."
0xDD8CF12B

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is not resident, then?"
0x3BE0247D

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x43FBBC6B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot."
0xED583675

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x841BA5FD
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0xF1774CB0
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x584F5C80
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x5D4F553E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am the governess."
0x237202A9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x159D7099
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x12B7EE4E
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x1471EB29

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0xF0256AC9
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0x17746CBB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0x21BD21D9

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0x124FEC6D
afraid?"
0xF2D7951D

0x8D5AA8FB
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0xAAD7B554
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0x08BFF6EC
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0x935F7158
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x4CA9407E
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0xEA174A25
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xCF9F38A3
he laughed.
0xA0B2A040

0x8D5AA8FB
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0x4B45A0D9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xA9374D53
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0xB2429ADF
come here."
0x4C913319

0x8D5AA8FB
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x7B48C71A
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0x159C3958
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x2C01A923
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0x5B75187C
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x78ECD39F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x0D5F7BFF
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x5A280F9C

0x8D5AA8FB
I sought it and found it.
0x17525C0D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0x1794DBBE
you can."
0x2184C4A3

0x8D5AA8FB
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0xEC6F69AE
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0x79D7129D

0x8D5AA8FB
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x5AF7062A
   The wild wind whirls away."
0x5BCF888E

0x8D5AA8FB
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x3A347963
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0xAA37BDDC
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x37470A2F
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xF30A3641
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xD7AFE90D
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0xB6F2B837
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0xF2A71888
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0xB8FE27C7
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x10E10196
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0xDC5271E7
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x18522176
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x68D94316
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x6BA176B9
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x4F01451D
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0xC3722490
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0xC02C0CFB
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x91327949
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x86DE8BE4
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xE9B27C16
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0x4E4A2C21

0x8D5AA8FB
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x4C08D41B
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xCABCC7FD
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0x466AE837
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x4566C5E9
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0xDED3460C
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x0F90C379
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xDCC88E91
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x2C4F49BF
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x35EC901E
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x49591CCA
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0xA87B025F
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x47564A3A
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x0115912D
as it would be under his.
0x71E3B39D

0x8D5AA8FB
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0x4BB3ED7F
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0xA3F988F7
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0xA24B4B75
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x34548F86
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x26E9F968
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0x577233D2
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x5A4F9C88
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xC36C07F1
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0x39284CF1
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xBD933EBA
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x5B8474C8
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0xC7CBE90B
door, and went in.
0x0B145162

0x8D5AA8FB
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x150842F1
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0xED64E950
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0xD42D1AD4
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x43032C0E
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x87C5C9B7
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x8C79DCB0
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x40E40A6F
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0xEA4E837B
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x78EDBFCA

0x8D5AA8FB
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x3D45E116
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x54CAB694
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x9E6B0BEA
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0x521774BD
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0xC7E1D9B9
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0xDBF5D545
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0xCB4BB9B8
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x172A6BF5
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0xDFE16997

0x8D5AA8FB
"What dog is this?"
0xFB9AC343

0x8D5AA8FB
"He came with master."
0xA2F598B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"With whom?"
0xE98DDB3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x8EA05581

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xF6EF6F99

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x2C0594A5
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x8181D2CB
sprained."
0x9CC52C21

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x4C211F59

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0xDEE954AA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0x6BF6BF26

0x8D5AA8FB
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0x6ECC40CD
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0xC95B893F
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0xB3EB7CA4
upstairs to take off my things.
0x77DE3D09

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XIII
0xB6C2EDC5

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x66CAC13A
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0xC768D577
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0x81C09781
and waiting to speak with him.
0x1581CBD9

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0xCA7DF51A
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0xF14F9A71
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xC91D97A1
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x7B327B96
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0xEBC8F054
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x4021861D
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0xFFCAA79E
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0xD7214CFD
master: for my part, I liked it better.

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x81F6F9CE
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x6565542C
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0xD8F32EE4
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0xB142CF33
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0x32492B87
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x0F7BD63F
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x994C3AA1
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x46927B41
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x7045A126
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0xEB90DFEE
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x13B2E0CF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x26FE612A
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x724DFC3D
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x334137BE
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0xA7D5CEDA
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0xD9744F26

0x8D5AA8FB
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xFFF0F02D
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x50B15FBF
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x53A62603
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x288C7773
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x8E49DDE7
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x70ABA9D9
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0x9367116C
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xCC0169AF
fireside.
0x6DB72F60

0x8D5AA8FB
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x7F971B32
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x55C2CD39
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x55D3319B
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0x865E2504
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x8B420E21

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0x3972F7F5
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0xDB8D1AB7
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x7CE80493

0x8D5AA8FB
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xFCFFF531

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x0B14D5BC
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x023D7A50
candle."
0xE66618C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x330CEB97

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x3B203118
is here."
0x5275AFB4

0x8D5AA8FB
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0x8A57DF6B
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0xF9660B77
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x74725611
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0x8FD2CC9B
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0x05A5B41E

0x8D5AA8FB
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x4E19370B
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0x524E42C6
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0xA8BAF7AB
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xF6471F4E
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0xFA117336
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0xBEFF805C
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x46F2C753

0x8D5AA8FB
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x374AF8F4
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x0EE51C76
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x248CB864
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x9FFA58D8
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0xD30DFBEE
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0xA209C1C6
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0xF7A70B5E
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x8A235775
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x2A63DA4E
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0x937B6CD2
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x7986ABBB
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x7629CD43
neither tall nor graceful.
0x5FAA1B75

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0xA8F8BA98
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0xC84FEB20
lifted his head as we approached.
0xF0404BB6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0x57FF5830
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0x3674260A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x52460A38
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x9221ABD1
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0xC43D21DB
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0xA0B72358

0x8D5AA8FB
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x3FAE20E1
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0xB2F521A9
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x3C01750A
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x44093A74
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0xF056D912
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x832C71C0

0x8D5AA8FB
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0x680AAC70
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x42DBBFC1
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0xB39323A6
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0xAFDC5C16
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x55BFAB38
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x2C877410

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x87148DA5
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0xA1C2EE21
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x25DFCCE7
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xE04AF2ED

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x13D6FEC7
might perhaps spill it."
0x51E39C5A

0x8D5AA8FB
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0xB060C850
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0xC950C3F6

0x8D5AA8FB
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x8F4D3E2B
votre petit coffre?"
0x40275743

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x3B563630
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x21BFCFAD
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x8E5A6ED8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x44E0D1E4
thought pleasant things."
0xE7DB2B4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x5C86210D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x4C89C9AD
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0xC1D0915D
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xE1C74E8C
nature."
0x6E3B1BA5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0x57C38CC1
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0xA9D22842

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x6AA0EE6A
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x802CBC95
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x06AA22DE
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x9B5FE7A7
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x5C7535B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x9451E293
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xB86298FB
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0x16ED2D8F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x6130A3E5
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x72FB698C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x438F422B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x96D97A37
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x0A4D5553
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0xC5253093
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xAFBFDF63
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x6CFF668C
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x28DF3FB8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0x88E7F94E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you came from--?"
0x670B6A7C

0x8D5AA8FB
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xC8431B9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x04FB98BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Eight years."
0xEAB751A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x2128C566
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x9AD517AC
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0x333565D3
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x6C4E029A
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x4839C73E
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xFC09D049

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have none."
0x8E29F4D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x247BFB4B

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0xEC10F427
that stile?"
0x91553E8C

0x8D5AA8FB
"For whom, sir?"
0x2A870764

0x8D5AA8FB
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x40BD2260
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0x50B4A36F
causeway?"
0xEF20D49F

0x8D5AA8FB
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xDF29FD02
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0x9D8E8A06
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x4DF41D59
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0xC0570575
revels more."
0x84322C5A

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xCF5B8DA3
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0xF84B0237

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x5538EE8F
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x6F26562A

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; none that I ever saw."
0x0AD27AFF

0x8D5AA8FB
"And your home?"
0x90DE3ACE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have none."
0x8E29F4D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x673F00FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0xCD0F6AEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0x12F76CF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xEBE6537D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x9C155D0C
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0xC4C804FC
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x7F9AE523
Adele."
0x3A2EFD67

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0xCF330F43
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0xC539C00A
felling my horse."
0xF7D01D05

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x862DFC46

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0x7566D4E0

0x8D5AA8FB
The widow looked bewildered.
0x5646FA70

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x1700FB7E

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir."
0x61955C12

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you seen much society?"
0x90BA7AD9

0x8D5AA8FB
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0xD2EB8291
Thornfield."
0xD3B263B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you read much?"
0x4AD22736

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0x8B8F25E1
very learned."
0x170E2E51

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x06008BE2
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0xA3C2146F
parson, is he not?"
0xE42A05B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0x76AF0E8B
would worship their director."
0x8D85725E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, no."
0x1DD1BB37

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x175E114D
sounds blasphemous."
0x689C637B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0xA6AF1509
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x4B00AD80
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0xE1C549CD
hardly sew."
0x6E6C7599

0x8D5AA8FB
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x1502D2F1
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0xF1277D2E

0x8D5AA8FB
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0x68BE9124
Rochester.
0xA0BC7B74

0x8D5AA8FB
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0x890C8D60
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x6254BBEE
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0xD6648FF4
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0xD7621A84
to bed."
0x1AB2F35B

0x8D5AA8FB
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0xFFDD1F66

0x8D5AA8FB
"About ten."
0xB09F4282

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0x630114A2

0x8D5AA8FB
I assented.
0xB98AA100

0x8D5AA8FB
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x85CEE90C
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x693B33D8
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xC168F858
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0x22D05793

0x8D5AA8FB
"A little."
0xFB0D6913

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0x72B49C50
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x7ED63464
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xEA4040F3
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x807097DA
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xB0F7CE3E

0x8D5AA8FB
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x78F03A5F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x9885D968
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xFA4410D0
not well."
0xA5641ABB

0x8D5AA8FB
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x483AA3BC
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x1A550694
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0x54421E0A

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x7C4E0FCB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x0CF69756
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x3D06F7C6
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x875B36A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0x2AEAF92E

0x8D5AA8FB
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0xFBBCC7AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x7D5242F0
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x73370FC5

0x8D5AA8FB
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0x7A952D67
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0xAFF20F01

0x8D5AA8FB
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0xC602E990
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x40A47049

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xD727346E
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x8A7A1FAF
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x91829751
hand yours?"
0xCB791780

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x79652A8D
some thought."
0x8BEB7755

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0xE5EFBCAB
other occupation."
0xE903D361

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where did you get your copies?"
0x58B8AC6C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Out of my head."
0x4AC4230E

0x8D5AA8FB
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x31461469

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0xE1A7B547

0x8D5AA8FB
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0x4003A881

0x8D5AA8FB
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0xABE2AEE5

0x8D5AA8FB
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0xBA288793
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0x770E9DCA
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xE8B70F6F
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0xBE6327D3
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x7087D5BD
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0xC624BA3F

0x8D5AA8FB
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x8FF571B8
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x3EEB5668
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xD73CD267
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x6C9E1D76
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0xF28F344A
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xAB6969C1
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x81A6F66B
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0x6041911E
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0xCE13A8C0
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x73428289

0x8D5AA8FB
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x24D766CC
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x945961C1
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0xAAC3F346
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x10068FC0
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x0A976D7E
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x6B84BF5F
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0x07DF558D
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x24248E8D
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x0F26EE5E
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0x161F264A

0x8D5AA8FB
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0xA0107277
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x9CCC37C2
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x2D110C30
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xC6C6E25E
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xA0F2E58D
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x9B78D291
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x1E8C2B57
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x8789D8B0
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0xC9545B2F
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0xE84B65CA
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0xAE070B26
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0x6A2CD509

0x8D5AA8FB
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x91A10361
presently.
0x7CEAA0E2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x75D4345F
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0xB693D309

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x2FD8BD25
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x9981BF46
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x528D49E7
each day?"
0x076AE753

0x8D5AA8FB
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0xF0F224DC
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x5B8E7FB9
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0xFF003F8D

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0xC64FCA2A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x90B3FC16
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x16CAEE32
powerless to realise."
0xFFF82A46

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x1C09832E
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0x2657B3F2
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x93E31EAE
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x03FC65BE
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x69A88DD5
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x92767D1D
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0x96F8181A
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0xC2444934
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x9CD15D8A

0x8D5AA8FB
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x361276EF
watch, he said abruptly--
0x92BD240C

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x2D5B0A8E
so long?  Take her to bed."
0xBBA18A8A

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x61606618
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0xCEA9094F
much.
0x10A429D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x8FCB7D79
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0xB49B2C54
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x44658816
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0xDB2028CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0xCD680C0E
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x0BC0FE67

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, is he?"
0xA647E087

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0xFD564D41

0x8D5AA8FB
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xC6C38135
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0x895485B9
temper, allowance should be made."
0x1017E3E8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?"
0x9052B961

0x8D5AA8FB
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x33B52F77
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0x36D2D941
make his spirits unequal."
0x7F8D2B6D

0x8D5AA8FB
"What about?"
0x748922FF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0x9C6715A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"But he has no family."
0x2B14DD30

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x3D2796E7
brother a few years since."
0x701860F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x4BE51E6F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x979C129E
the property; only about nine years."
0x630E36F3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xAE62EBEA
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x9CE5AC6F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x4EC3C134
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x84418205
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x63E08457
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x9BDA7C5C
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x20F8BA51
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x31183153
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0xBBF28181
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0xBEDACFAC
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0x6B071639
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0xF2A0B9C8
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0xD4E4CCA1
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0xFECFD936
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x396CCD9C
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0x8F180DF4
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x569392A8
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0xFF91E928

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why should he shun it?"
0xA7F9EF59

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x0604DA19

0x8D5AA8FB
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0x59580F9B
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xA9D54C7E
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x263645C3
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0xFBE4A080
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x76198E79
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x73873F9E

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XIV
0x11AC8DC8

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xC09C0626
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0x00818B6F
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0x2605D724
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x8A846062
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0xB28B9D51
generally did not come back till late at night.
0xD5F2F5C4

0x8D5AA8FB
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x20A712FC
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x5DE65827
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x1D7E24BA
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x08083980
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x7C16279B
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xBAABC319
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x3C3BA918
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x51C7F5E7

0x8D5AA8FB
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x56BA52BD
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x3C2E54B5
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0x1D93815E
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x98032C39
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0x37580A4D
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xC99DA0A3
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x88C1D802
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0x32471AE0
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x5D7FAE96
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0xDF6DBB89
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x69CCB13A
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x5BA31DA4
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x89FB5D71

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x1304CE65

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x96643B50
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0xF9A6511F
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x7099600F
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x09C3E132
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x50CA7A65
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x91C0C666
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x44D7C73B

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x4E0AA28E
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x55466380
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0x589C0C5E
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x4996BF43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xCAD2A44B
contemplation.
0xD4837871

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0xC33A0573
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x4E8D747C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x040DAC05
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0xFD0AD522
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0x5D6E0528
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0xFBAE0449
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x979E22CB
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x8954E3C0
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0xF641A6EB
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x947A136F
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x1F84FD00
said to be thicker than water."
0xC92066F9

0x8D5AA8FB
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x7E4DC93D
knitting-basket in hand.
0x40DC0911

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x569E0536
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0xF9B918EE
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0x807091E1
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xF0794C49
performed."
0x34A07449

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0xCC6665AD
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x62F9437C
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x405B449E
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x352B1652

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x4590F4AD
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x79AB6778
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x0C309F4D
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x23AA08D6
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xE7DF740A
mind to do."
0xB2A05BB2

0x8D5AA8FB
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x2E55F139
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0x6769D68D
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x80811078

0x8D5AA8FB
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xC77EC05A
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0x7FF46C64
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x01FF3322
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x38F365BB
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x16235EB8
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xE6A5E6E4

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x6563B31B
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0xF7B6EE87
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0xB7C78472
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x49056477
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x74EAE693
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0xAEB11F68
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xC9E343A7
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0x3DB51CED
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x98E78E51
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0xB7E2F6D9
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x2B058F16
feeling.
0xB48E4AAD

0x8D5AA8FB
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0xAFC95500
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x9B3972F5
fastened on his physiognomy.
0xF81AD474

0x8D5AA8FB
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x9FD44355

0x8D5AA8FB
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x7C4BDD3B
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x824CD021
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x7A868F2A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x145A4798
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x4C9D7525
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x7041DE00
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x1E5B3D27
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x997F10A9
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0xE93BDE4A
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xBA2FDEFD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x9533D5E5
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x8875C057
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0x2D400BB6
consequence, or something of that sort."
0x72BE9C57

0x8D5AA8FB
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x3B8DCFCB
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0xB55B785C
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0xDCCDD205
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x02DA2A3C
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xF60552B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xA503B64D
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x89166D68

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x1D259B56
does my forehead not please you?"
0xFD9ADC48

0x8D5AA8FB
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0xD009BE76
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x5B081EA5
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x4C94CABF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x56041D06

0x8D5AA8FB
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x59879A04
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0xDE3E09E0

0x8D5AA8FB
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x535B9A79
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0xB1A4EF37
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x5B8952CE
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x840EB634
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0x4ACA4EC1
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x2CB75D18
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xD7DD7557
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x698F0B25
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0xCCF04FB5
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x170416D2
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x46FA6491
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x45CAA2F8
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x44044D40
me?"
0x601CE7DC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hope of what, sir?"
0xDAADAABD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0x9E6AB918

0x8D5AA8FB
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x7E053F5B
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0xB5860605
capable of being re-transformed?
0x8A4C1F5D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x76D021F1
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0xA3622A96
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xEB2A2C83
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0x0139FCE9
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x4CFB18EB
to-night."
0x8B985E75

0x8D5AA8FB
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x0E56AA96
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0xA45DA75A
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x2A154587
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x6CA0B001
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x711ED579
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x4F7278C7
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x4D781B15
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0xEED09A86
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0xE18C6A14
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x831319D2
confidence.
0x028988D6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x424C3523
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x00194D13
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0x161226C2
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x5080AACD
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0xBBA0F9E4
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0xC38B0968
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0xD02F71FE
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x3AB365F0
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xCA60FEFA
you--therefore speak."
0x405B5B5E

0x8D5AA8FB
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x5C1B2DA6
smile either.
0x411D1A3D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Speak," he urged.
0x9BB60D29

0x8D5AA8FB
"What about, sir?"
0x97855E51

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0x28F8070E
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x2D32B0F6

0x8D5AA8FB
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x1D756DF8
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xC8927735
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0x4D068A5F

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xA31847B0

0x8D5AA8FB
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xEFEDAE94
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x9E6542D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xA327DB84
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x598ADE64
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x2C0052FD
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xC88F337B
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x64CF8392
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xF65B171D
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x44BFD197
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0xE79A31C7
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x6B7962B4
rusty nail."
0x30C65BB1

0x8D5AA8FB
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0xC5A98BA4
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0xC3682B81

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x740DC69C
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0xB9742A62
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x1AA1FD62

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0xA5F32532
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x651E8B10
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x6299D10A
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0xE9F3326C
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x4F5820BB
people in one house?"
0x93B8A754

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do as you please, sir."
0xF818BDE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x6F0622CE
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0xFD6809DD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0xDBA93C0E
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x787040B0
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0xBABFF9B3
and experience."
0x1AD8C56B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x77A6EDD5
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x3D8FB572
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x26245B1D
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x06B719CC
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xFA926E24

0x8D5AA8FB
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xA69FA206
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0xCBF32040

0x8D5AA8FB
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0x5553C6AE
expression; "but speak too."
0x1BADF559

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x5D8859F6
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xE7C48045
their orders."
0xA7958BA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xCFC655A9
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x8FC61328
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x8ED196C2

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0xBCEC7643
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xDAC48709
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x7BAE8D42

0x8D5AA8FB
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0x15BE4ECA
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0x76A82499

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xA24AC9CB
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0xF369F824
salary."
0xC2A43929

0x8D5AA8FB
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x6A928581
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x5067872A
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0xFE674C92
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x4ABC9FB2
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0xE53EDFB0
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x378101EA
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x01850FAB
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xE70091C0
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x4B273328
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x1B9230DF
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0xECDC4B8E
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0xA1209901
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x80A68138
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0xD3BBD2FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x19AD60DB
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x09A66DD5
as well as imagined--
0x225F108F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x9B9B21A0
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x7B9A5B01
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0x64738223
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x1B8DCD41
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xF177EADB
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x7DE774B2
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0xA1D98972
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x5D41F1A3
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x99BD13BA
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x8D9B0BF5
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0xC2645E8D
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x16B25883
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x10BDCB3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0xECD53E4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x715AE327
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x2CA0C892
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x3B2461BA
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x50D01AE7
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0x474EC99C
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0xE9546027
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x61DBAEA3
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0xED415CAE
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0xA39A1F94
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xB0A84BAF
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x8C023C14
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xD116A285
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x3464E577
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0x215BEED7
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x5584FD47
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x8F3AFF37
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0x2C2C1AC2
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0x756D147E

0x8D5AA8FB
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0x230C43F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0xCF3A9172
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0xCB8F5C76
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x61008C4D
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0xEB0A29BB
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0x203ABC69
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x59ABA305
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0x079A7DD8
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0xFCBE4711
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x90E57FB3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x42A908D5

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0x429A9EC3
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0x235148FE
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0xE3E07A84
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0x2D6A21BD
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0xB36A1618

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0x650749A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0xD57470CD
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0x3364F654
moor."
0xBA376777

0x8D5AA8FB
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0x68FDA77C

0x8D5AA8FB
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0x02C87B13
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0x9C0B1237
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x025C6D5A
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0x46E02768
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0xD25B9D3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x92DD58D7
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0xE8B18BFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0xAC77334A
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0xED650765
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x071E7E2A
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0x98380A89
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0x2D2FD6FA
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0x12CD0B9F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0xCE5247D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0xC3620982
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0xEF4231C1
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0xA178D305

0x8D5AA8FB
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0xAD5114C7
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0x82FBCC04
misery if you listen to it."
0x44264D96

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0x2FC406BA
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0x2CCB24C4
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0xA8252D43

0x8D5AA8FB
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x3F73396B
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0xD9EE88CB
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0x6392808A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0x497872D7
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0x81429C02
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x227F2296

0x8D5AA8FB
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0x86A8CA39
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x2371A779
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0xEAA67F57
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0xF069DA5C
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0xF36D6E64
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0x7690FE17
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0xC1651AC5
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0x8A2EA993
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0xCDF3EB0D
which you might revert with pleasure."
0x7595149F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0xF07E77E9
paving hell with energy."
0xDF6391B1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir?"
0xAF80061B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0xA04CA2E7
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0xAB9F6270
been."
0xB049D5DF

0x8D5AA8FB
"And better?"
0x96C4B916

0x8D5AA8FB
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0x0FD63A1A
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0x760AE074
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0x1F87BBD4
and Persians, that both are right."
0x9A72A835

0x8D5AA8FB
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0xB8E3D036

0x8D5AA8FB
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0xD22F0A7D
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0x7AE92865

0x8D5AA8FB
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0xD49D6DF1
is liable to abuse."
0xDABA1DA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0xE4A670E4
abuse it."
0xCA4F9E5A

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are human and fallible."
0xD8C483B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0xC07C1CF5

0x8D5AA8FB
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0xB597C727
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xBEDF6085

0x8D5AA8FB
"What power?"
0x8CFF05DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x3DF966E2
right.'"
0x0AEB91FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0x02E1EA2B

0x8D5AA8FB
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0x71F85A14
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0x7100F9EA
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0x7E3DE6B6
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0xF1476E6B
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0xDA15D1E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where are you going?"
0x8FC219E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xDF0F8F97

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0xEF79048A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0x0A73F5BE
certainly not afraid."
0xA62295A3

0x8D5AA8FB
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0x794609CB

0x8D5AA8FB
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0x86B2BB8E

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0xC04D2B91
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0x5F16AD54
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x628C683F
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0x6F14E39A
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0xBFF94924
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0xA5D47BAE
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0x50356456
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0xB2EF85A7
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0xBDFEE3D2
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0x1C8A9E14
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0x65D06A60
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x346B9B13
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0x54AAEEEB
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0x8E465F2C

0x8D5AA8FB
"It has struck nine, sir."
0xD86EE159

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0x4CED1B7F
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0x8346F088
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0x70ADF576
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0x22A85CEC
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0xC6B13AE1
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0x60B0D78D
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0xC4426136
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0x3686E8D5
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x71CB4661
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x963DC710
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0xF4411015
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0x036F5C7D
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0x21C46DF3
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x94554A77
will be realised."
0xFACCF850

0x8D5AA8FB
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0xA0F7F054
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x423B1167
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0x22D76E56
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0xAF1E4BB2
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0xB1E446A1
and small white satin sandals.
0x447408C3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0xC390AD2C
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0x2704C743

0x8D5AA8FB
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0xA8E77DF8
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0xFFED203A
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0xEC3CE91A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x6D84EA47
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0xCCB3D792

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x8017762B
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0x5735E54A
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x971E9CDB
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0xFA6F6C4F
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0xDAAF981F
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0xAB8F3104
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x4E533DF9
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xD1BFFC6D
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0xEB69F45F
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x8B133429
Good-night."

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XV
0xEA361916

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x6470B91E
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0x2527B26E
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0x854C0271
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0x9F931AF7

0x8D5AA8FB
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0x0979C532
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x78ACC358
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0xB4CE0045
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x09C47AD7
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x0CE1312D
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x71C129B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0xC10E592E
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x66C7C407
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0x2DB628A0
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x1C785A45
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0xB50D077E
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x782FFE52
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0xA51BEEE1
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xDE2DDFE1
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0x95C28D8A
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0x7064378F
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0xA16ECA06
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x4D917D81
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x42F2CD74
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0xCD8BF478
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x8D3F4512
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0xDF3E4C21
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0xFEB61C24
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xB864702A
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x4466BE83
now, if you will excuse me."
0x574222CF

0x8D5AA8FB
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x23CEB041
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0xDFE532DD
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0xAED305A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0xE498C35E
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0xDEC94851
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0x940BFE47
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0xB8C9BD1A
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xE02C8A05
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0x628A34E6
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0xC0D66B6A
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xB38CA832
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0x7FCC12F0
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0x01F5850F
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x28DC46E9
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0xBCEF1171
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x9B22A1EE
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0xAF1549F1
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0xEB4A71E2
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0x2DF6D303
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0xF8DF2E60
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x9932CD07

0x8D5AA8FB
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0xAEC28FDE
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x5533A0B0
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0x7F5B5477
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x0828C279
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0x8AF6C0FD
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0xFD3E31F8
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x82A77E08
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0xCB158C63
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x19556B96
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0xBD94F3C2
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0xF3441DD7
current--as I am now.
0xB71E0115

0x8D5AA8FB
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0xC4631E78
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0x05694ED6
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0xCFC48B18
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x603D907B
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x441B3D49
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xC39A1670

0x8D5AA8FB
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x59A4BD73
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x8BC9996A
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0x9EF43A13

0x8D5AA8FB
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x80035151
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x14564193
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x157FED8C
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x9C376721
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x74819188
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0xA443216E
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xF7DD92C0
his countenance: he went on--
0xF255E3DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0xB5745BAB
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x3B22EB3C
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x881B268A
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0xE4AA0F48
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x2C3D9F79
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x5B73D6BD
if you dare!'
0x6C3D50A9

0x8D5AA8FB
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x4E5BE423
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x94EAD80A
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x13E84C57
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0xAEBAA542
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0x1D65B883
but straw and rotten wood."
0x20C37719

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x05F665B3
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0xBDCD4584
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x8C053F08
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0x3F009C32

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x09B034C9

0x8D5AA8FB
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0xD146861B
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x0D3E544A
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xEDC58CDD
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xC508761F
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0xF3215C6D
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x4534C493
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x296CDA92
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x5263D1C6
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0xF02F46BF
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xBE8F4975
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0xAF1F8314
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x653D50F2
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x2EA2A85F
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0x39890121
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0xC1D4B144
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x1922D42C
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0xCA4C6FFF
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x21B6C998
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x3D2B7BE3
After this digression he proceeded--
0x8A659374

0x8D5AA8FB
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x603C946B
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x28C80C92
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0xADE800CC
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0xE59AF86F
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0x8971FB50
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x4CC79C89
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0xC4675249
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0x88CA20FA
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0xBDB6C84C
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x8D25E3BC
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x574E5ACB
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xFD99AE17
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0xB1AAF9A3
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xD8A633CB
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x14291E14
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0xD90C1459
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0x25A55FC0
who had been her dupe.
0xE1A7240B

0x8D5AA8FB
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xC9F4C97F
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0xFAA8322C
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0xD43D4A71
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0xB605F7A4
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0x668837F8
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0x8E8512B8
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x5B7D5F95
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0xB7207375
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0xD4C7E8EA
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0xD578127D
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0x4F6B819F

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele here came running up again.
0x531C4ED8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0x8A8AB01F
wishes to see you."
0xC4DA23C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x718733E4
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x9D7A3DED
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x1B8FF7BC
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xFD5003AA
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0xE44D986C
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x3E60C62D
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x77994B81
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0x768D090A
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0xAF829D6A
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0x7C219521
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0x7415CA73
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x2DE14D0D
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0x61967AE2
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0xD78054CA
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x8DBA685F
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x71C132D9
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x3E5B0769
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0xFBE66648
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xF807C578
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0xE0067A55
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0xDB3DBD71
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x2BC1DA1F

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0xAC0CAFEE
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xD07196B6
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0xA832CABB
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0x05031DDA
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x21D8E0E5
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0xBBF3EC4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x60A05CDD
you too: it darkens."
0xD9C9A871

0x8D5AA8FB
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0x9C66FC1A
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x78AC5B47
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x591EB0CC
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x25E4AA9A
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0x0F3CC72C
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x84F82633
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x862FC4A2
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x0920C053
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0x514A3310
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0xFFBFB2A7
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x9C89B3DF
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0xCAFC860E

0x8D5AA8FB
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x1B418017
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x77D4CBC4
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0xC77B7A56
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0xCEDD7DDB
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x66FDB1AF
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0xF1A191D2
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x2F1D96AE
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0xD8F9A428
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0xF2CF3ACF
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x44018704
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0xB5D278F7
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x95E944C9
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0x8327FA15
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0xC7BD1ACA
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0xFCEA7A00
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0xC0FB63B6
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0xCEC22E19
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0xB93AAEA6
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x4E927477
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0x9E888013
benefit.
0x2C71DB77

0x8D5AA8FB
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0xDB55AD23
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0x322678D3
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x1D850E14
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0x3CD5323F
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x8440FF4A
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xF5C03B66
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x6672C786
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0xD1570BEE
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0x368BBB9F

0x8D5AA8FB
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x858459FC
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0xA0C46EB7
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0xC9A24184
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xC94C84A8
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0xBFE9F92E
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x937D7C61
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xE40859C3
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x193ABE65

0x8D5AA8FB
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x93E34E5F
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0xA0DAD622
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0xE78EB051
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0xB894D203
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xE868FA48
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0xD8B61458
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xE3912878
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0xE90C9CCD
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0x3F2B8C11
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x6FE2D8CD
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x0979FE08
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x21A5A5AD
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0xA72BDEA6
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0xC4A7A381
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x9A293D3E
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xAADCF481
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x9B6B0C0E
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x786C6DC9
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0xF9824D0F

0x8D5AA8FB
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0xC192D21E
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0xA28DBF36
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0x34EB9306
Thornfield.
0x4B2DFA1D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0xFB9BF7A2
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0xA04D3469
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0xBD9C6A0D
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x47228414
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0x4AC773CA

0x8D5AA8FB
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0xE530C076
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x75AA9981
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0x2FE7F467
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x5B492800
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x67007708

0x8D5AA8FB
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x0552CA35
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0xD0194B51
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0xF1D9AB45
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x43BF25C9
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x75ECB767

0x8D5AA8FB
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xFB1D236C
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x718F4B33
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x5D5A9986
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x68C1D773
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xE29A8898
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x59D29467
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0x345258F4
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x46A75662
enough.
0x9E1B2D77

0x8D5AA8FB
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x2219F3DD
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0xA20F6587
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x51640848
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x9D0F3677
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x269F1B8A
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xF4037CD4
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0x830BCC83
there?"
0x96C1A014

0x8D5AA8FB
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x146A68CF
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0xE3B0D195
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x364E4855

0x8D5AA8FB
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0x3493F8C7
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0xDE5A3A61
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0xCE71CF21
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x0EB567C5
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x910134B6
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0xBE46DDF5
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0x28A390F9
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0x52DED86A
burning.
0x3C5E944E

0x8D5AA8FB
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0xBB402B54
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x34C4B5F1
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x0F6B9EEE
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x38A8A570
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x6C301E1B
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0xD9CFC8B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x5A797CFF
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x92D05793
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0x2218E34A
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0xFCDC75A3
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x098F5BA3
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x93C50EDE
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0xD35ECAF0

0x8D5AA8FB
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x05E4D49D
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0x526627C4
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0x323F27CC
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0x53AFE847
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xA89DCB7E
water.
0x32B68B94

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x00122E95

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x1E182274
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x006CB386

0x8D5AA8FB
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x30406F97
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x204A3DE7
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x31976610

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x60DE0D8E
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0xEEB8F246

0x8D5AA8FB
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x7FE2340E
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x50829CD2
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x97EA5D1D

0x8D5AA8FB
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0xDD966756
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x39FCCE0B
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xBB66B7FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0xAF857FCC
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0x3EEBEAD2
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x3D44CB90
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x0C69B134
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0x7DC56E0E

0x8D5AA8FB
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0x94A96FFB

0x8D5AA8FB
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x45B3FAA5
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0x65D8F22D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x20A4145C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0xB8F331A7
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x58AD486F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0x83D2C4A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xB6BD57AD
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0xC979D9C1
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x7200E2E0
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0x4A47EAB7
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x55806389
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0xFB62F88A
move, remember, or call any one."
0x251114E0

0x8D5AA8FB
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xD90CBDE5
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x4CE0841B
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xC03F1582
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0xF277151D
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0xB69A8E73
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0xC381AE42
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0x13024E71
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0xD110C3A2
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0xD001ACCB
"and not something worse."
0xF0088A14

0x8D5AA8FB
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0xD2B5F669
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x4A07BE90

0x8D5AA8FB
"How, sir?"
0x7D176CC4

0x8D5AA8FB
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x532FE298
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0x261C8D31

0x8D5AA8FB
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0x126E2540
door."
0x1196B745

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0x475466A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xFAA0CF41
think, or something like it?"
0x334A32D5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x8AAEB672
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x49DCCBFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0xB124F578
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0x2769DCBD
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x7F222C20
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x5682D620
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x239E999D
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x7DBFE2A0
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x2F3932C2
hours the servants will be up."
0x3AC28774

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x5D18CD40

0x8D5AA8FB
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0x3D4D6EDA
go.
0xEF751A70

0x8D5AA8FB
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xA896078E

0x8D5AA8FB
"You said I might go, sir."
0xD4A49EB6

0x8D5AA8FB
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0xF4EB2B74
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x862D1F96
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xD8225ACD
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0x30E042D2
At least shake hands."
0x7504E8F9

0x8D5AA8FB
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0x85803385
both his own.
0xBCD69E73

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x88609EB2
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x73DBC08D
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0xECE7F666
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0xA918689E

0x8D5AA8FB
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x90BA616A
his voice was checked.
0x8461BB0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0x44A46F65
in the case."
0x68943D93

0x8D5AA8FB
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0x1262C83E
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0x7ED4ED69
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0x634CBA8F
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xC45F7728
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x97351445
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x37602F3A

0x8D5AA8FB
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x6577BBB4

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0xB6A927B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x263D5A11

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am cold, sir."
0xDEEC1708

0x8D5AA8FB
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x9FDDEFDB
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0x8F64DA22
expedient.
0x8326D88E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x18EDA431

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x11B04754

0x8D5AA8FB
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x1D3AFC6D
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x55FD2967
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xF325D6CF
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x165CE187
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0x8CC40310
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x100C2FC2
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0xDBD5F0D0
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x721561E8

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XVI
0x4B161E5C

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x0838EB03
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0x994D0F43
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x1A0B0FB5
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0xED2905F9
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xDE763391
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x24DFE295

0x8D5AA8FB
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x6AE610A3
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xFD7DB8E5
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x21CB9FCE
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x2BD2C520
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xD644DD53
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0xDCE7637B
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0x8C77F654
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0x0DDA21D4
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0xA9FB390A

0x8D5AA8FB
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0xDBE96685
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0xF82543D5
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0x1893E8AD
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x2C691B96
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0xA96288BF
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0x43D54DDF
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0xE20B1FDA
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0xB5E70A3C
no other than Grace Poole.
0xEA2BBC1C

0x8D5AA8FB
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x1171F7EA
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0xABA03771
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0x70BAD0E7
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0x47444FBE
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x76B65F52
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x84D15DA2
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0xDE72EAFC
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x9FA527F7
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x0A3F990B
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0xCFB5539E
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x1CF9C9FF
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0x1EDF6FA7
went on with her sewing.
0x97A34295

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0x49A69C7C
is past comprehension."
0xB7F6AEFD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x569EE1ED
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x4837F9DC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0xC7645C0E
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xC44FDCCB
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xF93E9A3C
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x029D8F09

0x8D5AA8FB
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x6464BFE1
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0xBAF89639

0x8D5AA8FB
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0xA5C48204
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x4B88B860
she answered--
0x75A14C36

0x8D5AA8FB
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x543316A9
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0x7202594D
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0xBFCEB27D
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0xCD5F907E
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x918BD6B9
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x1D5FC2A5
a noise?"
0x00D78613

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0xC948F36E
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0xC0D28753
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0xA26DDC49

0x8D5AA8FB
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x4A24C92B
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x66139FF2

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x8ABA5F5C
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x5DE60361

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x4094C00E
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x74CAA57E
conscious eye.
0xE1E2BA8B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xCB4035FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xE3C3BF16

0x8D5AA8FB
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x0D39298A
gallery?" she further asked.
0xEAA18FE6

0x8D5AA8FB
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0xDE3A7B85
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x83954D28
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x1CE9510A
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0xC9EDF6E5

0x8D5AA8FB
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x4FE3CB1B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0xD1A61DCE
you get into bed?"
0x8036955D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x3941C1C9
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0xD8B0819D
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0x5D384736
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x80D37F1B
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x86954A91
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x57FB8395
lie down."
0x7E394CBC

0x8D5AA8FB
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x4C2230C5
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0x28DCF08F
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0xBB5744C4
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0x794C2558
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x2664A4A0
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x3268A969
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0xF98ABD10
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x39D6B7C2
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x87DF09ED
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xFAC40A46
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x6DBB31EF
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x69DFE3EC
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x5BCB22F7

0x8D5AA8FB
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x2EEE3D75
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x7C81797F
entered.
0x237A71EB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x6C8912D3
be ready: will you come down?"
0x2F377E91

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x3DDBECE6
carry it upstairs."
0xD17E225D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You'll have some meat?"
0x06BFFB5D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0xE04B1B84

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the sago?"
0xC404D303

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0x0370D057
make it myself."
0x5124E5B3

0x8D5AA8FB
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0xA287152C
so I departed.
0x2304A194

0x8D5AA8FB
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x4106CD9A
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x94701B78
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0xF88FEDBF
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x15D163A1
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0xB55E1F8A
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xB79FB2F8
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0xCD649D3A
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0xE248C9CE
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x058A6A85
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xEEF08861
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x61D61418
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x8230C06E

0x8D5AA8FB
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x35FC9DFE
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0xE00ABD95
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0x35EF41EA
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x95B583B9
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0xEC8EA98C
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x057886F9
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0xA3C9347E
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0x73AA24EC
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x35227C1C
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0xFC44740C
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0x953DF29A
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0xFC20635A
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0xE9F46ABD
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0x73B2F48E
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x95D365FB
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x81720782
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x9482D879
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x2BE86188
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x73192760
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xB7F8F090

0x8D5AA8FB
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0xA52B51CB
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x9FB7F6F7
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x8A33F16E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x0C608484
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xA4DC5B6E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0x699916D6
thinking.
0xD9324C2C

0x8D5AA8FB
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0xEE80B73E
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xA06239E6
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x4342E5F0
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0x1B6A127B
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0xE91FDAA9
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0xEABE8D15

0x8D5AA8FB
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xE8D1C918
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x85C440FF
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0x7BB06713
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x808F26C5
impatient."
0xFC32AB83

0x8D5AA8FB
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0xD75813A6
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0xA89294E9
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0xE2EF3116
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x69FC374C
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0xC5A68EDA
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x8873DDA4
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x91E5535B
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x91882491
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x464079B2
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x7622F3EA
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x595E2003
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x21E0036B
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0xA4E03139
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x4BCC0D9D
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0x8BE01E0A
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0x740DBC62
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0xD66B2E16
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x42827C43
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x47763182

0x8D5AA8FB
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x2ADDE285
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0xDE35AE76
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0xA08344B3
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x60F8DD69

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x0EE36A1A
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xD998CD1F
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x9120ED4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x05B375D1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x930126CB
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x7D3D6F4B
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0xE20FF550
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x6C4FB53F
deepening into total obscurity.
0x7E03C8CC

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0xBBB20D8D
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x8751D6AC
his journey."
0x35411648

0x8D5AA8FB
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x47217ED1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0xB6BCB808
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x6EE87EB8
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x492B24F0
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x265CE2B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x2D4CFA85

0x8D5AA8FB
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xD00EE6D6
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0xF8269B40
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x694F61D7
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x24E3694A
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0x436101C8
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xC9419DD3
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x488322F5
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x39A5D5CD
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xB631E4B6
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0xCE5490AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0xE12DC646

0x8D5AA8FB
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x205B9DB7
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x96DD5671
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0xF8D490AD
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x3343FAF0
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x02C2B998
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0x16D6EB7F
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0xE85953EC
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0x3684E524
the evening."
0x9A73DCCF

0x8D5AA8FB
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x7607B549

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x19D1979D
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xE301B015
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xF9706D31
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x38811216
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x2D30FE29
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0xF551B45D
was certainly the queen."
0x25C5204F

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what was she like?"
0xCCAF90D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xE771614A
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x2D7C5E15
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xE41CA6A5
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x663D5953
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0xAED65CC6
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0xDC06CF54
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x2CC43343
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x8F4166D2
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x83710307
jetty mass of her curls."
0xBE1D4833

0x8D5AA8FB
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x13BEDF19

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0xB97A858E
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0xB7C539F3
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x5AC5A476

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0x474AD935

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0xD5CACBD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0x8245D6DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0xF8DCB440
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x914233F5
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x6A2C5D1F

0x8D5AA8FB
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0xC74F0412

0x8D5AA8FB
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0xC14FF5C4
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0x61421532
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0x4AE157CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x9ABF4EE1
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x633ED57C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0xDE7FAF04
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0x5221705C

0x8D5AA8FB
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0x90195B46

0x8D5AA8FB
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0xA76D1180
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0x53EF3BC2
began tea."
0x20D972E2

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0x6E276C90

0x8D5AA8FB
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x094DA030
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x61AFAFFE
conversation was turned into another channel.
0xD458E1E4

0x8D5AA8FB
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0xE405D9F6
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0xB91CA62A
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x3E8E5052
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0x82766AF2

0x8D5AA8FB
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x2864F544
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x06A7D512
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x76A9B691
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0xA9F2B515
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0xA000F3DE
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x1CF3E7C9

0x8D5AA8FB
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0xC42FCC39
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0xEA126674
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x8213CAEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xD5C9DB31
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0xEE45129B
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x01A44AC6
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x280742FB
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0xECA72BA8
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x7CA5C50A
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xFA40E10F
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0x811182A7
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0xD121AED4
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0x4707144B
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x5E941AEA
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0xCE8FB26C
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x1ACBBBA9
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x61EF74E8
is no extrication.
0x08DFDBB4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0xA84583D1
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0x1D7CDCDD
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x0384C0BD
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x752F0512
poor, and plain.'
0x84501B80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0xF577DCAB
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xD86B6A61
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x87F4BD3D
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0x50A5D8A3
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x6F8E4CFC
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0xD144E167
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x765EFE84
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x9CB46A95
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0xA1947782
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x62202099
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0xA1A731F3
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0xA5F835AB
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xC098BDD2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0x5E7A8683
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x57B9AB30
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x24EB68FA
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0xA94B490C
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x230436FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x4D0E3A53
calm, and fell asleep.
0x4FDCDCDA

0x8D5AA8FB
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0x53821222
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x1A71CE58
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x259B5765
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0xF094F5B5
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0xE5052628
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0xA4EC7D1C
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x12AE2F53

0x8D5AA8FB
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x42D9359B
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x4F209A18
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x2B01C818
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0xE126A3E3
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0x0BEDA812

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xBBA13749
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0xC1EAAB8B
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xBAD62DE5
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xACA51176
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0x296D0AAE
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0xA1B06786
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0xEB67B936
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x0F84826D
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xCA6EC009
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x56B05896
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x4B69DDC2
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xCD2FA393
on the contrary, I just said--
0x0CD8C21D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x91D0A247
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x67B68B11
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xAE6A7472
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0xA306B6EA
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x1FF6AEAD
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xC0B2C34A
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x09847829
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0xC7603622
wanted and would be despised."
0xE16549F0

0x8D5AA8FB
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0xA112B16E
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0xBB18D472
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x71D23E35
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x3871BFBE
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0xA13C316A

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0xF90739B6
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x605FEBFD

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x68AE5EAA
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x5BF506FE

0x8D5AA8FB
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x38CDAA87
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x26298446
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x0E0BB3A0
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0xFA349CBA
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0x9EFF1F06

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0xCF5CAC63
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x9A2608AC
holding the note before her spectacles.
0xF8475E79

0x8D5AA8FB
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0xDD5170B1
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0xAB24A9CC
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0xB3B11A20

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x668F8FBB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x6B718FE9
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x71281381
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0xCA2FF085
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0xFCB05145
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x5C42AC1D
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x3B1B9022
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x3F302F5E
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x997690A2

0x8D5AA8FB
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x5B263618
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x2752B88E
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x93FCD199
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0xF482A2D6
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x12838414
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0x220D768D
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x5CA6493D
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0x863A1C57
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0xA81D2A51
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x3B35D336
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0xBE1ED3F0
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x71304E10
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x7FD5B3C2
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0xB2788672
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0xCA4F14DA
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0xAABD00A8
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0xE33E9221
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0xC8A3C63B

0x8D5AA8FB
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0x2CF53254
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x4822D0BA
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0xCB28D0DA
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x3F37C53B
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x42E4305A
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x0413F627
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x0EC72077
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x1183B819
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0x219F143F
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x56757B92
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0xA5DB2C0D
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x373B3766
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0xF2A6F690
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x1B609C1D
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0xFA7EF9B1
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0xF511B050
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0xFA12CAAB
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x41FED765
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x270874D4
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x9E315297

0x8D5AA8FB
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x013BBA9A
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0xB0F07031
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x591BB876
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x8FC186EC
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x7492DE3E
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0xF7369522

0x8D5AA8FB
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x2A606C62

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0xB4901633
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x7CA29F15
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0xB009DBFB
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0xEC14A777
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x01605985
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xF00AEBD7
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x83E88CF1

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x355A4FA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0xEEFA454A
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0x13D1737A
the money she gets."
0xCD0C05DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x0369CB89

0x8D5AA8FB
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x5803C784
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0x3B7DEB6E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x3B411FAA

0x8D5AA8FB
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x684FD09C
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0xDB84A071
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x9DA5FAD7
excluded.
0xF27ADA55

0x8D5AA8FB
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0x6FCF0F50
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0xB8154CB6
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xC68E156A
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x4B2B61F8
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x60524F94
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x2FBF1A93
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0xDA8304AD
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0x2AD6BD93
sides.
0xB3D93BFE

0x8D5AA8FB
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0xB2A7AB37
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xACAEAB37
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x3D26BEA6
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0x6FF9464F
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0xFF835A45
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x28733090
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x7A1AF462
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0xB57E0E1F
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0xD72E0E7E

0x8D5AA8FB
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0xEE260CA2
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0xA5E7EF84
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x43E22D89
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0x1EBEBCE0

0x8D5AA8FB
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0xD77397FF
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x5AEF5315
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xE80F3C7E
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x02B1300C
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0xA14133CE
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x28AF3311

0x8D5AA8FB
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x2EACBF29
minutes."
0xB0A965B1

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0xA3951325
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x1928A0B2

0x8D5AA8FB
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0xD8B5A4F7
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x443F2A32
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x58A96473
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0x9EFBDB67
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x4091EE87
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0x80A5A981
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0xDC926D70
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x8F98F213
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0xD0F2AD67

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xFB575E0D
below.
0xDAFF5188

0x8D5AA8FB
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0x4420B1A7
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x2DE3FBE7
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x96373ADB
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0x6392711F
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x4A13AC06
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x26795798
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0xC522F43A

0x8D5AA8FB
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x078D99AB
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x564FBA88
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0xCA4BBF49
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x2B3973D4
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0xBB6FB5BB
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x9460E3E2
and, for a time, a hush.
0xCF096EA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0xE7AB7387
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x43C165BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xAE388F99
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0xA31F73AE
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0x7088DB49
on apprend."
0x5647E825

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0x443C412B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0x83FB200A
mange."
0x6C570167

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xCC8499A2
get you something to eat."
0xC9076E1F

0x8D5AA8FB
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x86992DCF
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xF2B42502
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x9DD20386
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0x78E656A5
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0xFCD099E7
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x25E3F827
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0xCE121354
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0xFB9ACE9C
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x7F3BBA63
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0x20E1110E
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x1B5805DA
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x1A7DEA26
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xBDCC443D
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0x4ED290F5
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x77C0EB11
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x5E3A197E
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0xCA21F5E4

0x8D5AA8FB
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x8093CF24
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x7E855394
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x0425C6CA
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x8AEF83DC
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x085D283D
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0x7CFCB5BD
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x9FB13BCC

0x8D5AA8FB
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x64866936
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x994B4B8E
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x20B8AA9A
dinner?"
0xC886DCA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0x1CD10113
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x3D0C3609
is your dinner."
0xC44C8C08

0x8D5AA8FB
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x5BFF4964
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x206CEFD4
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x11362E2E
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0xE16B1081
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0xDA916B02
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0xDD4B4D0C
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0xF8F519D9
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x32201C7A
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xBA6550CD
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0x03A8E7D7
quel dommage!"
0x6F09FBBF

0x8D5AA8FB
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x65F4E480
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x04D77D00
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x2D9626AD
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xF6F6EACD
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0xFBCF4D2B
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x4AE12F92
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x121DDD21
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0xFFA79D29
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x290EC1E1
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x257D7E1A
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x136C572A
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x12910C22
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x043D2FF7
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xCBD8B58E

0x8D5AA8FB
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0xCB146B52
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x184F145F
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0xFE1E5898
sought their chambers.
0xF5401D1A

0x8D5AA8FB
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0xE8E9547D
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0xF947DE58
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x2C262B9B
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0xF1BFDCD9
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x9DBC6F88
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x120048E9
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x8AE1175D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x10519BF0
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x920ACACA
ladies."
0xD6CB306E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x7141A2BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0x184BDADC
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xF024FB54
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x77628DEC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x7546EA16
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0x3587B20D
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x3C4DE255
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xE66C48DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0x3D3A7A93
answered.
0x824F5735

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0xC286779E
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x1B516F06
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x26EC8BA3
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xC98B9643
case of contumacy.'"
0x592EB9A4

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0xB7E69F26
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x54776D00

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x20D0C147
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xCC48B170
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0x99A3FE22
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0xF4B4F5C2
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xF970C123
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x361CEBC2
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x66074366

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0xCC267C91

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0x7245D482
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0xD0F171B2
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x6BDED9A0
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x59E5987E
stay at Thornfield."
0x28F89C0B

0x8D5AA8FB
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0xE3DA990D
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x008B7097
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0x95F9B999
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x928DCC4D
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x06DE1C17
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x1ED39C88
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xB04B0030
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x55E531AB
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0xA7CB3410
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xFE81652E
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0xC65AFDB4
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xA6A0A18B
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x9DD995E5
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xE69A78BB
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x4A58CFBB
descended.
0xB5126D07

0x8D5AA8FB
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0xD96E0643
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x2DF4D148
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0xC1062218
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0xFF1ABDB2
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xD265EEC7
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x5B2806E4
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x15170116
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x1B850AB3

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0xE76B4B43
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xD8925DAF
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0xE9FFA6FF
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0x59B7FA3B
touched my knee.
0x0D0C9D54

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is it, Adele?"
0x6DD5DD40

0x8D5AA8FB
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x52C74A77
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x4BDFF06C

0x8D5AA8FB
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x52C771CB
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x7AB0C2F4
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x7CDB09D2
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x5454A9D4
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0xE033654A
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x01513D07

0x8D5AA8FB
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xD8461534
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x94268B17
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x5C5BA712
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x8DC4AA5D
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0xCA42E424

0x8D5AA8FB
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x32BA2C37
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xBE017393
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x1C470D74
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0xECA0599A
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0xDB90B780
stared at me.
0xED7FB770

0x8D5AA8FB
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x18C7E157
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0x856E18C8
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x8A06E63A
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x14B36EF2
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0xD96F4230
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0xBC441601
and may as well mention them now.
0x234D9CEC

0x8D5AA8FB
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0x1AB68EBA
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x1CCDE2B3
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xD421AF69
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0xF0CA93C5
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x51380EAF
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0xA7721F89
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0xA479309E

0x8D5AA8FB
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x366DF2B7
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x2D9325B5
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x0269C614
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x0D72AF55

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xF93F4DF1
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0xF9B0E64C
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x24C8C506
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xD97108EE

0x8D5AA8FB
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x1703E8EE
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x9A9C83EB
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x1EF27DB4
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x31BD4206
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x9159EF0B
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x1578E584
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0xA3C986C1
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x04668C55
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0xCA3BE410
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x7588C9FA
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0x1D6C6C76
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0x385012BB
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x6D3348A4
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x7A1472BB
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xB7A78775
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x9845CE64
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xA5CC3B9F
truly imperial dignity.
0x0C4E8626

0x8D5AA8FB
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x9F751C57
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0xAC9E35A1
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x07CEEC22
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0xC224FCEE
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0x6BDE41AA
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x06B3B785
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x4DE3C7F4

0x8D5AA8FB
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x0080F950
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x1176AB93
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x58CA0EFB
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xF9D5B1CF
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x59393F08
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x343A723F
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x9BF3785C
haughty lip.
0x4CE6C1B2

0x8D5AA8FB
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0xC667DC9D
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x814433FE
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0xB047CF2F
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x10931AF8
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0xF35E5CD2
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xB5AEC4E6
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0xCA5B3709
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x99B749B3
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x5464B0F3
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xF7071720
with fluency and with a good accent.
0xDE92C4D4

0x8D5AA8FB
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x6361D17D
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0xFDA9182A
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x902DD7EC
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0xCDD48EA2
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x4F761EA2
in spotless white.
0xFA0C45CE

0x8D5AA8FB
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0xE78C4350
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0xFE97F290
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0xDA64EA34
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0xC0129F87
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0xF2F53D1F
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x56BB41A9
together.
0x1DA99B13

0x8D5AA8FB
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x089839EE
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x10C227D7
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x29208F5F
gravity--
0x3C3A4E3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0x70258DCB

0x8D5AA8FB
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x91525865
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0xA8B87703

0x8D5AA8FB
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0xB97ED5BF
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x3B58603F

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x23D81E93

0x8D5AA8FB
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0xE3F1CE66
child!"
0x1B30B9D0

0x8D5AA8FB
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0x692C1243
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x6E451541
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0xC0EBF3B9
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x9FC3AA36

0x8D5AA8FB
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xBA2AAAFB
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x85E202B0
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0xBDFA1115
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0x8433FCE1
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x644B3F5C
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0xB2ADEE20
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x54759745
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x5A7BA7A9
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x89CD9F19
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0xB8A80B04
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0xC8AB58D4
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0x39901DE6
blood or vigour of brain.
0x97A179AF

0x8D5AA8FB
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x69A54A36

0x8D5AA8FB
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x47B32210
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0xB756B402
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x36118373
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x0D6F94D7
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x516AD167
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x678B2FF0
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0xE9C3D0DD
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xD35FFF72
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0x4C6ABE73
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xE346E807
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x8FA31657
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xB7643F20
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x53BD13FA
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0xC9CEBFFA

0x8D5AA8FB
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x7154196D
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0xBAE48F5A
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x587C40D9
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0xBAAF809E
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0x3BC8B2EC
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x87C42BD1
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0x2E8C81C3
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0xA84DE1CE

0x8D5AA8FB
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x08E3E868
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x89E5195E
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0xB2D7859B
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x1C1AD889
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x5CCD3D25
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x8F8B2ECC
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x486F1A37
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x633745D4
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x78C1E3E9
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x1E1EC03B

0x8D5AA8FB
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x717A2E68
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0x3D4C9F8A
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x50F5408C
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x9B1A1A4F
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0x1E0D4547
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xA6EBD7F1
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0xE820129A
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0x2F8413F9
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x6AC5825B
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x26AF0EC3
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0xB7FFACC6
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x880462F8
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x87B7F771
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x70F138B4
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0xC4C54086
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0xC92770C4
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xD20E1783
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0x03E3D607
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x923F2267
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0xE3CBDCF4
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x18A0EE31
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x5563A878
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x5BC29E44
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0x7B78BC4B
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xD6779213
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0xEF8A3169
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0xD263C1D0
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x4E9A725E
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xCB2CA167

0x8D5AA8FB
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x090A5E1B
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x3E4BB0B5
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x36F58854
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0xAF86BEC6
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x2DAC2E49
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0xDF31A9EE
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xC3212D26
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x16F77CF5
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x04127A65
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x7BC95938
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x12FEDF4B
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0xA92E3A02
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0x0DB2D021
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x04E34E9A
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x557009D1
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0x7C2ED88E
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x175267B3
selects a mate.
0x9CAC3C26

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x33ECEF3B
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0xF036AAB1
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0x55D3BFC3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x817325AC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nor am I."
0x6462D8DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x8348CEDC
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0xB00C4F92

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x625188B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You should have sent her to school."
0x8D3C5739

0x8D5AA8FB
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0x2C67CFA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0x06AF4CC5
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x21E4B4B2
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x3E153B3B
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0x58881EFC

0x8D5AA8FB
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xFDB00820
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x0462A75E
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0xC5F714D2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0xEBF2EDEC
straight before him.
0x17445B87

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0xCCCA1F37
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0xF10E4565
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x4D9D807C
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x0A3EA842

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you speak, my own?"
0xE5715939

0x8D5AA8FB
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x75596BAC
her question with an explanation.
0x1F1F4725

0x8D5AA8FB
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0xB4AB33D6
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x53F22A15
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0xE1B2D0EB

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0x55D9AA5E
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0x4B4F45D6
the anathematised race was present.
0x0570985D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0xD2A056D6
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0x5E96B48D
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x0884B64D

0x8D5AA8FB
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0x2A846B7F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x5A794729
three times with portentous significancy.
0x993D3148

0x8D5AA8FB
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0x481326C2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0xAF450629

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0xF5D2D3EA
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x04C84312
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x2E009178
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0xAEAA0407
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0xD246C1E0
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x9F5B3951
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x200D14C4
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x7E868512
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x8C236626
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0xF54EDCDB
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0x59A7F976
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0xB6733E3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0x81796062
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0xC1FFDE22
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x6D1B1FFA
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x002E9FCC

0x8D5AA8FB
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x499BFE02
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x3DC6E3F8
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0xA80495B3
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x7B75C064
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0xB24C1F36
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0x6A6E7722
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xE2D5D02D
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0x94DC08D2
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0x59FF845E
lady-mother?"
0xBC42E6B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0xE8EF2787
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x74D8C41A
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0xFEC264E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0x566E7DEE
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0x3B35B46F
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0xD84E3A86
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0x8B366B1D
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0xBA8D9E25

0x8D5AA8FB
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0xAC32311D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0xC6AEA099

0x8D5AA8FB
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0xB71C0630
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0xA4AAF130
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x0A239A79
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0x5AC3A457

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0x6E0CD439
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x7EB7FF33
she would give us anything we asked for."
0xA216D8AE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0xDA8BCAAF
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0x11E0F710
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0xB203E8D1
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0xB1B968D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x647283A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x98506424
in voice to-night?"
0xE1574113

0x8D5AA8FB
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0x4C77CB06

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0xAF264682
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x75FFC102

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0x7AA3EAEA

0x8D5AA8FB
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0x9FC05386
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xB2EAFFB8
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x2738C283
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0x32765A13
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x36317683
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xB3C8EEEB
hand."
0xA4C955E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0x1C8C2E7E
Mr. Rochester.
0x509CCA93

0x8D5AA8FB
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0x7DFE3FF4

0x8D5AA8FB
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0xFED43D14

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x06628B62
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x2C20428C
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x588CCC08
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x13B71E78
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x85C517DC
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x5DD633EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x53869685
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0x2A00AF87
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0x8AA47502
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x574712ED
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x20ED3F17
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0xAF074BEE
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x32F63A87
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x6216BDF7
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0xAE42B8DF
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x8428FAD7
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0xB42449EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0xF95E07C7
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x0BF3A570
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0x8D94CAD1
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0x6A0AAB5D
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0xE7B3904C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x963A7E43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0xB5A5538D
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0x0D5DF9E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0x8FAED1C3
water."
0x0A62FEAB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0xBB229EB8
such things _should_ be done."
0x0E76962C

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0x7A37B649
fail."
0xDCD88822

0x8D5AA8FB
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0xFC84897F
proportionate punishment."
0x50BBFA8F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x0A9CCED7
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0x65128EAA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xE89E4C29

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0x70A04611
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0x1188B976
capital punishment."
0x7435AD3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0xC8CC98F7
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x821E9ABB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0xC8B92D36
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0x540C0DD9
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0x67B20428
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xCA30403B
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x37F6CD2A
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0xEC7B491E
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x18237FB2
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x68335C80
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x1D08855C
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x851BC4F8
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xF04AB6CC
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0xE6190A94

0x8D5AA8FB
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x0B289EA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am very well, sir."
0xC53124C3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x672BC34F

0x8D5AA8FB
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0xB4B6704C
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x87C88D34

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x3D8FBC5F

0x8D5AA8FB
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0xD15ABDF1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0xE5FA4892

0x8D5AA8FB
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x0EFBC051
What is the matter?"
0x57916D92

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x2AC6047D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0xDE5AB12E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not the least."
0x9221B91B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0xCD827AB9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am tired, sir."
0xF5CC98CC

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked at me for a minute.
0x9E13A5BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x502F99D3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x7BC1661B

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0xFC62FF12
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x61E9F365
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x6FFA971A
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x4A0A5389
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0x68560C91
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0xA41A7E98
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x72696A15
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x147FC063
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
0x8A3D8E0C

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XVIII
0xC621E496

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x22A85A85
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0xCA2E8CB3
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x3D31DA6A
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x44E01711
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x2B3D9996
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x4ACB4B9F
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x727BE2F4

0x8D5AA8FB
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0x378616C7
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xF6CCF32F
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x97EE30A6
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x170E5E20
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xD201769E
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0xFF7B6151
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0xB1EEE8D4

0x8D5AA8FB
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x6C9DE94F
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x6C479D3D
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x16ACC4AA
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x1CBFD71B
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0x5A7CE031
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x5BE2A504
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x9B69DCAC
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x2BFB75C3
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x0E8A4C43
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0xB67A402F
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0xD6E434FB
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0x3F420F89
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x492EAB87
drawing-room.
0x087B12A0

0x8D5AA8FB
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x322E3704
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0xDEC72A87
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0xA87CAF34
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0xD592547D
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x4C2098FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0xE2876C05
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0x6098346D
usual seat.
0x3AD71247

0x8D5AA8FB
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0xA8D667F4
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0xFB9A7DCF
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xBFF8BB1E
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x1B7FEE5E

0x8D5AA8FB
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x186EA9CA

0x8D5AA8FB
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xAC802143
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0xBFD19DA6
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xD156CA97
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x4C8BD20E
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0xD61D442C
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x542FBDF2
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x23E7EAFD
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0x94DCF689
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0xC827C525
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0xFD4D50BD
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0xB0BAEBBC
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x57D0DED4
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x61D9BA73
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x7592AC4E
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x4C8A38F3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0x5478B26E

0x8D5AA8FB
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0x55A6BD89
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x67F9328B
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0xFE881116
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0xCA88ACA4
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x3ADE3D47
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0xD81FBCD5
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x07DB7027
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x48F6707C

0x8D5AA8FB
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x96B3EA26
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x7520E46B
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x0888E5D1
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x7249EC8E
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xA8D07FC0
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x6DA81BFC
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0xBFF39817
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x5E52A152
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0xB2D52111
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x01E3EFC2
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0x8AF93FCC
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x84FBA131

0x8D5AA8FB
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0xCB684782
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0xCCB918F7
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0xE7E7F30E
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0x48BCF950
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0xCE880A4F
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0x8F177EA2
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0xF7043E6C
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x3072745F
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x99FBCF71
wanting.
0xA3314E85

0x8D5AA8FB
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x07742F2B
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x5339D674
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0xABAF7A35
curtain again descended.
0x3968A76F

0x8D5AA8FB
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0xD0A49457
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x12832B1F
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0x77765E3F
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0x2F27560F
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0x85FBF35D

0x8D5AA8FB
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x80C20B8E
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0xE51F359F
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0xCA1ACB6E
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0x6101CFEC
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0xC015FF38
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x6338CF18
attached fetters.
0xA66CBE3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0x50A4538E

0x8D5AA8FB
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0xD0AA417F
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x867F79DD
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x510580ED

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x56236DE6
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x2D7C0D0D
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x927B6B9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x347A8998

0x8D5AA8FB
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x0D2D1FEF
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x03217CEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0xFCACA129

0x8D5AA8FB
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x1F2CA066
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x73146485

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xFF97B39B
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xF6F32F3E
colour rose.
0xB8D48A98

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0xFF0AE44C
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x6CE8B428
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0x69C8C282
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0xA7EA0F0B
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x4679C012
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0x7F8AA9E5
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x1576CC5F
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0xC0A22E18
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0x997A51BB
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0x6C1FB4E3
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xE561B45C
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x255DFCC9
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xB6C6E2C1
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0xB3240716
returns in memory at this moment.
0x5F2197F6

0x8D5AA8FB
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0xB51D5479
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0xD856E3F6
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0xAF7D303D
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0xCB2B3F76
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0x04FB80D2
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x2C63B90B
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0xC31BCF3D
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x2169F43F
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0xD0A91E80
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0xE18CA7A8
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x9C808685
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0xD99B0743
very pride, irresistible.
0x10A06A91

0x8D5AA8FB
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xA57CFFD0
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0xEF4BAB7B
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x693C61AE
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0xF3A8E782
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x7F5DA7F8
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0x322269A9
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xA4633B36
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x81E2BA18
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x5988D917
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x92905632
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x3FD7DE31
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xBC506725
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x87808EC0
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x83987523
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x84B2F0E4
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xE3C7DAD8
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x8F1ED29C
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x72D59697
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0xE7971946
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0xB4C9B27B
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0x85124262
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x055812BB
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x57D14E3B
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x4FA7445B
torturing pain arose.
0x8A3E9B2C

0x8D5AA8FB
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0xF7055E9F
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0xCE2F4405
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0xC16AC19F
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x8625BAE0
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0xC0837F6D
not charm him_.
0x69489E8D

0x8D5AA8FB
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x935F5A3B
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x9E29A6AF
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x79E576B8
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x743EFEA9
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x576C98FA
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x2116450B
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x8AA9E98D
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x5F3859E1
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x77977B9C
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x6A7859D1
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x98F625B6
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xFBAF3760
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x9DBEE7A4
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x237ED7B5
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x25D5F50D

0x8D5AA8FB
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0x7568CDE8
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0x7C50DC28
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0x693A99A7
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x66796A10
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x25F90D96
silent conquest might have been won.
0xA832C039

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xEEA6255C
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0x6CBE5D51
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x46C7E4A2
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x878E25FA
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xBBDD20B3
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0x22517318
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xA13A477A
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x7D92E9FB
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0xBB373049
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xE2A75214
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0xE6107422
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x184E14ED
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0x1901E002
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x0294B88D
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0xED4E9402
shines on."
0x52D7746D

0x8D5AA8FB
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0xAC91EA25
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x3812C6CB
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xBFC39C04
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xA2E6FEFC
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x9B4942B7
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0xA83BACC2
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x71F14714
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x25A70130
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x46304CE3
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x249E3FD2
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xD82EF833
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x9290ADAC
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x1E004F9E
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x400021B3
as I wished to act.
0x176245B4

0x8D5AA8FB
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0xF400D75B
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x03D43681
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0xDE999471
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x27C78651
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x7B71AF91
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x905F9210
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0xBC58C009
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x37F28DE9
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x9A4ABBDC
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0xB54A5443
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x92D18D0C
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x762020BB
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x520B8B78
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x67793A69
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x8E1BC396
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x0B7B2BD6
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x5CD494BD
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x69E312E6
nature.
0x5E16F842

0x8D5AA8FB
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x70CF8C83
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xE2B5BEC5
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x243F9574
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x0925B889
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x8D781BA8
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x360A1591
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0x72149D29
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0xE9F4972C
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0xB33E0AAF
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0x9A5F99E9
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x8AA19AA4
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x9FCA5F38
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0xB5D3E57C
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xC499CD2D
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x6548F7DF
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x1F387121
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x667A321A
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0xE8794EED
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x59D27193
vivacity of conversation.
0x9AF51612

0x8D5AA8FB
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x1CEECFE1
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x30781D28
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x070AFD55
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x4BAFBA79
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x94DFD7EB
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0xB6C90BF0
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0xA4A1892F
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0xF9D29921
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0x48F99F77
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xE966F1A2
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x3A5FE6A9
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x807DF996
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xD9AC8DE4
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x3DD8F933
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x27DAECFA

0x8D5AA8FB
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x34949ACB
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0x433A2212
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x44D0EC63

0x8D5AA8FB
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x34CC605B

0x8D5AA8FB
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0x1752835F
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x8218850C
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xD0C82D64
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0xA9F701C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0xCF8B30A0
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0xFAA1D611
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0xE2E096C9

0x8D5AA8FB
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x80476B2D
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0xF71A643C
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x80E3EDF8
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0xB34E0BA1
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0xCB80121F
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0x40C29580
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0xF1673148

0x8D5AA8FB
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x7F90B08C
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x3F963A5F
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xA98464AC

0x8D5AA8FB
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0xCA5C1E59
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0x73972AD3

0x8D5AA8FB
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0xF2E67EEA
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x4229B28A
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0xF4AE99A0
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x08BEEAF3

0x8D5AA8FB
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0xAB26BA12
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0xE6B2C178
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0xECE89C2D
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x2DCDBF9F
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0xCCC05C7D
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x909039B4
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x0BF04237
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0xB7ABCC7E
least so I thought.
0x62C4C4DC

0x8D5AA8FB
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0xBDD41E81
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xC32BF25F
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x4CC391FC
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0x4DB96EF1
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0xD9EDB29C
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0xB45C6739
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x65205C67
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x5EE3B910
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xE0DEF704
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0x17B78321

0x8D5AA8FB
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x0A745910
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x45803894
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x4A3E68DA
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x8ADC8A6C
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x7CE3ED97
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x6921080A
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0xB3DC629D

0x8D5AA8FB
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xED582EB7
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x05206A72
that "extremes meet."
0x79F82C7F

0x8D5AA8FB
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0x3D3606DE
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0xDE25AF61
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0xB3EA47BF
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0xDD11C3F2
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x084E8374
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x081FD0C2
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0xFD0FB5D5
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0xD7608533

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0xB3B6EFAA
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x57C15901
a placid eye and smile!"
0x33D84DDB

0x8D5AA8FB
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x31A6200E
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x04960B31
Hay Common.
0x6CB732A8

0x8D5AA8FB
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x57599808
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x113D43A9
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0x7D0FBE1C
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x26711480
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x689FD622
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0x0D7D1EAD
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x031E33EB
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xEDFEC479
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x3F43A22C
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0x38E3D4F5
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0xEFCA47FE
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xB6D902AA
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0x3E29012E

0x8D5AA8FB
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x5CFE5AAF
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x28BE93BF
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0xB32A892C
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0x1FD8C01D
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x8B331473
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0xE67A880C
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0x5FA993C2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0x7DD1852C
off," replied the magistrate.
0xEBBD49B8

0x8D5AA8FB
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0x0FB06B0A
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x76745E8D
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0xF1153AA4
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0x072855C3
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0xFF594D3B
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0x2B90A77D
see her?"
0xD0298F4C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0xF9A0751A
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x429A0791

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0xACFAB3CE
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x4C72E81A
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0xF250A113
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x5DD6BF9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x6A78CB14

0x8D5AA8FB
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x1C26D013
must and will do it."
0xCC618853

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x06A1CC4C

0x8D5AA8FB
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0x7B0BE058

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0x15C56259
in, of course."
0xDD88AB46

0x8D5AA8FB
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x76EB9FF0
throw away such a chance of fun."
0xB862E49E

0x8D5AA8FB
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x43323031

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x9DE61954
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xBF5B42A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x1BC9A48F
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x90A2E24C
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x4A5DC12F
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0xDF52AA46
forward."
0x83E77014

0x8D5AA8FB
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x68189164

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x906E9F19
Sam!"
0x27804D0D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x59F22313
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x3180B287

0x8D5AA8FB
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x20CA8813

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0xFEC70F05

0x8D5AA8FB
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x22471C73
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0x0EFE7017

0x8D5AA8FB
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0xA0CBE252
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x1FA88843
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x4C442D1C
one."
0xCC34B4A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x494E76B7
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x60AFDF62

0x8D5AA8FB
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0xB191C998
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x00E46485
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x472000EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0xFB28D4F2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x28B6CB2A

0x8D5AA8FB
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x322B0E4D
once more.
0x13E9C921

0x8D5AA8FB
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0xBA891083
know who will be her first visitor."
0x4CDDB247

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x17840133
said Colonel Dent.
0x3033058C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x70A91FA5

0x8D5AA8FB
Sam went and returned.
0xB8250E5A

0x8D5AA8FB
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0xA4A0958E
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x47BB83CA
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x2F0A26C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0xB1D74BB6

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0xDED61C5C
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x6790447E
of his men.
0x8EBC5FF6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xF5EF8E1B
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0xF3698606
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x2FBE6AD5

0x8D5AA8FB
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0x32816D71
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x81267E2E
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0xCC991AA6
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x1452C6D1

0x8D5AA8FB
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x9BC35993
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0xF5CC0296

0x8D5AA8FB
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x023DAD22
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0x18445104
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x21B10580
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x7D826F04

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x0637D8E7

0x8D5AA8FB
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x802A6AAA

0x8D5AA8FB
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0xB47D6C6E
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xF74009FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0xB275D1E2
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x2096DAB9
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0x1AECB1B2
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0xC825B1CD
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x508EBEDE
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x7B8209FA
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x711A0783
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xBF31C25F
morning, as he threatened."
0xEFE4CFE8

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0xE82F3D1A
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x8281201E
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x822F49AD
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x5C2C8C7F
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0xC9C8F084
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0xA48A996B
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x83F930F5
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xAFE571E7

0x8D5AA8FB
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x429779A8

0x8D5AA8FB
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0xBDB461F8
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xE77B37E2
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0xCFB0FA15
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x65F19794
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0xF30AA950
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0xF5852D4F

0x8D5AA8FB
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0x0D1472FE
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xFF5DE8B1
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xB5B57380
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0xFA26384D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0x624C4DB5
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x60F86DC9
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0xCC7F707F

0x8D5AA8FB
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xBA9A3D87
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0xC4284033
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x81B5DB59
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x406EFBC8
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0xD25D72B0
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0xD2E85A16
they most wished for.
0x3A8332EC

0x8D5AA8FB
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x070E9B59
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x9665B3A8
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0xD994E5DA
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0x9793DBBA
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x6007C9B9
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xE83CCF05
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x16ABAB69

0x8D5AA8FB
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0xE09E770D
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x30E0085E
saw Sam.
0x32E584FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x451FDB78
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xB26EAA16
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0xE4B0125A
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0x9EAB90E4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0xF7C108FB
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x9A4925BF
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x22BDF967
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xCE3CB35F
quietly behind me.
0xF30E4A49

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0xF07286E3
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x818B3896

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x650A3322
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x99AC5401

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XIX
0xD93C3F50

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x6E2A7918
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0x25475D7A
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0xB407752E
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x948D963C
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0x3816E29D
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0x9A0C3E4E
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0x8EFC51DA
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0xED05361E
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x76841146

0x8D5AA8FB
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x1386D8C9
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x4D7797B0
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0xD4CF5333
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x4D04E85A
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x820F2404
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x7C09746F
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x5C13CE5D
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0xBF6F9854
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xF85BD5EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x92A41F33
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0x9B1E7448

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0x590ED191
warn you, I have no faith."
0x9F92C7EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0xBF03F7B4
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0xC2E8DED2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0x84936B2B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x0DB774FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"You need them all in your trade."
0x4A23FCCF

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0xFF2DA769
you tremble?"
0x4B0DFC8D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'm not cold."
0x0254E479

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0x81B1EB96

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am not sick."
0xA8A64798

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0x6B0BD0D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'm not silly."
0xC2C002E7

0x8D5AA8FB
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x21AE55C1
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x0B93B437
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x1A7EE3A0
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x3B251C01
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x262FFD61

0x8D5AA8FB
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0x21A63121

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x27802A97
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x61827B6A
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0xF25CC74A
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x53F86B51
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x9308B76B
you."
0xC2BECC6C

0x8D5AA8FB
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x67942FD9
with vigour.
0x689C041B

0x8D5AA8FB
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0xC27421E1
solitary dependent in a great house."
0xA90A4190

0x8D5AA8FB
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0xCB77A9DA
one?"
0xA1B35717

0x8D5AA8FB
"In my circumstances."
0xF41A1956

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x23AE9BAF
placed as you are."
0xAEEAED17

0x8D5AA8FB
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x45A71CE2

0x8D5AA8FB
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0x12539732
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x2662CE5C
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0xBC9321F3
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0x439AD24D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0x28B4A3B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0x4710A7AA

0x8D5AA8FB
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x4E64B21F

0x8D5AA8FB
"To be sure."
0x366902D3

0x8D5AA8FB
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x2A3EC916
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xF6CCE44F
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0x33DE2355
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0xCF25A587

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xEFD7BDA7
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x085FC25F
there."
0x62E72D52

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe you," said I.
0xBC99CCAF

0x8D5AA8FB
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x4843F722
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0xC0AAE5E4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x826BDD50
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0x931DA2F2

0x8D5AA8FB
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x847431E1
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0xED626E87
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x4CEE2DA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0xC2F0E2E7
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0xE0DAA96C
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0x07B3EAEF
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x1F5BE47A
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0xE08AABD1
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0xBD325C3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0x8E999760

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xA321A32D
whispers of the future?"
0xC9E71E80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x8505780B
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0xBCAEFB95

0x8D5AA8FB
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0xC38E9B7D
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x919EC5C4

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have learned them from the servants."
0x3D6AE9B6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0x0AC45D47
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0xEC780AA0

0x8D5AA8FB
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0xD1C86D64

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0xEDF81B0C
after all, then!"
0xE4209E6C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0x04B69215
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0xF5E1E4F3
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x74138931
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0x70871D65
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0xEFCD343F
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0x8194FA99

0x8D5AA8FB
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x2495E0BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0xD51D0712

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0xC4265317
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0x555D89F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0xD0FB03B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0xB172D042
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0x9A44B762

0x8D5AA8FB
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0x356775B8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0x39C8FD0A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x7C03E6E5
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x13758AE0
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0xB87A756A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I what?"
0x4AF8598A

0x8D5AA8FB
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0xF10A4FD7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x3E2A7110
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0xB5AD790B
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0x8940E8A1
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x39F159D3
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0x90AF0580
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0x0A93B0BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0x1E263EFE
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x2764E748

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is not at home."
0x2A104DF5

0x8D5AA8FB
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0xEAABC547
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x32C74F97
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x9734D7E3
it were, out of existence?"
0x509FF3B6

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0x70FFBEA1
you had introduced."
0xC2DAFC02

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0xBA16A61F
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0xF40CCC19
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0xCE7F564E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0x3AC10E89

0x8D5AA8FB
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0x5BEB96E3
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0xA67E5F0D
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0x1497D1C5

0x8D5AA8FB
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0x118E2C65
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0x14DCE1D7
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0x81CA2877
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x0383887B
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0x1A862CCC
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0x919E85AC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0x024490FF
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0xCD3E5EA1
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0x975A983E
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0x226DB9D3
noticed this?"
0x9BC070D1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x29356B24

0x8D5AA8FB
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0xC03D5596
gratitude?"
0xE216C1AC

0x8D5AA8FB
I said nothing.
0x9D3B0CF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x9F8E6B0D
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0x07D1DAB0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0x715127B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0xC6936F60

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0x57692C43
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0xC839AC0E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0xD5EBF400

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shortly?"
0x111E5AAD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0x71AAA9F2
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0x5A523C2B
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0xEED59CA7
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x0FD0E1E8
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0xD3B3D375
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0x69C39736
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0xC0835E7A
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0xE66356D9
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0x6E52C570
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0x914739B2

0x8D5AA8FB
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0xB86F1D2E
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0x4A92D647

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0x62F59EAE
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0x99EEA511
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0xB779FA10
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x224FF220
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0x306E9F70
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0xB6F21936

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0x459753D0

0x8D5AA8FB
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0x70A26EC0
p190.jpg}
0x0E95784F

0x8D5AA8FB
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x83923E77
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0x260CEEDE

0x8D5AA8FB
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0xBAAE5798
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0x69F2B6EC
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0xF47624C4
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0x54F177AC
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x31CA0F48
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0xFC03926D
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0x70E69458
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0x28F074A8
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xBF39E8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0x3EF3E682
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0xA3A07954
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0xFA71F2D5
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0xECF5C826
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0x954D011D
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0xC0668640

0x8D5AA8FB
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0xC44FA5B8
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0x3EB608E8
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0xEC8A80E3
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0xD72680E7
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0xA2611979
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0x7F27018C
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0x56940915
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0x68F60B76
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x5D9EB3CE
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0xEEDC51A5
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0x78F9A31D
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x25BDFCCA
dictates of conscience.'
0x5C7EA4E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x245EF339
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0x56525C0F
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0xC8FADEAC
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0x2B0F4FAB
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0x2E29E6D4
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0x43E7BBBB
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0xC078D047
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0xFBD345F7
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0x22215D5D
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0x3F74AAF7
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0xB28B3720
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0xEB54120A
me; the play is played out'."
0x98CF69C5

0x8D5AA8FB
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x01D4DE8D
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0x02068D25
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0x728807E2
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x0CB974FB
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0xC1F2684C
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0xF4BE6453
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x741B9FDA
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0xF455946D
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0x348C325C
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0x01FFE1C3
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0x10D301DF
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x67EE9F25
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0x8619220E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x5FFD6C1F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0x51BA17A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x0B5982D4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Break it, sir."
0x47572722

0x8D5AA8FB
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x3E7065A4
disguise.
0x3B8BB5CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0xCE30BFED

0x8D5AA8FB
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0xFFDECE4B

0x8D5AA8FB
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x5ABF9602

0x8D5AA8FB
"But not with you?"
0x875519E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0xC70561A3

0x8D5AA8FB
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0xC5DD95E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x3CECF08D
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0xA9F309FA
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x0E91D7C4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0x151C757A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x3C28D5C8
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x9DFC1E43
but it was not right."
0xED586D0D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0x5F1B0036

0x8D5AA8FB
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0xE1B32E85
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x26E2261E
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0x26C2944C
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0x6A715E43
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0xB6B42CAB
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xBDD70C56
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xE503EDEC
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x5A051F76

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x101FE91B
signify?"
0x1B715532

0x8D5AA8FB
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0xDDFEB4FB
now, I suppose?"
0xCBA3F1A0

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0x819F7182
yonder are doing."
0xE99831D4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0x60A7B5E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0xB4F49D35

0x8D5AA8FB
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0xCCE61989
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0x49A5248C
left this morning?"
0x9A09681F

0x8D5AA8FB
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0xA96443E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x64377E04
installing himself here till you returned."
0x3F334C4E

0x8D5AA8FB
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x8F587EC2

0x8D5AA8FB
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0xCD33BE64
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x9242AC7E

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0xA0F76FC1
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x4AEABD67
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x69EB6FAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x0A39AC8B
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x5A73642C
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x430AB36B
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0xA5C2D4DA
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x80D46D9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0x76774972

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0xE21E87A4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x9C362795

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0xAACD9343

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0xBA19EC49

0x8D5AA8FB
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x478EC42D
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0x2FF51423
and dreary look.
0xC667E9E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0xD3A3910A
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x01467D6F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x363BC626

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x860B159C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0xCF6A0ED1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x0DC292BE
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x632FD33C
doing."
0x8801C899

0x8D5AA8FB
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x175EFE94
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0xEDE19457
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x75C09276
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x3261D081
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0x1561E189
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x9D32C18E
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0x47ABE669
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xA0874D50
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0xE6CDC787

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x0BDCB657
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x3755BEB2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x6B79BE46
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x52165706

0x8D5AA8FB
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0xDEC0B4B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x229E3E50
strange?"
0x92CABAA1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x5A66740C

0x8D5AA8FB
"And Mason?"
0x802E8A80

0x8D5AA8FB
"He was laughing too."
0x46A12999

0x8D5AA8FB
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xB24BCA0E
Jane?"
0xCD16E070

0x8D5AA8FB
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x0D3E4770

0x8D5AA8FB
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x4E16E0CB
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x1B049945
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x7BD2760F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x847A050B
you."
0xC2BECC6C

0x8D5AA8FB
"To comfort me?"
0xEB89D00A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x96FF1B4A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x233CB1CF

0x8D5AA8FB
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x9C7EB287
care nothing about it."
0xD0CB5F03

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x358D1EC7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x82B79539
you, I am sure, do."
0x98D48509

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0x6DF066F5
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0xE0B06F8A
and then leave me."
0xAB765EE5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xC32ADCFB
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0xB3856760
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x2EEC10F5

0x8D5AA8FB
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0xC07F3AC9
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x79915611
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x730AB6C3

0x8D5AA8FB
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0xE6A141F2
asleep.
0x8DDFE370

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XX
0xD7026F14

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0x866B5CB5
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x63FA13B0
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xE0FF40A8
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0xFA9F5CF1
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0xB7F127DA
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x73290DF9
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0xB581460C
the curtain.
0xFF30E682

0x8D5AA8FB
Good God!  What a cry!
0x31F20EAC

0x8D5AA8FB
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x648ECAA1
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x2BDEF2D0

0x8D5AA8FB
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0x2476806C
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x687D2379
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0xA5438485
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xAFCF727E
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x6D14987F
it could repeat the effort.
0x39B39D77

0x8D5AA8FB
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0x19759B15
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x2CD5127E
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0xC47D4CA7
voice shouted--
0x7AD91F80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x7B2F9D27

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0xD2A47614
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0xC0502160

0x8D5AA8FB
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xE1AA4AC5

0x8D5AA8FB
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xF6DBF36C
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0x0F9FF2E9
was silence.
0x85EE765B

0x8D5AA8FB
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0x38784283
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x8CF1CE02
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x2465E9BF
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0xE5D6571E
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0xD5840108
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x463EFEED
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0xF4D50208
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x91857834
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x393C8B6A
confusion was inextricable.
0x0AE71726

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0xD1400B05
in his bed."
0xBF66DBF6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xE680689C
coming."
0xE1A06459

0x8D5AA8FB
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x66CFC4E1
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0xBE195792
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x08AC4958

0x8D5AA8FB
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x248BB12E
worst at once!"
0x75B48CD8

0x8D5AA8FB
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x57F2842E
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xFCE88D65
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xA0837D84

0x8D5AA8FB
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x5F702707
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x209C290C

0x8D5AA8FB
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0x5E03721F
by an effort, he added--
0x38566D68

0x8D5AA8FB
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x124B7A93
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x88E1B510
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x7BDAC441
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0xAEF3DFDA
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0xE1EEF325
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x541F0339
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0xEFE74C97
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0xC4727E6F
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x992327E6

0x8D5AA8FB
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x340BCFF9
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0xBF6E3168
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x2C4AA8A4
had left it.
0xE3095782

0x8D5AA8FB
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x7F0B8E8E
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x5342C4AE
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x6299D5CA
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0xE555646C
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xD4F673F4
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0xDA957232
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x52BA3C36
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x9EA3DC3E
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0xAB4CF356
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x389E7B35

0x8D5AA8FB
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0xF30F4D03
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0xCE416556
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0xE0BDEB85
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x6D0B1029
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x5A5F568D
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0xA1029AD6
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0xCBBFE61E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0xEC16CAC4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x29E6F21C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And dressed?"
0xD1E215C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x1CA06007

0x8D5AA8FB
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x29FD8CA6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x3003A6E6
noise."
0x902121A8

0x8D5AA8FB
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0xAA3E8AA6
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x8C5F66A8
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x3B853228
side.
0x15F1A8DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0xA7097DBA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x480DC78E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go back and fetch both."
0x0A8B5C94

0x8D5AA8FB
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0xCC36DED4
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x28733254
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x6AEDC4BA
he paused, and addressed me again.
0x16A0D462

0x8D5AA8FB
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0xB9191424

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0x3FAC5C6C

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0xD52AA708

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x39859F56
fit."
0xA93C469A

0x8D5AA8FB
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x8ED8FD64
the key and opened the door.
0xC44DE27C

0x8D5AA8FB
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x9E0BC6FA
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x0E415B17
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x15A5C734
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x588A84BB
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x38075FD2
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x9C424770
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0xE7417B17
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x1E67B889
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0x26B55152
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x768933E5
came out and closed the door behind him.
0xECBDE79C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0xEA9D9195
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0xFF019E2D
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x280F7DD4
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x1EBE1F41
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0xE2FFA8B7
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0xBADBE634
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x805C6FBC
blood.
0xB13BDB9C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x1BF44F20
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0xC3B78523
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0x93DB4B40
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0x695B1244
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x977CCF53
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0x22C1DCA5
blood, trickling fast down.
0x73742B0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x038EB2E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0x12A05590
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0xECB81C6B
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xCA0119AC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir?"
0xAF80061B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0xBAF3EF96
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x6B5FD0DB
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x43DD6143
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0x6AB60E73
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0xB2E26E90
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0xB44564C3
consequences."
0xE3D1A3F8

0x8D5AA8FB
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x308F42C4
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xAFF70CB3
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0xE4E5177A
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x83195C5E
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x66B9DB76
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0xE9383D92
step ceased to be heard.
0xAEA565B5

0x8D5AA8FB
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xD5B9E05E
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0xBF719296
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x89484CAC
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x14464410
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x8642CD7D

0x8D5AA8FB
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x7A6DE163
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x98842A75
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0x7DBAEEE0
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0xFA416675
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0xFDA54CBD
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xAFF8BD99
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0xC5E08A8A
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0x6EC220D8
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x41C5DA6C
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x33A11767
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x42191ACD
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0xC657999E

0x8D5AA8FB
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x03BF7986
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0xA6F2C379
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x20761040
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0xB994C757
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0x42D8C35D
subordinate's form.
0x52C00974

0x8D5AA8FB
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x3BBE9BFB
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0xA52F2096
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0xB3AE62DD
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0x1B00E75A
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x3701C47C

0x8D5AA8FB
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x8E247B83
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0xFDF34C9E
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0xE4C0EDF5
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x3B3CF66B
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x22073610
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xDA6728C5

0x8D5AA8FB
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xB595658C
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x8F450DD4
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x585BEEFC
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x35C41F07
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0xE6C5766C
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0x7074F680
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xBC07E97C
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0xF8C46403
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0xFA469BB2
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xABC14586
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x604EBEE8
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x18D4B26A
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0xD3BF183E
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x608B1C89
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0xD8D04567
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x13F2E0B5
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x140C1ECD
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x9143B9B4
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0x6BEDB3FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0xC9ADAFFE
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0xDFB14930
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0xDCA222EC
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0xC1F48F34
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x472B05D3

0x8D5AA8FB
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0x53970DA4
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x1F19D867
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0xBF058E13
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0xE113C456
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xE8C65B94
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x36B6BD9F
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0x1C7BEF0E
I might not even speak to him.
0xBA650F1D

0x8D5AA8FB
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x2808D326
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0x8CF2D7B6
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x4011697A
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x10D063A0
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xC5285FC4
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0xDE165F2B
shorter.
0x5893ECD2

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0xE2A39C44

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0x1F67C40D
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x3750BBDF
patient downstairs and all."
0xEFBEB0D4

0x8D5AA8FB
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x73320DC0

0x8D5AA8FB
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x517E5F6F
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x461C2E92

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0xF367CED8
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x8323BC25
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0xF0616781
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x2C52A1C8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0xD042191F

0x8D5AA8FB
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xD7BE2DEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x7F598920
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0xE7B2D613
there's no danger."
0x74EB0D5F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0xC9B5992B
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xAAB93470
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x5FA56E6C
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x01247025
here!"
0xCC68D755

0x8D5AA8FB
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0xBA57F98B
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x1C547ECD

0x8D5AA8FB
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x4C7506FC
said Mr. Rochester.
0xB37C52DF

0x8D5AA8FB
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x550A389C
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0xA0D4FA08
looked so quiet at first."
0x52A17B55

0x8D5AA8FB
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0xA9B1B2D4
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0xD84CC866
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x94F76520
alone."
0x75F7D324

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xF1E6CA68

0x8D5AA8FB
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x4DE8D5D7
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x607EA1C0
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0x48C1DC7A
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0x2F6CD4E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0xCFF76547
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x696F312E

0x8D5AA8FB
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x2879F826

0x8D5AA8FB
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x386BD923
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x88B21061
said--
0xE3981FA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x943F5FFC
it."
0xFB910642

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x12C8644C

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x84458A67
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0xE62E6CE7
think of her at all."
0xFF1829F4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xA392C812

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0x58686F1C
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0x300541A6
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x96401234
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xB52A5D6D
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0xA7BFF5C6
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x92D28BD0
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x25879869

0x8D5AA8FB
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0xC530D4D0
and returned with them.
0xB8A537CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0xF882EB54
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0xE8AE88B0

0x8D5AA8FB
I retired as directed.
0x3C716B7B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x210B2807
Rochester presently.
0x2D36438E

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir; all was very still."
0xA8C11540

0x8D5AA8FB
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x085D0F05
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x6110E09A
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x8155DA02
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xA1159286
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x16C8466C
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xBD0B3843
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x98E0363A

0x8D5AA8FB
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0xEB02C44A
edged with fur.
0xAE6DF2C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0x6E52C57D
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x36CB8245
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xAF80B707
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x50FA7B09
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xFA4AF871

0x8D5AA8FB
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0xFD647E25

0x8D5AA8FB
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0xCF9AE48C
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x9B1B9FD8
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x8282DFDD
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0x04BF33E7
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xC649FC95

0x8D5AA8FB
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x896ACF98
the washstand.
0x464FE2F6

0x8D5AA8FB
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0x2975D33F

0x8D5AA8FB
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0xEF2333E4
to Mason.
0xF21EA4BE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0xE95310BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0xDA8D163A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x261553C4

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xEA4B3080
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x1573FD72
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xEBA8218A
liquid; he then took his arm--
0xEF5EF3F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x8B38CE3D

0x8D5AA8FB
The patient rose.
0xF04F0A1D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0xFBAB4BBC
step out--that's it!"
0x15AFB184

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x3A2AD6D2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0x26A0496F
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x09486AFF
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0xDFE21591
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x511428A4
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x38270096

0x8D5AA8FB
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x8E3E30B9
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x18E6B26F
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x4F3F3076
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x84746127
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0xD784811E
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0x36916AB5
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x13918AD5
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x66436E2B
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0x147CDC34
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0xBEB2DBA3
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x560ED233
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0xFF2A68AA

0x8D5AA8FB
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x0F9560C6
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xA95610F8
chaise; Carter followed.
0x25573A53

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0xC999A65B
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0xDEEB845F
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x92BD3F51

0x8D5AA8FB
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0xA8DD7D76

0x8D5AA8FB
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x99175F59
Dick."
0xD40CC838

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fairfax--"
0x5BD9612A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well what is it?"
0x018381BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0xA970A1CB
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xA81AA921

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x2E64CCF0
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x266BB14E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x65B44B70
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0xCD6FE660

0x8D5AA8FB
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xA901B750
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x0707F6A7
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0x6EEBE428
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x6DE1C2FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x58496E74
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x575DACC9

0x8D5AA8FB
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x7A6AC513

0x8D5AA8FB
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0x96A21267
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0xF39FBF1A
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0xB5FC5857
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xE1C5A7CF
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0xEF81B832
pure."
0xDA09DF2F

0x8D5AA8FB
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0xC3DFD86C
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0xC8605830
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0xC925903B
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0xA791D4C9
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x068558A3
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x92304623
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x8A3E4CBB
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0xDA794634

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x97BE5645

0x8D5AA8FB
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0x128513B0
me.
0x75545466

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you, sir."
0x5755F293

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x16CD359D
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x1E50194E
atmosphere?"
0xCBD61EB5

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do, very much."
0xFEDCC710

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x089671DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0xBB7B30D1
with Mason?"
0x9CCCFCC9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x5D66069E

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x75726B89
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0xC16B96FC
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0xEF392B5E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x0D88FB86

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0xB9627F4C
thoughts."
0x92825455

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0xA047F912

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0x70D82312

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0xE193B6C9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xA824F44E
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0xCAB82039
spue fire any day."
0x00509C1C

0x8D5AA8FB
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0x5CA6D0FD
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0xC4E21AC8
you."
0xC2BECC6C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0xC4432C0E
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x52DC4F39
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0xF91BF755

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x67D75EA1
how to avert the danger."
0xDF140218

0x8D5AA8FB
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x6C37F3FE
from him.
0x5907AE1A

0x8D5AA8FB
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0x5623C426
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0xFF908156
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0x6F515143
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0x978C5A06
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0xA8965446
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0x2A1B5A69
friend, are you not?"
0x8F91937F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x72930739

0x8D5AA8FB
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0x2172F2A6
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0x14FE6F30
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0xBEC2FF4E
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0xD036A316
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0xE06E01C5
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x4BEE2732
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xFB8FDC87
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x0DE020A3
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x4A8DA8AA
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x8A1235C5
me at once."
0xFBFD9FEA

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x09E604EF
you are very safe."
0xA8513C4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x50EB7DE1

0x8D5AA8FB
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0xC65CCD83
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0xDD3550BD
before him.
0x5F7F793F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x356CD2D1
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0xA4AF2E69

0x8D5AA8FB
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0xD9D3EF43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0xEA9E12F1
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xFD83BBCD
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x80389189
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x0BC56A7E
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x33CB1D5B
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x860DB9D9

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir; I am content."
0x5B7F1268

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xC98A6E72
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0xC0FF60F0
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x2610541D
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0xEC23DC0C
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0xFA633FA8
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0xD8451F4C
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0x37D60B23
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0xCAD8D012
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xF14B02E8
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0xCCD21703
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x88B6BF69
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0xB44E27CE
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x2AFAE232
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x2331AE42
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x0C482373
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x31096B37
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x46267BC5
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x18FD4E19
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x445CAEF0
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0xC861F837
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x2685BFEF
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0xEDE5C478
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0xB8C7821A
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0x536E9170
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x5E46BE7E
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0xABD9D48E
judgment approves?"
0xE468CC7A

0x8D5AA8FB
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0x8DC803EB
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xB269428E
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x3051D622
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x4165A749
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x20F77555

0x8D5AA8FB
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xBE268DC2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0xCFBE2591
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0xE5B2DCE5
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0xA403CB66
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xCDD2EA3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x263801CA
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x29CCC67C
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x75D599B9
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x60EAC929
amend and solace to heal."
0x55E2C49D

0x8D5AA8FB
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x4A345D6F
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x46AC7C45
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x9E2BCBD9
instrument for my cure in--"
0xA7A5C408

0x8D5AA8FB
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xCC81A44B
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x713BB0B6
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x93DAF6A1
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0xAD5C5CB3
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0xCB315194

0x8D5AA8FB
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x6FCF3059
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0xD96E4492
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x3618B9DD
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xFE128A3B

0x8D5AA8FB
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x92649411
came back he was humming a tune.
0xA47EA469

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0xDA7A41B4
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x08DC8CF9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0xB78B7EAA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0xDEABD2F1
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xF486EC82
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x67310789

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0xFB418FAF

0x8D5AA8FB
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0xB65AAC6A
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x259FD4AE
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0x031734BD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x28715F2E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0xF271697B
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0xC5214A1F
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0xFE7F9AA7

0x8D5AA8FB
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0xFAAB6ED0
cheerfully--
0xED79D9DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0x060C099D
I rose at four to see him off."
0x7C7E7D9D

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXI
0x095BBAC5

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x4E737DFD
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x0F0B7713
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x040E078D
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x73DD35CB
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0xDE214780
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x2754EB95
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x630B3D0A
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0xE0E06338
man.
0x261E7502

0x8D5AA8FB
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0xF5563496
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x5F36E54F
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0xE166EA03
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0xBD21B7B1
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0xB63D64B3
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x782B5319
little sister.
0x54B3675E

0x8D5AA8FB
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xE3A8310A
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xBCEEDDA5
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0xF7F74D81
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0x0E023324
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x0F5BF69E
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x46B0412B
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x7135BB55
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x8B5AC590
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0xB5127861

0x8D5AA8FB
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0xA86D5377
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x2266CC74
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x8E7EA8FA
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x8FB2EB25
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0x8C96D5FD
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xEC894CF4
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0x4EE24031
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x6DA98C8B
was surrounded with a crape band.
0xA81B2640

0x8D5AA8FB
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xDD7F81C9
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x10DD4751
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0x98306016

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x2A0E4F31
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x479BE2FC
are married to Bessie?"
0xFC0A6FC6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0x3B5181BB
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x9B83C31F
child are thriving."
0x8CD81D4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0xAD1C3124

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x19F7F010
badly at present--in great trouble."
0x73749299

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x71D3BB07
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x97FC4343

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0x2A49FD32

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. John?"
0xEC148767

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0xDB436BDF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0xE43CC329
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x67BD382F
his death was shocking."
0xD4539FAA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x865ED046

0x8D5AA8FB
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x04A48213
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x25B660E6
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x68B6489E
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0xFD1B6DB8
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x808EA82D
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0x2CE878FF
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x8ECEF1E8
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0xEB536139
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0xB1860381

0x8D5AA8FB
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x491DCE28

0x8D5AA8FB
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x17152657
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0xBBDDC1DC
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x4C4F9FDB
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x41B82B19
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x71E2454C
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x48D7027A
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x7076F974
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0xA17B9867
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0xFF5BC84F
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x62C76A42
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x06F6591D
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x31BCEBC1
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0xBDB91BB0
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0xD3D22EEC
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x738A45B0
morning."
0xF63123E7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xA4E7837C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0xCE52343B
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x8F153B3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x180B4995
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x07A43B28
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xB1D2014F

0x8D5AA8FB
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x2634B208
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x7F9C59F1
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x204779D9
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0xC88C1CE7
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x9706BC54
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x0477268C
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xBC79C298
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xC5162766
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0xB573370D
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x35995781
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0x6B77AA7A
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xBF2044AC
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0x73AB5337
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0x03B3BD7B
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xBB587FD6
lineaments.
0x91E68830

0x8D5AA8FB
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x9CDAC18B
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0xC1817895
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xC55F62F1
cue and followed me from the room.
0xA7D0CC7D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xD0AC5FD4
which he had shut.
0xB36E20C4

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0x4AE92F78

0x8D5AA8FB
"What to do?--where to go?"
0xBC0AE113

0x8D5AA8FB
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0x6935A966

0x8D5AA8FB
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x4517C10A

0x8D5AA8FB
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x458C5EA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0xB8A1A0A8
people to see her that distance?"
0x1F710CB5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0x04EDAB7C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0xB770D7E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is his widow, sir."
0x2AAFAFCA

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x42D8C275

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0xAA6AE908

0x8D5AA8FB
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x95710AD9
had no relations."
0x1827A518

0x8D5AA8FB
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x3AB1F366
off."
0xDDEC121F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?"
0x9052B961

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0xCAC887A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0xD3DF9FB2
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x98877FD7
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0x43BDBA84
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0x8482E2D4
in London."
0x975D5594

0x8D5AA8FB
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x657F3158
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0xB686ACAB
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0x2C383754

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0x89417C35
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0x5EBC6368
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x6644A33B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0x8765EBBB
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0xF9C75C67

0x8D5AA8FB
"How long will you stay?"
0x16DB63D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0x83EB80FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0xB7C41F4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0xDEFA824B

0x8D5AA8FB
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0x4A51A8B9
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0xA60735B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0xDD56343C

0x8D5AA8FB
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x94C25603

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0xC9DA76A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"A person to be trusted?"
0x790A19EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0xABE09B5D

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0xA2B8A7F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x0EB3DF2D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0xD171C82A
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0x3A5D8974
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0xC11C37D4

0x8D5AA8FB
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x508B4FD5
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x5210339D
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0x621E02B0
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0x3463A3AE
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0x34C14528

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0xED034E84

0x8D5AA8FB
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x477AD25C
if recollecting something, he said--
0xB38C23F0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0x63653B53
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0x6172D38E
plenty?"
0xC50C2B34

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0x7603BC60

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0x2F010D21

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0x6F958982
while I have the opportunity."
0xE30B4214

0x8D5AA8FB
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x1EE467E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0xEB34AAEF
married?"
0xF0ED1FF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; what then?"
0xDCBF7552

0x8D5AA8FB
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0xD26AF44C
perceive the necessity of it."
0xC5D9C3FF

0x8D5AA8FB
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x876BBFA2
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0x95D8101E
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0x39F3795E
straight to--the devil?"
0x940D90AD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0xD66B7FE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0xF59206EE
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0xD88E9592

0x8D5AA8FB
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0x5B4B041F
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0xEA8C64CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0x0C71747D
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0x61D94D49

0x8D5AA8FB
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0xA6868EA9
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0xBA9AE24F
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x224356E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0xB916E142
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."

0x8D5AA8FB
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0xF3B75B29
five pounds, Jane."
0xE7B14C64

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0x321D5430

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just let me look at the cash."
0x548BA3A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0xFF196BA5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane!"
0xC3360555

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir?"
0xAF80061B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Promise me one thing."
0xE64C7160

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0xCAA82B8A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0x62AEA29C
find you one in time."
0xE1B1BE28

0x8D5AA8FB
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0xF505782D
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0x8F617146
it."
0xFB910642

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0x897E9E92
then?"
0x9D55E674

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir; early."
0x30B1B07D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0x43BFE25B

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0x5BD35E16

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0xF6AE68B6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I suppose so, sir."
0xE8370188

0x8D5AA8FB
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0x5BB56B62
not quite up to it."
0x7B92E104

0x8D5AA8FB
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0xFA5CAF82

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then say it."
0xABB8A53D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x87AC45CA

0x8D5AA8FB
"What must I say?"
0xF81008A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"The same, if you like, sir."
0x0B927A39

0x8D5AA8FB
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0x0D6399EB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes?"
0xE0D7536C

0x8D5AA8FB
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0x70775DF2
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x38D3AA0D
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0x783FF939
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0x1401B2CB

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0x09AA4C44
as in many."
0xE004C686

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0xF002812B

0x8D5AA8FB
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x1CE8AA41
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xBAEB0541
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0xF51385E3
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x61D262DD

0x8D5AA8FB
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0x0AABA123
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x5089E306
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0x245C3377
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xC6F2008F
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0x8779EC20
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x2DBD09C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0xCAE15D67

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0xE1757A32
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x0EA1060B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0xE3B41E38
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x8A990FAD
will finally recover."
0x8310D82D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0x140093CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0xEF966201
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x12026C6D
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0xAAB57D83
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0xE179047F
and then I will go up with you?"
0x8AF24CAB

0x8D5AA8FB
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0xBE347E34
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0xD78A9B93
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0xA033488D
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0xE52971CC
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x3DE354D1

0x8D5AA8FB
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0x82BA8D04
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0xEF3AF10F
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x3114955E
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x39D9A58A
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xC1C596E4
looks.
0x67020DEA

0x8D5AA8FB
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x6162EEEC
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x4A0DD2F8
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x79C4DF4B
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xCE6ED596
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x2C03F05B
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0xBE85EC36

0x8D5AA8FB
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0x13B37109
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x96D6DDFD
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x86C0EA6F
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x014750D0
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0xC74A42C0
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x56E856A8
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x80F2B3F2

0x8D5AA8FB
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x62629B54
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x2F9E00C9
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x06F9F3A8
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x5726E312
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x62BDF4D3
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0xA38E4B30
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x7EC9BCAA
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x194E09BA
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0xC5ADDB59
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x3288CF67
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xAA33812F
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0x5D6F3FCC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x768091CC
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x36A0E6D8

0x8D5AA8FB
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x6140F1D1
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xBEF79D4E
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x41907401
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x7D206638
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0xD11789C7
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0xE3515AD2
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x16D26BB3
past recognition.
0x569BECDA

0x8D5AA8FB
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xDCCE22E5
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0xC21EFEB4
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xC15011FF
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x109B49C5
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0x30CAC152
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0x5960217A
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0xE9275DCC
colourless visage.
0x549E2A20

0x8D5AA8FB
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x107A8357
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x255977C9
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0x41F8C2E7
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x2DCB6968
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0xEE2F93D5
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x3310A3EA
other's looked puritanical.
0xBE615441

0x8D5AA8FB
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xEF46AABA
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0x9EF7BF2F
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0x279D1FAF
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x7F4065B6
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x30FB61A3

0x8D5AA8FB
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x59A46E61
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0xED5B9907
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x702F7C7A
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xE8926AC9
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0xD0B20EA0
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x76ED4356
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xED543391
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0xCC5D3351
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xBBC87CA1
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x2AE64113
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0x8A07C177
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0x4B32A544
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0x3E7C38C7

0x8D5AA8FB
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x13780F8E
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x1237EB59
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x1A03A81F
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x32D8C88C
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x4AB5A35A
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x02B8F947
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0xB2F4F265
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0xC881C0A5
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x259710CA

0x8D5AA8FB
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0xCF11C7F6
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0xD1AECDB8
liberty.
0x36621567

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x50A702A2
can see her to-night."
0x67724701

0x8D5AA8FB
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0xED4EB665
should be much obliged to you."
0x7667013A

0x8D5AA8FB
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0xD6AB4C02
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x8DEFA7C9
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x4D07F5EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0x56D2E748
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x27BF7327
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0x801A95A9
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0xB0E788C4
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0x40F1FC0B
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0xED1BC3A5
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x9370B173
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x01D08DDC
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x4C0A990D
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x59E3CD1B
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x39F51EB4
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0xA34E2D79
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0xE80C583B
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x0F7454FA
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x66A564F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x70D63452
us see if she will know you."
0x38E9C677

0x8D5AA8FB
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0x4E35D053
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x515E37D3
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x75D81A3A
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0xF97DCF3E
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x16802F82
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x579CE807
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x4F827B75
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x8B3421EE
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x1576D963
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x01AF555A
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xC9C72540

0x8D5AA8FB
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x5AAB0A23
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0xE45EFF2E
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xCBAF1BC5
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x2986DDC3
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x097C9D2F
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0x9ECE8D85
amity.
0x60945157

0x8D5AA8FB
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x82BB861D
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x0F156ED7
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x3A85011B
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0xD8FDF1D2
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0xA58C3F55
she looked at me.
0x6C3F9402

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x2BC36F75

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0x83E99FDA

0x8D5AA8FB
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x9BC09C07
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0x417B3279
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x2D7EDC8B
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x76DE8E08
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x71BF74E4
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x89913032
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x3C795E46
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x0C31BE91
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x19FC8EC1
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0x4BEEE24E
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x4274614F
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0xBE0D73BA

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xB02558D5
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0xEABCB502
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0xAB8848E8
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x4B3234A5
the pillow.
0xE1CFB3B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xCA866C58
till I see how you get on."
0x88F17E89

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0xC5C80016

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xDC10D98E
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x1793DD34
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x6C33FA80
say--let me see--"
0xA7878F0F

0x8D5AA8FB
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0xF505C579
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0xA1D682DE
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0xF889E575
was at once irritated.
0xD0DF322A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0xC5D59978
you Jane Eyre?"
0xB9FA5B6B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x9C4DE0EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0xAC9332C4
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x1AC1744E
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x1ACE1BAE
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xAB2A3BD9
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x23A3DF4D
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0xAA38A211
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0xCC9ACECD
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x0D4F763A
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0xA4D5DEB9

0x8D5AA8FB
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0xAADB64CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0xF01B5F9B
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0xCE65F5DA
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0xFB2DE663
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x923C99F6
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x1FF525B8
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x77DC2C2A
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0xE4439162
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x5F82F986
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0xB74FEFAC
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x8331D888
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x3EEEF435
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x1FECC636
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x7D3CEF92
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x24E5671B
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0x60EB05C9
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0x53CD3C33
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xCB79ECE0
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xB6A5626E
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0xC425EA9B
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x1F551AB9
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x2F3112DB
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x6FBCF699
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0x410603D6
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x44165E18

0x8D5AA8FB
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0xC7935045
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x1402CFC5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x4242C7D6
the morning she is calmer."
0xCA764D74

0x8D5AA8FB
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xDA8CDA24
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0xAFD7F536
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x66F7D2F7
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x9A798A89
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0xB98961A3
had?"
0x57F62234

0x8D5AA8FB
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0xD5C24FB3
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x54CBCD7F
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0x468280AF

0x8D5AA8FB
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0x25C520DA
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0x35CC03A5
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0xE51D2B55
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0xDABD9103
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xCC31CD4C
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xE0B3AC5F
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x8B0F165C
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0xC79FE308
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0x0F0F0E69
for both.
0x19F85E27

0x8D5AA8FB
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0xAF772BA3
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x6A0C3B6B
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0xF306A761
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x36B0B198
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0xEA78AF41
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0xD011C3BD
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x528A5881
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0x33760439

0x8D5AA8FB
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0xA6D1D08B
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0xB3C18B34
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x84A8ADA7
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0xD7418E8B
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x249ACE31
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0xAC95BA4A
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0xB7680F46
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0xF09CCF06
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0x28B0DB67
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x451B7378
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x21A44BDE
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0x7E6EB00F
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xE74D1A31
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x97584F49
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x5F06E184
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0x4C9F0A71
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0xF99D7E7A
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0xFE9B7564
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0xD2A1B43E
and content.
0xDCE4EF89

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x2DEA707B
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0xD965B00E
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x438EFD84
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0xFAE0212E
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x76EF8DBB
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x4DC56567
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x6950C6E2
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xDD05691C
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x73C39060
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0xE623913B
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x299C34E1
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xB141B867
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0xA7DDDC28
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x0E4158A0
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0x9EBB08AE
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x4D6210A5
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0xBC33BBDE
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0x50903677
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x5EC3098B
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x8F781344
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0xBD36D826
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0xEA4BAFE6
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0x1A5DEEDC
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0xEF160A56
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x30E2EA19

0x8D5AA8FB
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x7DCEAD20
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x0A039180
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xEE7414E5
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x45780087
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xA6E44D1E
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x754671F6
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0xE1D2E4D4
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0xA94A4D39
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0xBF1DA10C
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x9A7F4CA6
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0xD955E270
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0xCCC1D15C
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x28A57BC4
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x64AD05D5
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x68FAAC1D
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x1811298F
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x6340062F
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x67CA901C

0x8D5AA8FB
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x2F888BEE
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0xBE6D63F0
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0xAF0EF713
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x70B218B5
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x2ECAD98A
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x03A9C2FF
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x193B5332
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0xE50DF0A2
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x3BAB8F0B
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x064C45AE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0xA11863E8
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0xF5709931
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x74D66DE4

0x8D5AA8FB
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x51601514
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xE6D8DB89
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0xA149A2E5
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0xDF22A8CE
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x8653DF88
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xC0FE1C40
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0x726E5181
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x3CC00617
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0xA7E3DF88
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x02C4B4A2
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x184F74AA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x5CEC2E71
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x14672674
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x9CD619D2
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x59F66340
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0xE2058178
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x4687F005
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x765AB3EE
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x3EE7F39A
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0xD819345E
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x63B72EDB
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0x8009E943
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x0043C493
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x0C6B606B
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0xD666999F
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0xD501DC51
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x240BE203
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x82044367
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x5B3FBFEC
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x6E209217
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x770039D1
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0xF46B84E3
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0xFD014EFE
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0xE43D224C
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0xC70A2143
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x488915C3
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0x573934C0
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x012B0EAA
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x75ABC5F9
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xBC3B6B61
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0xAED574C9
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0xD5EF391D
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x5D784729

0x8D5AA8FB
She closed her lips.
0xC5164BA9

0x8D5AA8FB
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0xA7466B46
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0x098388E7
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x1910FB37
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0x93C8D4D5
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x9DBEDA96
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x0A90CBB5
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x24E127F9
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x47EDB92B
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0x0E07FC26

0x8D5AA8FB
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0xD8972728
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x75560414
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0x4414171B
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0xBB994896
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x3951750C

0x8D5AA8FB
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x0D6B5828
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x63EBA16F
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0xFF34A53B
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0xEF42BC49
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x9535C2EA
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x0BA8E01C

0x8D5AA8FB
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x991F1BB1
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0x54B51993
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x9F688E34
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x7A428A8D
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x010A911D
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x09F2662F
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x92101DE4
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x259D612C
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x9E09FA95
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0xB3B2C798

0x8D5AA8FB
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0xA227A77E
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0xD6E3F051
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0xE8BB1C15
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x4788DFFC

0x8D5AA8FB
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x6F5A03FD
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xD683A188
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0xCB284DD1
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x3E9D1571
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x34A3E0F9
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x7C28A715
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x0474D60D

0x8D5AA8FB
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x37257339
her.
0xA55BE341

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x938FABDB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0xD876776A
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x543BE1A0
me--where is Bessie?"
0xADA29542

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x20BC1A05

0x8D5AA8FB
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xB643A5C4
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x3B0B44B9
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0xE343F54E

0x8D5AA8FB
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0x772AE850
identity.
0x20E69BA6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0xC56F2B04
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x82FC858A
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0xC8CE51A4
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x922EBA5B
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0xC8E0F39E
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0x73E51286

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x17573A09
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0x2A1C11E1
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x4C1EC618
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0xC2889E84
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x9C8595DF

0x8D5AA8FB
I assured her we were alone.
0xA2D30FBB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xF1BE128B
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0xAD9821EC
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0xC7A0433D
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x0B02B817
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x79EDB550

0x8D5AA8FB
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0x6B3D6024
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x03BC2FE4
of the last pang.
0xEFE1316F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x63D6B1BF
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x61BCFAFA
there."
0x62E72D52

0x8D5AA8FB
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0xA7AE2E28

0x8D5AA8FB
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xF0278E9A

0x8D5AA8FB
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0xB16624E2
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x50E4B8ED
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0x3320FDB8
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0xAB5D85E2
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x3D406009
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x4FA01F1C

0x8D5AA8FB
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x329B1A03

0x8D5AA8FB
It was dated three years back.
0xD913B8C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x08683C22

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x9A54181B
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x462418DF
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0xB73141AA
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x87C4228D
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0xB2A9414B
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0xB9198FFA
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0xB237082C
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0xFE2AFF95
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0x02BDCC62
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0xB96A0DFB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0xE9A49489
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x6EED7214
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0xD22D1BF6
passed since that day."
0x99020DEE

0x8D5AA8FB
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0xE503C80A
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0xCB35D2D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x78C75DCA
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x66069334
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x0B15FB6F
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x54C4B88A
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0xA464C490
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0xF705AE72
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0x8C91A876
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x78F67ED3

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0x8AF1C6DA
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0x4A691576

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0x14B45E3F
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xEE79C192
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0xED59D224
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x8A37E150

0x8D5AA8FB
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x31A248D0
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x37305F32
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0x3713AECA
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x70563451

0x8D5AA8FB
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0xC1ECCF62
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x73D0B3D6
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0xF26D1608
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x0DEA0221
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x0758D309

0x8D5AA8FB
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x766734DF
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x857D3B37

0x8D5AA8FB
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0xE6FF2701
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0xD85F7C1C
she must hate me still.
0xF61CCA43

0x8D5AA8FB
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x5DBF3E87
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xFB07D9B4
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0x630287FE
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0xFA79783B
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0x28CC573E
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0x126D5C40
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x1E259320
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xEC21B728
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0x256485D7
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x76E70BD7
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xA9F3CE78
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0xF8F0C7E1
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x1EE7DD1C
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x336FF6BE
form.
0xD19E88D2

0x8D5AA8FB
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x0003B543
observed--
0xA7C6E801

0x8D5AA8FB
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x9E24FA37
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x96AAE9C4
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x24640039
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0xA341F3C0

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0xA94C37AD
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x2F1CF35B
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0xE21CE58C
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x978D8BB3
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x7638FDA6
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x627CA5CD
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0xFD7D8DEA
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x160B8408
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x8F70495A
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x92A0AF08
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0xADD7630B
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x18DC1D5F
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0xD3D2803F
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x95CD468B
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0xD8B378C4
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0xD31B998B
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xD281B904
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0xCBFDA47E
patient and compliant on my part."
0xC1AD1CE4

0x8D5AA8FB
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x1155EE73
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0xE4E6AB4E
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0xEEB08404
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x77F9D502
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0xA0859776
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0xFA54AEAB
notes of condolence.
0xEE8540E7

0x8D5AA8FB
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0x54E532B6
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x2D6D5AA1
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xD9D5BF59
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0xA51EF123
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0xD68BCC3E
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x84447ED4
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x41E66537
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x480AD9AC
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x52931F6B
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xDC5EBBD9
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x705809D8
veil."
0x99783523

0x8D5AA8FB
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x1B05679F
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x6E98A679
good may it do you!"
0x8CBB499A

0x8D5AA8FB
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x7FD80F4F
you have some sense."
0x6600EC49

0x8D5AA8FB
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0xF3580C22
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x0CC449BC
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xD77E655B
much care."
0xCB9D2EF4

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0xABD3B4D3
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x20ED9C70
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xD5F5606B
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x3F73661E
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x6BFB3072
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x4ADD19DA
fortune.
0xB305721F

0x8D5AA8FB
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x9DA85A0F
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0xEB72395D
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x9CF10E33
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x415A52CC
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0xC02D34FF
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0xA669FDD9
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0xB6BB39C9
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0xF32DF86C
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0xACF1DCDC

0x8D5AA8FB
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0xDFB85602
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x76EDC075
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x7B689FD3
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0x36616AFC
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x41030CD8
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x8B1AA0B0
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x54BA2EAE
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0xF0718408
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0xBF62F62F
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x4839FA94
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xED868AD0
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x19AADB19

0x8D5AA8FB
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0x8E76654B
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x13B73B45
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0x052D61A2
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x1CCA9D30
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0xB33E1CAE
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x2B9C46BD
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0x41072865
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0xD86BE5A7
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x794BF16D
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0xD54F2B2D
don't doubt it."
0x26C72202

0x8D5AA8FB
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0xA237B459
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0x276DF2F0
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xA1EEF2ED
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0x98285D3D
both her and me.
0x49F9E319

0x8D5AA8FB
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xF1DA511C
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x27F78F2F
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0xB8028C5C
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0xD3662AF3
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x43ECCA5C
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x54373324

0x8D5AA8FB
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0x2F33F556
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x4E69BBED
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0xB8C3E595
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x3EDFF9AC
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x404309E2
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x94AEE900
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0x820DC676

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0xF5150CB8
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0xB738F983
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x37C16698
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xE64F7075
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0x34C6BCBA
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x9A2583F0
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x01F0ED28

0x8D5AA8FB
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x448B435A
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0xB456F9B4
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xC4AEFC57
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0xFBF58CA8
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0x56A35459
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x3BB52CD4
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xCD513780

0x8D5AA8FB
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x6EBFB934
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0x90831AFC
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0xA6096221
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0xB3099B1C
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x4B69CB23
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xD6778695
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x24FAA666
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0xEC7AAF4B

0x8D5AA8FB
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x4CDE205D
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x3293D4E3
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x92F6A5BC
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0xADA253EE
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0x07950245
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0xF9DEBB49

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x4A7813DD
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xD8FB2AB4

0x8D5AA8FB
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x3D9A2969
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x65F40AE2
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0x1E9214BF
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x14C6153B
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x7F4043BC
behave with decent composure.
0xDC2993C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0xBACE0A0F
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x6F044AFE
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x5EEEBB90
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0xCB7ECA4B
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0xD49048C2
month?"
0xEAA83BB1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0xCC07D1C5

0x8D5AA8FB
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0x98487132
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0xE1C54F73
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x2957AB61
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x2EFBE372
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0xBDB8CE14
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x2F6BFCBA
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0xC726334F

0x8D5AA8FB
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x9282228D
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x1C334E73
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x16A308FF
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x9869E307
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x1CDDF216
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x2C7F0228
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0x760B010C
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0xD679C520
that it were my home!
0x8BE41DEC

0x8D5AA8FB
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0xEAEF5255
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xACAA2A28

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0x6BBD8E59

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0xFB800518

0x8D5AA8FB
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xAA7A6103

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x626FCECA

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x3D8C7795
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x2471F924
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0xFDB60752
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xBCF30049
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0xDF2E6581
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x42962B98

0x8D5AA8FB
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0xDC4BA1CE
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x8D58CD29
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x03081132

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x13AAECE2
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x5AC9C5E1
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x62D3DAB3
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x18870880
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0xC6894D71
shed it over me now.
0xD5E78318

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0x6B2EBA80
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x6DB0C3AA

0x8D5AA8FB
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x90A5FDD8
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0xB713E455
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x04FAAC66
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0x45584B0F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0xEE1BE101
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0x1D80ABAA

0x8D5AA8FB
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0xC89BCCA3
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0xBAB04915
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0xC67ED51D
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x62CD6843
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xE6A94076
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x14373579

0x8D5AA8FB
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x6B7ACEC6
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0xAD5032EA
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0xA2BD9A50
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xF5576DCF
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x369789BC
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0xF2920A3C
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x7363FA72
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x3B2F366C
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0xFE27028C
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x1C523604
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x55AC1629
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x4B874AB3
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x91286128
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x344CC07C

0x8D5AA8FB
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x918343B5
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x314D3D9E
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xF6D6E32B
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x699470A3
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0xD506067C
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0x5389297D
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xC999C239

0x8D5AA8FB
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0xCBF57833
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0xFBDD54B7
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0x7416C1E5
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0xFA4B927A
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0xA34F5A66
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0x741B7831
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x64BB3C17
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x3CC019D2
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x43C7668F
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0xD014436C
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0x01AA820B
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xB2CF749F
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

CHAPTER XXIII
0x19328BD5

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x7BFA2696
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x1BA0DCBD
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0xBBCE2AA7
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x86111812
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0xA5983F75
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0xB131A708
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x9EE1638A
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x42A60915

0x8D5AA8FB
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x5B6A3B25
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0x5941B04C
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0x50E2D8A1

0x8D5AA8FB
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x352FA68B
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x6D9CCB7B
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0xB7A2EFB1
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x6D1FBC7D
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0xBC27F01E
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0xBAC0C88A
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xD264364D
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0x84BA51FA

0x8D5AA8FB
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x499D6C21
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0xF765DC66
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0xD1F5DB97
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x64477370
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x8F054AF0
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x3BF90EB2
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x78F02C8E
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x54979BED
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0x87CAC0F5
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x1AE11B34
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x3D42D9CB
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0xFDDE246F
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xF4164F58
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0xD7E86457
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0xA9BCFA50

0x8D5AA8FB
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x866178DD
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x7014D674
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0x2840A896
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x939AB097
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x9DC16AB6
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x06AE2111
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0xDC07AAE0
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0xD9131BDF
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x5657D12A

0x8D5AA8FB
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x3740015D
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xE10D478B
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x702A0945
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0x3BB8FFB8
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0x7C7DCF71
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x4F170D87
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xE2831CFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0xCD0A0A3F
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x2365157A

0x8D5AA8FB
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0x08770EBA
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xF9510EEE
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x94CE3641
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0xE3B94D57
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x96A8E540
turning--
0xE852494A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x8678CFF5

0x8D5AA8FB
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0xCA0AFFEA
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x254B9204

0x8D5AA8FB
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x2DA9B44F
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xABAA45F7
there! he is flown."
0x067697DD

0x8D5AA8FB
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x5FBF182B
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x4FE5CE22

0x8D5AA8FB
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0xA25EA931
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x56059397
moonrise."
0xBACE6468

0x8D5AA8FB
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xF81893C1
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x19C4A8DC
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x843559BF
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x6663385E
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0x6B81ED9D
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x3905A10D
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x143FDDEB
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x42EA38D3
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x5918FD67
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x537AF53C
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x63B92D62

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0xF5E01314
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x7405B98A
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x38DE3D8C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0x610441DF
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xEB50E705
Adhesiveness?"
0x3FD77B92

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x14C5B308

0x8D5AA8FB
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x47C1FE89
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0xD09DC5BC
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x140E1109

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x37391E9F

0x8D5AA8FB
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0xFB7771E0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0x2A831A0C
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x72D09BFB
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x7E5A382D
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x9F61DE84

0x8D5AA8FB
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0xDB821B8B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0xBC06D2F6
must."
0x7C8AAF3E

0x8D5AA8FB
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0x91232BD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0xF1E9D8A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0x62B04E53

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0xC0D8F6AA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0xC5112728
straight on the head."
0x02458887

0x8D5AA8FB
"Soon, sir?"
0xBE4D000D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0xAAC4A723
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xC41796B7
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x2D1DD4E5
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x745521F4
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0xD3954F9D
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x50226447
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x3F772359
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x60C6E6A5
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x07070D05
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x3C515F4A
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xAB76877F
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0xE934C58E
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0xC9F916F7
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0xA47B370F
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x47FB6D88
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0xF86EFA82
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0xFA3842E8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0x08E7CB57
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x8F7B1C22
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0xB2B3E09E
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0xB524D43E

0x8D5AA8FB
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0x63C7C405
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x21E40EE1
for you."
0x190E8F28

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0xCD6C4481

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0x247533A7
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x84CF3D94
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x86722AA6
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x9B1B7782
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x18CE9C5A
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0xBC7CA46B
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0xCE9D4B11

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x955677E5

0x8D5AA8FB
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0x18AF73EE
distance."
0x799CBC6A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x9C629BE3

0x8D5AA8FB
"From what, Jane?"
0x6C64867E

0x8D5AA8FB
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0x041DB13A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well?"
0x2FADD6BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"From _you_, sir."
0xB23B6EAC

0x8D5AA8FB
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x194D5FE0
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0x92F98E78
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x9BFBA092
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0xBCC30EE9
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0xA7B16D80
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0x14321A01
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xE13FD95B
loved.
0x6229C033

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xD22E2E88

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x2E41F5B0
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0xA432223C
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0xE291D5C8
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x95A42977

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xC75DB01B
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0xEDB656C7
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x74B7C939
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0xB6B44E47
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0x27511CD9
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x6EFACDC7
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x6DF8E54A

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x6D14ECF9
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x7D8B0E2A
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x125B007C

0x8D5AA8FB
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x6CBA7D28

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x6044261C
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x0F40E64D
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xB3AF8461
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x70DC0C6E
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0x438855A1
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x3F15F732
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x7ED9E5FB
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x84526DF8

0x8D5AA8FB
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x6F651FED

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0xD6A93F34

0x8D5AA8FB
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x19CC4F6A
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0xDEF01AF9
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x9EA77FA0
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xC91D76BD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0xBE14F3A7

0x8D5AA8FB
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0xC55E82A5
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x5EE60215
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0xC036AE72
speak.
0xA6956F63

0x8D5AA8FB
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x6EC7467C
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0xD6486C2D
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x76DE91E9
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x03AA29CC
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0x8AC0B7D2
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0xE83B6E75
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0xF32B39E9
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0x0E2F7856
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0xD9BC1DDA
on the necessity of death."
0x4C8F5B6B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x6A56BD9B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0xC379DF4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"In what shape?"
0x8383A518

0x8D5AA8FB
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x0F8E9771

0x8D5AA8FB
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0xE733C722

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you will have."
0xE7176686

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x41BB087D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x0BFF93F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xA9D9D4DF

0x8D5AA8FB
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x3E53EF58
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xF8DB6F18
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x92A6699C
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x0D5FF1FB
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0xE695EFFB
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x65526F29
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x4B4CBCB7
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0x9329F2B0
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x7FDA8E6B
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0xEEE8BCA9
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x1EF88CC1
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x7DEF7B9C

0x8D5AA8FB
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0xB361EC3C
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x4F8A05C5
Jane!"
0x14C88B1F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0xA5561EC0
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xBC60B073
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x837003DD
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x2813C3F7
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x74949282

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x1B2267EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0xE349774A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0xCD49B5F9
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x0070DC8B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x6610D412
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xEAE24815

0x8D5AA8FB
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x9DF43BF1

0x8D5AA8FB
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x9AF2D135
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0xB3D3415C

0x8D5AA8FB
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0xF5718FE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x93D01A5C
best earthly companion."
0xFA464685

0x8D5AA8FB
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0xFC91AE54

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xEE7C080C
too."
0x1AC80422

0x8D5AA8FB
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x58F3ADCC
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x91642C6E
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0xAA41B1AA
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xFD1284D7
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x5569448E
said--
0xE3981FA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0x09240E8E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0x9F1C64A5
return."
0xF0824CA7

0x8D5AA8FB
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x6C4AD085

0x8D5AA8FB
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0xE4708CF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0xA8DB8736

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your bride stands between us."
0x53DC8D5D

0x8D5AA8FB
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x50CEB26A

0x8D5AA8FB
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0x34305368
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x02C6544E

0x8D5AA8FB
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x5F89A379
was still incredulous.
0x72622A7B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x62775351

0x8D5AA8FB
"Entirely."
0xB3C5C980

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have no faith in me?"
0x61E0F4D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not a whit."
0xB34F774F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0x96EBD811
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x0B7E08F3
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0xD3AC4714
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x5CFA3293
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x11B14494
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0xEF90B565
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0x88E8B9BA
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0xDDD629B5
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x181B01B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x19B2C110
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x3BEF0D90
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0xF4B137BC
given me?"
0x006FBC49

0x8D5AA8FB
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x80D679BC
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x701AE1D5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x4DF8DC16

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?"
0x9052B961

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x5F2D40FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x73CC3377
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x9E7C25B3

0x8D5AA8FB
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0xBADE6EDE
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x21E36B61

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0xD605A546
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0x24377B19

0x8D5AA8FB
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x083E05DA
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x45165D72

0x8D5AA8FB
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xF2AAF312
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x30031945

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x11EF67CC
be your wife?"
0x6A2295A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x41D49FC4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xF935DD29

0x8D5AA8FB
"Edward--my little wife!"
0x97D15E04

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dear Edward!"
0x27C58BF9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0xAC1745F9
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x159CFCA8
happiness--I will make yours."
0xD298B615

0x8D5AA8FB
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x2A1D15BC
have her, and will hold her."
0xD946D592

0x8D5AA8FB
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0x269251EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xBB882FEF
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0xCDCC71C7
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0xAA99CB59
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x7561CA08
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0xC14F661B
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0xC3E14598
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0x54280450
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x22786AB8
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xE7EB6F70
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0xC6E9C6F6
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x0F35C212

0x8D5AA8FB
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x21CEAF4F
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x786DA49B
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x6D56E12C
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x6ADBBA8D

0x8D5AA8FB
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0xF2478E70
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x487AE2AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x26E14291
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0xD0BB2D3E
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0x8243AA7F
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x8A46FD4E

0x8D5AA8FB
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0x13C11DC8
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xC2FBE42D
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x548FCD63
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x58DA3116
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x9D67C3F8
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xEE06E162

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x680DEBE0
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x12396B8E

0x8D5AA8FB
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x089AB6DE
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x85225C76
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0xCB9E9AA2
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0xB5F45FCC
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0x907435CC
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0xBFC09A58
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0x67C5AAF1
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x6BCC34FF
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0xE9B868AF
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x7B7B8002
strength for anything.
0x863BE48D

0x8D5AA8FB
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x31CDCFE5
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x98156456
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0x78CA7EB5

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXIV
0x71A1E087

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x80D27E78
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xEEFC9823
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x6C36E47D

0x8D5AA8FB
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0xA02995E9
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x60430389
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x52634AFB
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xDAD8D782
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x0BC90A99
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x48C48666
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0xDBEA4B87
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0xADC63BD0
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0x47FF1AA0

0x8D5AA8FB
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x88401612
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x0BAC6E92
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x5E85429C
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x93C07B47
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x4D1929A5
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0x26B75B6C
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x591E58E7
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0x68978C60
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x68A3CD13

0x8D5AA8FB
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x3D375206
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0xF70385F1
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0xE0D95B65
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0xB4AE57E2
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x22464953
schoolroom.
0xE4841494

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x5F5E5C6D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x0693381F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where is he?"
0x77055FB4

0x8D5AA8FB
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x5B215816
there he stood.
0xB470B756

0x8D5AA8FB
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0x384800B4
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0xCE904ED9
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x154934E9
well loved, so caressed by him.
0xF0B23407

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x2D21030A
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x0687BE6A
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x4A15AE00
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xA9ACA0BE
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x112CEC5F
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x3FFA5AE0

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x76E01638

0x8D5AA8FB
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x92D10641
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x508644B4

0x8D5AA8FB
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0xC538D71B
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x8C3FA7C8
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0x611EF14C
think almost fear.
0xE14B64C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x4F1E1C0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x3FBEBED7
strange."
0x0EC47CA1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0xA8DC1F83
Rochester's girl-bride."
0x6693468A

0x8D5AA8FB
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xEFF61377
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0xF233B070
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x1C03170B
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x4C1849FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0x24A12CD8
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x877128AC
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0x13EB992F
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0xFB6B0A21
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0x81CE0616

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x3FBA0285
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x95259F28
have them."
0x269BDF58

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0x23A5CA67
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0xA648EA80
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0xC79C55CF
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0xB56705B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0xCE9807AB
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0x7FCFE695
Quakerish governess."
0xB8165A2B

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xDF52CB90
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x2099E407

0x8D5AA8FB
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0xE367B140
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0xDC9B9BEA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0xA8C8122B
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x4350DF46
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0x72AD103C
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x4C4E6FBE
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0xC7234D4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x468A7B70
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x44E4AF69
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x60EBCAE6
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x8F27E77F
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0xBC87AE04
flatter me."
0x59BEFA63

0x8D5AA8FB
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x7E053BF6
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0xA1F8AF7A
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0xFF267AD0
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x6A039630
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0xF99B4010
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xA2E75479
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0xD54BAEC8
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x6B69CFE3
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x23494CBB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x6E7D419B

0x8D5AA8FB
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0x5AD56D6E
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x0F183995
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0xD02F5F06
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x4BF88983
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x8EC1AB5D
as my comforter."
0xB04BA4DE

0x8D5AA8FB
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xE3B1290F
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xA221EEDA
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x66E58A4F
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0xE0246CDA
anticipate."
0xCAF6F58A

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x3066CF94

0x8D5AA8FB
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x9E138936
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x15969B76
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x6586067E
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x6F07091F
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0xC14AA817
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x9618D25D
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0xF1D19EAA
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0xB4910E02
dear master."
0xC9291D86

0x8D5AA8FB
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0xF31E30B2
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x6BBE3491
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0xBFAA72BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0x1B6052E0

0x8D5AA8FB
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x6566B4D1
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0x6615B6B2
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x15D85D5A
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x797E2361
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x98FD7DE5
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0xF3E15A2C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0x1AB10CFD
such an one?"
0x7EF266BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I love it now."
0xFF715F55

0x8D5AA8FB
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x2D39CF54
standard?"
0x346CA9D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0xF6065431
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0xCF82EF03
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x687680DB
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x5A79BE60
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0xF31C637E
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x8C9F5F9F
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0x8CD0BFEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0x01B10071
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x655E0846

0x8D5AA8FB
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xCE6C62EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0xDF8E9AED
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0xAD9A1821
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x72D5C3DC
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0xA410675E
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x6FCB7047
pleasure to grant."
0xBB02B7FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x3CC7E79C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0x9CEB7A8E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x9D1D3CF3
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0xB47BA4BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x89974339
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x05265B59
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x84D231CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0x568860BC
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x2A016B58
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0x59EFB098
withdrawn: try again."
0xAB6A4489

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x166FAE83
piqued on one point."
0x28769958

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x4CD809D2
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0x63317908
request--"
0xDB39FF71

0x8D5AA8FB
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0x219EEF14

0x8D5AA8FB
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0x9DEDA796
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0xFBB69E11

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0x82D1D905
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x167E2707
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0x3C79618E
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0x42D40C11

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x689E11A1
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0xEAEE68C7
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x63DFFDF9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0xA63B02CD
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0x37643A7D
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x1FAE7A34
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0x77958C6C
of my power?"
0xC49BA5A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0xEA66F94D
up."
0x8BB9DCE0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0x67E3D919
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0xCA8E3D09
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0x994F251E
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x3AB03D4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x1AC6DD04
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x1CB496C2
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x0720E4EE

0x8D5AA8FB
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xC36AE7C5
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x7FDCA5A8
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xB1B98A7D
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x6DEC576B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x4F32AA09
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x742433FD
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0xA21A5CE7
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x1B61C3F2
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x9BCBA6E5
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0xE016F9E2
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x1225A25C
made me the offer."
0x1FDF357A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0xE0B0A44F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x7D36C232
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0xA6825D0B
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0x65413393

0x8D5AA8FB
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0xD25BCC9C
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x869BCA05
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0xF8489BC5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0x5C5A6C5F
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x70CBD2B2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0xAEFFC383
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x6A75A28A
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x343DCC6A
deserted?"
0x6A89DC75

0x8D5AA8FB
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x38565D5F
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x3DC44718
moment."
0x24BBD521

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0xF8A11913
principles on some points are eccentric."
0xF3E66E79

0x8D5AA8FB
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0xEF5E31EA
awry for want of attention."
0x25F62D9D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x40251701
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x6F8E755A
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x9F21B58E

0x8D5AA8FB
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0xCABAAC9F
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x85B1EC28
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0x77C67617

0x8D5AA8FB
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x98F295F7
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x92507549
express.
0x2103A7AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x51AE151D
entreated, and to yield."
0xA5FAECDF

0x8D5AA8FB
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0xF7A61DA2
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x31547188
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x55192718
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x21410E79

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x47FE32EF
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x87F72319
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x2AB19CE2
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x9F21DEFA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0x4B218AF9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0xC0EFA72B
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xD75E9780

0x8D5AA8FB
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0xF71DB93C
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xFD866671
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x1D1E4BDB
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0xED935776
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x569F53BD
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x32E2AE84
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x0F82F554
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x60445852
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x793438C2
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0x533E49B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0xEEA4F4EA
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0xE2738422
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0xCD267B9B
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x95D28976
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x521AE98B
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xE45E62C3
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xBFEA0EA1
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x1D772E01
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x7CA6C199
you would be his wife."
0x2C5CE911

0x8D5AA8FB
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x43063B3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0xF1F5AF4B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0xD6FCBF1D
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0xD72BB85A
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0xD2E8776A

0x8D5AA8FB
"He tells me so."
0xC7C83AE2

0x8D5AA8FB
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x23EA4D8B
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x971AAFFA

0x8D5AA8FB
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x73E2C637
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x4F81EAA0
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0xB5B0B8AB
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x5E144D9F
father."
0x4EDDEC0C

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x87ADD0ED
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0xC4937C4D
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x8B10375D
twenty."
0x1A69AF3F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x758DB47A

0x8D5AA8FB
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0xA034B711
eyes.
0x8B840583

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0xE8A8094B
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0xD855FF92
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0xE29DBDAC
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0xE8F160BA
I expect."
0xDFA0DD6E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0xC90B1A10
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x2BFA648A

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0xB5B5C63C
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0xF260A580
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xDFC3A3DA
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x3DB19571
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x89748AA3
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0xB1D21E0B
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0xB4102524
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0xF29BD3AD
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0xF7CE4A59
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0xB6A7C60F
him."
0xA6DBC707

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x9953258B
that all was right."
0x86E6B5A9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xB4160AF2
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x7BB30DDD
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xC7D2A92D
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0xD6078A0F

0x8D5AA8FB
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0xF5EDC8D1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x564890B3
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xBEF3A0D4
me go mademoiselle."
0x956B128E

0x8D5AA8FB
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x32FC7405
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x00A0386E
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0x269209BE
backwards and forwards.
0x18DC8607

0x8D5AA8FB
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x17B9EE4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0xCA70CE03

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x3F29375E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x90BCAC83

0x8D5AA8FB
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x86F0974C
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x7D70004D
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x2B8E1FE0
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x87085DFA
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0xD30E9F67
my face.
0x44AE20DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0xAEB81BD0
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xA1EDB7ED

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x652D9918

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0xEAA1E143
to Adele.
0x4611450F

0x8D5AA8FB
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x8CAC1062

0x8D5AA8FB
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0xFF362B3B
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0xF3EF701D
company--for life."
0xF5AC66A2

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0x12DA81EB
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0xBB0D26CE
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x0D38D46D
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x4EDEC7CB
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0xB6AD8EAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x252E0027
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x9D4F5727

0x8D5AA8FB
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0xBB910FA6
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0x8F5B733B

0x8D5AA8FB
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x0948D0AB
mademoiselle?"
0x5E56BEA1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0x5F1AD5B8
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x8D5AFE6F
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x249A7653
there, and only me."
0xDFCC0EE4

0x8D5AA8FB
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xAACD8225

0x8D5AA8FB
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x514BDC18
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x6AD9FD51

0x8D5AA8FB
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0xFF14B7E0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0xE19F5B9E
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0x4510B075

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x4948A85C
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0x3A7274C5

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x10C0DE4E
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x19FC2EE5
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x8DF3E639
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0xB6FE8E79

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0x208141FE
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0x2BBABAA4
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x90C327A0

0x8D5AA8FB
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0xCA9768DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x4705E025
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0xE1E9D0B1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x613CBFA0
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xCEDBFC26
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x03F83313
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x258668D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xCBC97006
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0xB25EFF47
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0xE9601B1D
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x21B82517
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0x70F957C4
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x32E2E395
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0xF336A202
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0x953EA387
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0xD9AD8D4F
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0x81DE724B
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0xEF62578C
effect--
0xAD1DA6ED

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0x1A894F5C
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0x8D4F4897
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0xC0E56752
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x03D6D4D6
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0x3053E4B2
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0xF204BA39

0x8D5AA8FB
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0xA1BEAFE4
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0xD457E84D
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0xAD8E7168
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xC5557E28
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x25C25C47
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x56AD59E2
again."
0x276C0ED5

0x8D5AA8FB
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x2CB79D9B
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x191E3216

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x67DC87A6
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x5944D63D
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x1A22DCD0
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0xFC84F32B
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x0899D5DC
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0xDE6067EF
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x94F6F601

0x8D5AA8FB
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x52C74901
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0xCB777B31
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x46555694
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0xDF522DE7
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x5486F1C2
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0x09A5A21E
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x76548313
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0xF7514C79
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x47926CBA
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x869662E7
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x033A19D4
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0xC28B0809
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0xA4718EF2
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xA3A358C0

0x8D5AA8FB
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0x3C45A3DC
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0xE3A44849
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0x14AF7E4A
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0x34E98E1F
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xA09CE114
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0xA4E0A8A0
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0xFF810EC2
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x629EDA35
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x86FCBCBA
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0xC1473981
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x5BF5BC6E
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x5D19BD83
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x5D4DB765
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x786E8B64
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x175511B2
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0xE122514F
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x84DAB9C2
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x54643B91
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x9055C6D4
passionate pressure.
0x7BD53DE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x9878DF0D
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x3E269758
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0xD65860FF
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x27CC9FFD
satin."
0x29B5D910

0x8D5AA8FB
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x355DD4FD
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0xCBBC2E75
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x8E938505
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x10AD21DD

0x8D5AA8FB
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0x166B27D4
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0xA2A74C7C
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x7B4BBC76
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x2071CEB0
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0xAFF16512
satisfactorily here."
0xE33793E0

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xFCEB09B0
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0xACB1D7C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x31560747
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0x9B0DEEB1
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0x1E0E25C7
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0x89178E8F
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x96A0B2EF
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x8DE8FAC0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0xDE596666

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0x711C4FC9
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x80145EF0
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0xBA6D2E2F
would be to violate its conditions."
0x44CBF1C8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x7A0A7A49
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0x60DEEB71
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0xF160D5B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0x7B370C0F
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0xF2C2E671
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0x3ECA5D3F
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0x0268B996
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0xBC178BE5
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0xA594A100

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, but what?"
0x1E15E32A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0xF93B68E7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0xD2C51B92
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x3A2D9F5C
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0xEDCBA47E

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, thank you, sir."
0xC7375444

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0x79BDD516

0x8D5AA8FB
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0x95371B4C
till--"
0x2C701EAC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0xCBD0ACF0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Till I can't help it."
0xEB149686

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0xC4F2E22E
companion of my repast?"
0x3D5AE0A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0x19FACA49
usual for another month."
0x633249C8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0xFB8ADE80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0xD0694DAB
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x24F4D5E8
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0xD76B49FE
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0xB681CACD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0xE1B5AB42
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0xE80FB9AE
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0x163DCDB6
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0x70474460
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x633C96D2
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x7B19EBA8
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x365F2560
my jewel I should tyne."
0xEC599F49

0x8D5AA8FB
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0xA8CBB164
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x276B4541
retreat upstairs.
0x688ACC8D

0x8D5AA8FB
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x008EF1EA
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0x42B89917
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x3846984C
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x7300DCBA
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x7364AD80
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x726E3CCD
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0xF47E3FDF
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x6B5CCF4A
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0xCEA59432
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0xCD9FC34E
the present.
0x802BB653

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x159859FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x9714FE4B
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0x83CC04E7
stimulate it.
0xBD90ED2F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x9221FF14

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x04225008

0x8D5AA8FB
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x64853B8F
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0xB5805B3C
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x55146214
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x47237931
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0xEA9DA82B
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x63D7CFB8
strain:--
0xB680D3B2

0x8D5AA8FB
   "The truest love that ever heart
0xED83F17F
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x80DF5878
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0x3A99B264
      The tide of being pour.
0xEDDF83EB

0x8D5AA8FB
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x5504E4FD
      Her parting was my pain;
0xDD17A489
   The chance that did her steps delay
0xBAD4B320
      Was ice in every vein.
0xC4B8F254

0x8D5AA8FB
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x8ECBFC9F
      As I loved, loved to be;
0x438EADD4
   And to this object did I press
0x96C8C99C
      As blind as eagerly.
0xE81BC849

0x8D5AA8FB
   But wide as pathless was the space
0x16D3E90D
      That lay our lives between,
0xFEB41C41
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0xC1AC3F8A
      Of ocean-surges green.
0xA1606323

0x8D5AA8FB
   And haunted as a robber-path
0xBE3180BA
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x055336CE
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0xB7B6BEFF
      Between our spirits stood.
0x837385C8

0x8D5AA8FB
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x571C50FB
      I omens did defy:
0x9364E28B
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x834BC70A
      I passed impetuous by.
0x6616825E

0x8D5AA8FB
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0xF4FD9C50
      I flew as in a dream;
0x3DB0CC7D
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0x7CDEFE0A
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0xB582E7D0

0x8D5AA8FB
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0x0913694D
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x1C44D262
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xC2A70D15
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x12B7E155

0x8D5AA8FB
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x8BC70FFE
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x68B15934
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0xE4F3E938
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0x6B686DA1

0x8D5AA8FB
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x9A3832C2
      Right, bar approach to me,
0xD11F5E2F
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0xD6B86D87
      Swear endless enmity.
0xF9863C3B

0x8D5AA8FB
   My love has placed her little hand
0x4CBD8E7E
      With noble faith in mine,
0x3396298E
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x6A3BCAE6
      Our nature shall entwine.
0xFE1D7102

0x8D5AA8FB
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x241188DB
      With me to live--to die;
0x776B7EC2
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xFD56DE9F
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x78916FF2

0x8D5AA8FB
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0x0FD34CCF
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0xA38789BD
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0xD4EFD49E
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0xF87173B0
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x3511CDD6
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xE9771A5D

0x8D5AA8FB
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x56CEC1F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x9524EE19
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0x333B46C6
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0x37ED2E0D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0xC12216E3
Death was not for such as I."
0xC2575C11

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x27D3B766
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x4131A4A9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0xF3B30659
reconciling kiss?"
0xD965F647

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x8FC01767

0x8D5AA8FB
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0xE3BC770B
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x11CAC9C3
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x6CCD594E

0x8D5AA8FB
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x9ABA32DA
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x1172F4A4
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0xBABE647E
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0xCC266780
time to rescind it.
0xBD5B2ECD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x4AE34B69

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0xB5FB01CF
myself I was doing that now."
0xAFCACA60

0x8D5AA8FB
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x2C8F4AED
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0xD32DE477
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x5F12DB5E
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xF63932AC
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0xBCE97A87
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0xED46DF0E
advantage."
0xC0257020

0x8D5AA8FB
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0x676D1944
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x02C95BB4
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x0AC4C0AD
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0xF7545667

0x8D5AA8FB
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0x867A96C9
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xB54678AE
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x61E24B4F
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0xBFF0D6FC
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0xE91A6A7A
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x53FF94A1

0x8D5AA8FB
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xAFF39760
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x11D11703
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0x81F421DA
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x72BC21DD
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0xAB9C5214
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x41F3031B
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x1DE9996C
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0x0C66664B
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0xBDEED5D7
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xA9DCC3BD
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x424B59F7
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0x82AB3F9D
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x70B73BF4
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x18C56F4F
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x47CFED6C
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0xD5947199
virtue, another must be devised."
0xB465A82E

0x8D5AA8FB
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0x2A936D0E
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x3C47DEEA
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0xA72D264B
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x44E8BFF7
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0xE6AF0497
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x4120771D

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x1ECE76AF
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x04341096
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x504BB249
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x23943975
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xFEF73C0E
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x0DB85D54
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0xC3FA3547
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x5491EA5A
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x7F378B48
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x6DFC1D0C
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0xDA5D3804
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x749B0AB2
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x7535963D
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x070BFD28
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x99FB67EB
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xAE3816B1
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x4831898F
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0xEDB0F34D
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x643D124F
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x8067DB8C
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0xA81B0E21
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x25D2D4F6
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0xAE3CFA3F

0x8D5AA8FB
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0x4DE71252
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0xFEB3BBF4
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x0EBFC026
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0xB06FEE14
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x761E6E7A
more than they.
0xD80E25BE

0x8D5AA8FB
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x0CFA3A68
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0xE244EF0C
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0xFD3E506C
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0xFD1E17FC
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0x77936568
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x8BDFB5EA
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x777CFC86
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x9D3AF36D
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0xDE46CCE1
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0x0DF3954C

0x8D5AA8FB
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xCED8FB8C
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x7C7E8BDB
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x66B815A4
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x9DB72CA8
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xA98C0D6C
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x4C467DAA
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x3E8343D0
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0xE53AC451

0x8D5AA8FB
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0xAB4D204C
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0xA303EA2F
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0xF5107B9F
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x2C2AC36D
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0xDA8ADBD4
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0x49E5AA5E
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x5842AABD
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x14098F3A
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0xF1623AF1
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0xB01C9B68

0x8D5AA8FB
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x4794C503
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x9042C2BC
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x61DA1AED
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x3A959F24
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x2E479418
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0xB18EC0D8
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x6D1E6456
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x35155F66
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0xF76058ED
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0x75AB5657
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x2D93B05D
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x6DB74FEC
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x057712B6
listen to, and I ran off again.
0xAF89241D

0x8D5AA8FB
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0xBB1F176C
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x479F5A83
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0xB84E3A68
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0xF2817F16
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0x7A6BDF6E
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0xAFF33982
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x7F28D36A
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0xDD7A2E2C
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0xC26569C2
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x050145BD
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0xCDBB9E68
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x3CE1F56A
simultaneously struck ten.
0xFC828106

0x8D5AA8FB
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x5408E0AC
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0xB878887C
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x253F483B

0x8D5AA8FB
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0x7DC91710
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xFE11C8C8
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0x385257D0
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0xCBD1C358
by one moving speck.
0x4669AD40

0x8D5AA8FB
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0x8B1E7F8A
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xDAD028DE
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x0F457106
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x1DEB8D00

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x133DFE83
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0x2ECB6E95
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x7EC17FC2
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0xCEDBACC0
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x8A0AC972
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0x71032434
meridian, and must now decline.
0xCB7B0144

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x3FCFF17E
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0xEC643EFD
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xD05AF29C

0x8D5AA8FB
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0xA215A942
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xA473BDDD
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0x30046BF4
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x8F7D7D57
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0xDFB4F045
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x7EF29F3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0x66ACF113
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x49A6B582
give me both hands: mount!"
0xB24EC7DB

0x8D5AA8FB
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x15C8851B
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x58884E97
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x9FB763C6
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x35311787
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0x8A9BF686

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0x10476703
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0xA03AE3B1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0x09FDC335
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x58AF31C1
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0xF3A7B069

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xBB0C1E42

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you have been both?"
0xDCAA8E48

0x8D5AA8FB
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0xB2666732
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x8AFE9481

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x3DB704C8
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0x42290521
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0xAC54DED5
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xA7B3099C
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0x96569523
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x09AA17FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0x9576C7AE
get down."
0x2CF1F377

0x8D5AA8FB
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x6617268F
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x2CF2C579
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0x4AF19DE5
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x22EE7BAA
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x685EEA20

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x5D833CC3
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x279CA43B

0x8D5AA8FB
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xC454D27D
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xCCB7C8B8
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xEE2208FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0x9FD8945F
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0xD2E1D213

0x8D5AA8FB
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0xC94D77F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0xFC0B3C1F

0x8D5AA8FB
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0x1194AFD1
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x49BEA310
as a long, strong arm.
0x0F64915F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xDD369ADE
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x5D6D285B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Jane."
0x7E6F9CAE

0x8D5AA8FB
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x0F3E0359
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x34255F90

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x65B47802

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0xC3F46B6D
my wedding."
0xC3D2127B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xF37488DB
no wish to go to bed."
0xE9D8B663

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x3D663CB6

0x8D5AA8FB
"All, sir."
0x4F36EA9A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xFA5681BD
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x6B05D6EC
from church."
0x06506E34

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well, sir."
0x886ECF36

0x8D5AA8FB
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xAC923482
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x43DC7D86
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0xF9737048

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe I am."
0xE724FBB6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x605D226D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0x34451EC5
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xC7E4A642
charged?"
0xE51ED6E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0x8FEB2DC6
over-fatigued."
0x874838BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xDAB0FCD8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x8382FD64

0x8D5AA8FB
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0x6E71F997
and flushed.
0xAE646D3C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0x283024E2
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xF7CB9D58
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0xC4FD592F

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0xF0572CAA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x4D6AAE39
new life into which you are passing?"
0x03BF8AA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0xEC5A7259
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x492BF020

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0xEFEA30D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0xD91CB5C3
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xC58B4991
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0xAEBBADB6
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0x06CBDF85
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0x150496CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x76401F6F
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0xA68AF2A5
proceeded.
0x2FEA5BE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0xF49FBB3F
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x192ACC6D
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0xD77E7E8D
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0x9D8F6B6E
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x39CED787
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x307354F7
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x317D279F
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x48A9747E
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0xF857BFE7
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x7F12EADA
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x63050BC8
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x8306294E
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x36202B32
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xA4E8A6D9
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x0531E76E
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0xED65D367
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0xB2B47542
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x486AEA77
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x141EF887
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x2081C2D0
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x52DA547C
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0xC35E5F69
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0xA3285E57
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0xB9A22859
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x084E9EA0
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x864DBA4B
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x0838ACBC
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0x6BEB1E33
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x3FCA71B3
coronet."
0xAE91EE9B

0x8D5AA8FB
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xA64D0335
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0xCFED7B2D
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x8C0D09D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0xD110ED0A
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x3182F212
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x606BAA02
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0xBB9E5BB3
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0xEE676F47
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0xC82A8364
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x704B2B71
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0x85B35434
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x2C817928
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0x10AE9847
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x7A133C6D
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0x5FF3DC8B
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x60D33270
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x3E73388D
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x7CDDA914
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xD9A1282D
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x61568C53
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x8C05E2A8
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x94CD02FF
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xE7456B8A
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x635A9D8E
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x1942E56A
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x4B617C96
moment."
0x24BBD521

0x8D5AA8FB
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0xB504483C
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x3C81177C
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0x27DF3B44
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0xC32BCCF8
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0x7D360164
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0xE13D9635
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0x0B48CF05
Jane?--repeat it."
0x379952A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0x68F596F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0x378799A3
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0xB5325D99
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xF9F2B280
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x293637B5
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x5D1D47B4
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x02976592
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0x3F9888EB
incensed than saddened."
0xDA76F475

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0x3D291716
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0x6579AF53

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0x80096975
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x73B89419

0x8D5AA8FB
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x68BE39AA
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0xAB2AD129

0x8D5AA8FB
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x76BAB86C
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0xE0086DED

0x8D5AA8FB
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x5EDB7DC8
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0x7FA034BE
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x87D13727
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0xCF98EA3B
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0xCE847BD5
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0xA419024A
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0xD1D4E4EA
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0xDA090801
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x3ED3B875
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xE898C450
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0x683F89A2
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0xC3F0D37A
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x760E7F0B
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0x307CA569
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0xE88E732F
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0xC34BB0BC
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x5CA49BA2
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0xC01C7C34
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x8182E68D
woke."
0x31409C07

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x67CC0A66

0x8D5AA8FB
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x4F52BF7C
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0x562CAFF2
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0xD8A32787
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0xD741E4CC
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0xFDA112F8
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0xA8F01ECD
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x4FC9E29A
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x61436559
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x2CA14280
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0xBFAD9BE0
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x313E6169
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x4085FB35
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0x2754916B

0x8D5AA8FB
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xBF949556

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x679D0268
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0x859FA471
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0xCD3D20F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Describe it, Jane."
0x52033DB0

0x8D5AA8FB
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0x6A5E40BA
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x2649DC74
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x89A29986

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you see her face?"
0x0DA0F69B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x35D24F45
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xCE219E61
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0xC51E396A
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0x31B3BD93

0x8D5AA8FB
"And how were they?"
0xE3631E6C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0xFA14BCD3
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x839DCA7B
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0xBAF8DF5C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0x67713917

0x8D5AA8FB
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x3204F517
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0x44696058
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0x6F4B05CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"You may."
0x6E548ECF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0x31A82174

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0xD07CEB3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x3DF22099
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0x5838892D

0x8D5AA8FB
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x0CE3B381
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0x10FEA02E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Afterwards?"
0xCC1641B4

0x8D5AA8FB
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0xEB56D381
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x44246F2D
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xAD9B8500
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x047BF544
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xA25AC49A
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x21CDBE2D
from terror."
0xD7293ED5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0xE5C96745

0x8D5AA8FB
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0x4AAA7FF7
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0xF6A13729
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0x1107AAB6
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0x34A08A8C

0x8D5AA8FB
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x3551ADA1
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x1265B6CA
handling."
0x8A782BFF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0x43FBDC6C
transaction actually took place."
0x1ED3DB45

0x8D5AA8FB
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0xD9FF4C0E
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x8F2BF22B
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x7927593A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not yet."
0x32A601F2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0xEBA5F2DA
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xF9476A78
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0xCF31B12D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x8DAC629B
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0xE90ECA31
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x5F05B922

0x8D5AA8FB
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0x2188A1F4

0x8D5AA8FB
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xEA7A5AC0
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x38F35E1E
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x9FB3E3B3
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0xC35180A6
to bottom in two halves!"
0x4846341A

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0x7E8E47A3
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x2D833E5B
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x43BD36FC
might have happened!"
0x7BB8765E

0x8D5AA8FB
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0x117313F2
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0xFF09EB47

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x75BD7871
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0xE903B894
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0xEF084791
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0x22481C7F
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0xEE0C63AF
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x0F21D061
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x4316859F
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x340A26BD
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0x5E13BC3E
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x4F098EE5
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x9491FC6B
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x40336986
solution of the mystery?"
0x19FDF3EF

0x8D5AA8FB
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0x7A72122E
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0xEFF0B04A
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0xBE8890ED
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x676605DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0xA2E9A5A1
candle.
0x4D0492E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0xF35D2F25
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0x12A1F383
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x2DE2AB03
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0x01B7DF4A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0xBD6E161E

0x8D5AA8FB
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0xDFF0E6E7
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0x79113F0B
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xCB1C4E66
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0xF0E8C2AD
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x7806FFB4
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x57FC0CA8
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x86279B03

0x8D5AA8FB
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x4FA7DBD8
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0xCC527952
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0xCE1C1B2C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x936DECEF
Janet now?"
0xE7F90397

0x8D5AA8FB
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0xD8277AD0

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xFF76D9E5
love and blissful union."
0xE82FB0D7

0x8D5AA8FB
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0xC1F34C5E
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xA7750F85
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x4D212495
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x8D8E8011
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x1B151298
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0xED1529C4
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x313273FE
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x21ABC6EC
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x8F67D1E4
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0xF7569CC0
day.
0x109AE0D2

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXVI
0xB610C4E5

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0x08F7B0C6
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0x66BC1123
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0xE5781E6C
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x33017C1E
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x0FE8BB3D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0xC7E6AD31
not taken one peep."
0x62C88C82

0x8D5AA8FB
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x2384EF15
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0xD45E9F05
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0x86A02C60
by Mr. Rochester.
0xE8E49C2A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x0D3B48B8
so long!"
0xDF0A3B8E

0x8D5AA8FB
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x4825F131
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x322A639A
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0xB7F4B41C
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x460D9575
footman, answered it.
0xE0EBB577

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0x6EA5F1CB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0x620123E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x47158249

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0xF9CD5F1E
there: return and tell me."
0xCE9D9FD7

0x8D5AA8FB
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xD5548FFD
footman soon returned.
0x468BDD9C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0xC2411DFD

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the carriage?"
0x4576C808

0x8D5AA8FB
"The horses are harnessing."
0xD29C57BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0xD3BF6D04
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0xB06A6E52
coachman in his seat."
0xE77820D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x5B3739A8

0x8D5AA8FB
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x9FDAB81F
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x32BF1F0B
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x7F0CBD8E
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x4361B274
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0xE754E107
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xADC494EB
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0xFE5C86DC
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x7E5C0DBB
and flashing eyes.
0x7D2BEE37

0x8D5AA8FB
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x24D9EF01
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xC5152CBF
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x8766BE5C
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0xE48786A1
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0x6966C7BF
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x65F38D4C

0x8D5AA8FB
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0xB6D677CD
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0xEAEADFFF
me, Jane."
0x6F57A843

0x8D5AA8FB
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0x4E200E68
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x04172C9D
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0xBBF9C76F
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x31AD2F00
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x8CD4748B
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0xC60449E9
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0xE4DC7698
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0xB0C2EAAF
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x46837CB3
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0xAAAD178A
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0xED656DE4
path to the porch.
0x0318ED6D

0x8D5AA8FB
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x370606A6
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x793C6C49
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x53652152
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0xF7C11C5F
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x920D61DE
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0xD1CB0523
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x257A98AE
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x5E01E581

0x8D5AA8FB
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0xA7F58080
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0xC80389C5
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0x42D5AE3C
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x636241ED
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x2F8841E0
Rochester, went on.
0xA91AE836

0x8D5AA8FB
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0xF31A6FC7
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x109A0121
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x9ED86BFD
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0x684250B1
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0xD5D0198F
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x8CAB1CFB

0x8D5AA8FB
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0x6E0CFB78
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x6A5FC8B2
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x26E62A2A
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x476EC65E
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0xEB2A529D
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x925AE144

0x8D5AA8FB
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0x3DE05FE1

0x8D5AA8FB
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0x5F6B8CFC
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x2545472F
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x741E03A0
said, "Proceed."
0x3AEAFB31

0x8D5AA8FB
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0xC8554F1B
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xFDC3A95D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0xD8EFF381
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x3D3D7DE9

0x8D5AA8FB
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0xFA7505FD
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x8D063C0F
marriage exists."
0x5D3A52EF

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x226945E6
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x7AEE1531
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0xFE6FB380
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x87207392
beneath!
0x5F5F1AE2

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x0FEB39B7
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0xE16D6826

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x48E41E1C
advisedly."
0x596F97C4

0x8D5AA8FB
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x2E12C028
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x915C12AC

0x8D5AA8FB
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0xFC88CB9F
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x366B1B08

0x8D5AA8FB
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xF3A14296
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xFC0EF557
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xEC7DB0F1
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x00EB3B30
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0x05C42813
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xC2D5F77D
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x56198266
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x8659474B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xA99E00F2

0x8D5AA8FB
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x2C448ADE

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x564FAA2E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x8B64FABF
recognises, if you do not."
0xBC5AE26A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x596DD886
place of abode."
0xDDBA94AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xCF4D0F80
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0xA43D3503

0x8D5AA8FB
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0x2980A38D
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0xD89292E0
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x8F9FE0D5
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0x6888A345
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0x3ABCA8FA
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0xCC1A34FE
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0x60E197C5
Mason.'"
0xF878CE3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0xF16998F5
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x4885CADD

0x8D5AA8FB
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x28675F44

0x8D5AA8FB
"How do you know?"
0x1E7742A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x8A4683C7
scarcely controvert."
0x7C1E28B3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x66DEAD93

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x2C20B9AF
goodness to step forward."
0x251C4884

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0xA00B620D
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xC48E114D
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x756E4008
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x86A99598
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x06C62870
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0x3982E44E
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0x2682C8DB
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x37141569
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x9A7A461D
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x776CF32E
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x44AAF1FA
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x164C1E32
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0xCAE4E607
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0x8AA4C7E2

0x8D5AA8FB
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0xB5F341EB

0x8D5AA8FB
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x77C6731B
what have you to say?"
0x4B9CF417

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x78D1A5CA
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x977E0553
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x2839DFA1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x10516442

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x7A0C241B
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x5CC736C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0xEE3D5F62
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x07CF60D1
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x6344348A

0x8D5AA8FB
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x2FB495AA

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0xA50EF37B
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0xFE2079E7
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0xD984D921

0x8D5AA8FB
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xE5B60751
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0xDDB5F9B9
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x1B42391B
obeyed.
0x75DACE82

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x336593B9
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0xBF5E8BAD
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x5E82BD51
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x88F2232A
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0x9AC187A9
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x0D785F85
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x08A1EB17
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xDD5EB5DC
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x5853F180
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x3E45236B
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x8D943BEB
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xB4E72548
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x58E59F5F
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x057407EB
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x9AD12B89
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0xC395A9EA
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0xD58408EA
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0xBA707196
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x3D93920C
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x99BA5155
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0x7C1D07DF
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x9A5E4D99
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x76BE5CB9
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0xE05CF87D
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x8F0BFBE3
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0x7414D42D
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x10243481
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0xD42BEC9A
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x9A8C1AF0
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x4D77200E
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x1DF94426
you--follow!"
0x7ADD6EB7

0x8D5AA8FB
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x9FC1249B
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x831EAF7D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0xB7ADCE0B
will not be wanted to-day."
0x6A95FDFC

0x8D5AA8FB
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0x12223A30
greet us.
0x5DE37875

0x8D5AA8FB
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x472BDE37
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0x317CC47E
late!"
0x01C54E62

0x8D5AA8FB
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x13A691CF
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0xEF51662A
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x5A7D1D16
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xD75CA122
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0x84D9DBFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xC366E395
here."
0x244B31FD

0x8D5AA8FB
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x312650F8
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0xBA92FE67
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x3B48A8B0
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x9416A981
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0xD2F5BFC8
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0xBA6279F3
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x04A4838C
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xC365E75A
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x482CF0E6
mane, hid its head and face.
0xF05B2D19

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x27D58B3F
your charge to-day?"
0x45871D36

0x8D5AA8FB
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x2A65F67A
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x15A1C085

0x8D5AA8FB
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x01E9CF67
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x6E62D71F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0xBD1E284D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0xCB0ADB1B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0xC1EF2B97

0x8D5AA8FB
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0xB263B040
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0xF4BCDEB1
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x56A40737

0x8D5AA8FB
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xF32D688E
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x1022EBF8

0x8D5AA8FB
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x876E40F4
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x13FC6869

0x8D5AA8FB
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0xDBE5C58A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x204A7592

0x8D5AA8FB
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x8BC7A6C5
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x5A96B1C8
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0x6F444EFE
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0xA0F0ED59
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x1B3F82ED
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xC27C0374
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x294A0201
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x58FD12B7
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0xE9E7D938
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0xC9FB4FF1
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x5158EF64
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0xAAD3E62F

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0x9187313F
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0x35D8F666
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x44840218
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x3009CAB2
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x9099DDA2
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xCF76AD23
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x00313A42
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x5E28EC84
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x78528142
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x50C38875

0x8D5AA8FB
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xBD51ECD6
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0x6AE84624
the stair.
0x291E39FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0xBC483E51
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x559C798A
returns to Madeira."
0x95078E5D

0x8D5AA8FB
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0xF387F5DD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xABE39B96
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0x4E4C13A5
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x4C41D1B2
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x77E0A857
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0x533C1F9C
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0xC1F14C39
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x61E69BA9
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0xE448C76A
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x8E984AE8
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xB908368D
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0xD1B04C82
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x340DCF4A
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0xA12A5193
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0xBBCA8044
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x3BB23C96
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0x30F4CD33
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x3C472EEC
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0x3F2CA5C6
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0x862F3345

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xD9B5AFEB
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0x56523AAE
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0x7AD02430
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x59EF4794

0x8D5AA8FB
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x4D422A9C
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x39A29872
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0xE8ECF24B
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xA94ABFC6
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0xC2762B3B
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x77B1C7D7
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0xDFB0A2AA
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x71249847
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0x66D5FD8D
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0x23406E95

0x8D5AA8FB
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x3991E47E
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0xBB9BE1F1
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0x7667FE04
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0xE8F375EC
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0xE9FC935F
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xE6B95701
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0xBB09A0EA
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0xB2B68120

0x8D5AA8FB
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0xBA4727A8
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x383CB926
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0x65D8C647
prospects?
0xBA64A72A

0x8D5AA8FB
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x9375A9E2
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x2DDC7590
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0xA079C37D
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x957E9701
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x01E086DD
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x34C9E627
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xA5328A95
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0x8BA1DC4E
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xF6158A63
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x1361DADA
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x2A2EFF62
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x9DD8454C
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xDAF456C4
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x3A853630
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x4597D2DB
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x73AC9E9D
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0xBEDA7819
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x77B93ED3
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0xB3C136CF
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0xEB30E13E
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x3EA45D40
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x54EAE360
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x45FAE389
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0x8320AB83
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0xCA675AFC
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x64AA41E2
conduct!
0x005C4802

0x8D5AA8FB
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0xFA314D39
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x0A843713
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0xC7499DB9
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x1509C2AD
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x5CD4F83E
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0x6ECC1B55
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x036C71AD
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0xB586AA1F
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x947FC81C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x2DC6710B

0x8D5AA8FB
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0xF3B3D355
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x798F7217
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x9F099EB2
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x85E362DD
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x3163FAEF
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x87F99A05
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0xA07B1187
floods overflowed me."

CHAPTER XXVII
0xA64A875E

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x43261682
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x922B1067
"What am I to do?"
0x21AE8F2E

0x8D5AA8FB
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xF94F16BF
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x88047F86
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0xF00BC58D
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0xB400EC31
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x9A983B81
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0xD347FB66
cannot do it."
0x8D751F6D

0x8D5AA8FB
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x26D55E39
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0xBD232124
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0x79C7CD55
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x7B0332D2
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x9C498BF1
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x2041DCF0
depths of agony.
0xC171DA0E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x6DAA095F

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0xBC64D14A
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x5027F3C6
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x633A17DE

0x8D5AA8FB
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0xC4B647F0
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x5247A349
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0xF9315D49
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x6CA30C79
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x33DA8B41
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0x122102B3
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x1FC6C1CC
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x6F5E56AA
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x6D02A7AD
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x9A496CA1
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x3461AD46
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0x85F23811
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0x8A9B09B7
threshold.
0x579BFC67

0x8D5AA8FB
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x6FC50900
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0x07D500D0
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x75E1F0DD
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xF98B7021
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0xD20BA2AF
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x52A6CDB5
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0x7AF98BA0
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0x0B43D2D1
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x931A0070
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0xD8BC0C4A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0xE9350878
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x7E24CF40
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x1B905000

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0xF4D03806
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x4B083ACE
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0xCC72ACDE
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xA1A08553
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x64BBBDA5

0x8D5AA8FB
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0xAA6B1829
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x339920DA
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x4979A0D5
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xE73866BE
heart's core.
0x8DE641B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x10313A9E
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0xE7AFE08C
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0x7CC7171D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0x80E688EF

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xA1B03CCF
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0xF03A00F6
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x25C59018
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x271517C8
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x4D71CBBC
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x6171F794
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x7C243E00
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x0BB34547
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0xB9B6A9B0
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x12C535D9
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x65FBFB92
him."
0xA6DBC707

0x8D5AA8FB
"How are you now, Jane?"
0xD88EF3C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0xC3B26971

0x8D5AA8FB
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x89A10EE9

0x8D5AA8FB
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x3E12A11D
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xBC18A699
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0x5FD6DEFB
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x7251B90C
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xDD94F623
put his aside.
0xF3F1CF08

0x8D5AA8FB
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x311712C4
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x09BE9303
appropriated?"
0x1C62FAC9

0x8D5AA8FB
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x6C222DF0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0x1D5BFD23
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x5B566591
rightly?"
0x391C2250

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x6796925E
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x674312CD
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xE3ED7EC1
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0xE252B53D
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0xC607C3BC
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x206A27D8
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x22768FD8
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x9C9950EE
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x9DAEBB33
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x1A6C9C63
know you--I am on my guard."
0x2493D36A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x62C4FB32
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0x801F0037

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x8EEA5845
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0xD7AC2A1D
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x287DBC57
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0xEF5A5381
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0xABEAE39D
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0xFE3C54F5
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x416D2171
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x07CED772

0x8D5AA8FB
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0xED8D6E4F
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x682770FC
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0xC6C2AEF0
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x3229AAD9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x1F9F1C3F
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x09FBB425
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x9509C577
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0x699591CC
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xF82B568E
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xA2F9A198
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x92BCBB63
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0xA15E78A7
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0xDC45F4C1
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0x7FE7A77D
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0x1CC06483
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x5C168C3A
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0xFADA3D21
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x1300F32D
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0xF708F88A
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0xF1700510
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x678DC9EF
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0xA1111718

0x8D5AA8FB
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0x3BC5E676
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x873504AF
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x0BA45D9D
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0xF320F6A8
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0xE398EB74
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x1084AF56
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x4DF7823F
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0xE9E60D88
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x2DF10599
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x5462F1EF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xB79B58E0
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xD4CBD394
cannot help being mad."
0x25CE465B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x1993210E
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x5260EE19
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x3A443750

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do indeed, sir."
0xABF22899

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0x07C0507B
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0xAA5953FA
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x06DAA477
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x85C426A7
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xAC012617
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x7A6819F0
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0x74663F21
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0x56F241F5
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x939185E0
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x05587A9A
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x94244063
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0xF2ADF4C8
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x9F509F6C
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x22A62795
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x1B5191A2
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0xF4610C79
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x98DD7B13
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0xF38EEE24
falsehood and slander."
0xF7D27BA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xB48F8DB0
for you."
0x190E8F28

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x18FC1DE7
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x11119DEF
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0x18E8A1C0
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xE89938E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x1B61BFCA
too dull for you."
0xD36EAFC8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0x7CD85CA9
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x4909E534
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0x5A414A8A

0x8D5AA8FB
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x560E4EF5
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xD37D9548
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xFA427D3A
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x60298F07
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xFCBB6A66

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0xFFFEF2E1
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x4EC6D739
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0xF44536FA
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0x679C5864
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x0F6D0F50
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xB93108C1

0x8D5AA8FB
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x7E580D8B
before me.
0x15CDBAD7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xBA1AC3C3
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0xA1E65421
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x64B81FBE
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x205F8683
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0x94E07713
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0x94CB13D6
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0x2F0D0FDE
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x2E49F142
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xAB3AF461
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x4D84FAB6
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0xF340163A
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x29FCFC45
soothingly--
0x815CD432

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0xC4A26839
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0xA2331D74

0x8D5AA8FB
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x00F25455
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x7DF20845
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0x28184693
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x3402CEE3
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x15DD9B9E
heartily.
0xE55657EE

0x8D5AA8FB
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x2EC0ACA2
not while he was in such a passion.
0x2DA9D34A

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0xBC0B39BB
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x05328CC8
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x8E1231D6

0x8D5AA8FB
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0xC1689785
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0x14819291
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0xEAEC045B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xAC99ECD2
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x4C339189
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0xF2E53C65
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x05AA9719
were some toad or ape."
0x9A4F7B64

0x8D5AA8FB
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x6818B966
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x0463EF00
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x78C418F2
where I had wounded.
0xE668BAAD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0xACC7C570
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x618AC7D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0x9797F735
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0xF0AB532B

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0xD25BE2A0
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0x8D2016FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x4E0429EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0x95944880

0x8D5AA8FB
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0x8B81B20D
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x5B010443

0x8D5AA8FB
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0xA984DDF8
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0xC247F13C
scenes."
0x0564DC2B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x991C0064
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x4840DB12
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xD1B73CEA
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0x14F9F02A
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0xD6A58286
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0xE2EDD35B
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0x838662D7
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0xAA1AD289
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x1C020A3E
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x211C8E6D

0x8D5AA8FB
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0xBD982C5F
still I dared to speak.
0x3B07F724

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x9C3CB0E4
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0xABDB0A73
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x14292353

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x5FF8F5BC
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xB7A36FE5
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0xEAFA25F4

0x8D5AA8FB
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xFBFC5A5F
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x96AE2E21
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0xCBAEC075
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x9B9D4EB3
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x94CB5B93
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0x4FA75F69

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0x471DD21B
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0xF34EF3F4
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0x643E2121
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x75BA8CF8
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0xE7555198
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0xBF348B55
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0x731B8BC0
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0x93AD2C79

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xDF578C92

0x8D5AA8FB
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x940B468E
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0xABC24251

0x8D5AA8FB
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0x73EDC62B

0x8D5AA8FB
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0xDBDEF936

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have understood something to that effect."
0x806BEF08

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0xF2EF3C0C
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0xCB5E4BF1
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x8BC2C02D
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x907D3045
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x6F81D3A5
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x31054CC9
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x40130A14
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x26D07056
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0xCE1B3C88
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0x5E06973C
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x607E3B0A
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xAEC29779
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0xC445772F
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0xA0BE5306
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x2BF12AD6
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0xAA2193FF
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0xCC4DE13E
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xF4275D2F
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x33D8F505
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x48242E11
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0xE80E6974
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x731E1D77
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0x970F073F
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0x2394F330
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x181B9CBB
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x72045FA9
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x942301D8
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x8539E0D7
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x5248633E
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0xFC2C7A46
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x8B4617E1
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x4EDA47A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x5268CBEC
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0x339C661D
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0x9123CE51
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0xB3E21DC9
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0xCD1D61A6
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x13BA89D7
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x404277E8
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x157E7496
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x39DFB74C
plot against me."
0xE1433318

0x8D5AA8FB
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0xD8793B14
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0xF03C9EE2
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xB03F8149
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0xEA2DBA86
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0x29673C3B
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0x112C10CF
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x578A0D62
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x595569D4
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x38F210DF
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x77A2CC1B
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0xE33F1858
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x97416668
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0xA0830A62
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x5CFEAE12
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0xCA27CC75

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0xFD422061
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x7FC74093
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0xBC16B251
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0x8D718CEB
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x527735F3
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0xC4304E7E
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x116F18FA
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0x25438AF3
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x8716ECC9
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0x828C59F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0xF17DCD27
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0xD05ECDB6
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x9957587F
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0xCF4403F3
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x7A8F8A0B
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x2F40A899
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0x27C083B2
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0x8E3B62C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xC1106FEE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0xE0C06486
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0xCA64CD6C
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0xD524AF10
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0xFCFD55D9
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0x4646065A
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0x81BFF2DA
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0x47052DCA
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x1B60C121
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0xA19131F8
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0xC2AD2B31
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0x79621A85

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0x6CFF78E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0xE1221EBE
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0x6F9A0018
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x1F99EC6A
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x8CB3B3C6
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0xE3754E41
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x393B793C
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x970C43BD
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x19F9B55C
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x60B75E59
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x412F4281
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xCCD9F8CF
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x216366B6
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x69554890
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0x3E824A26

0x8D5AA8FB
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x5B3BF50A
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0x2BA08428
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0xFFA3BC86
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0x1BEBEDB4
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x57BA73D1
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0x0838C5FA
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xB4485144
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0xF57E100B
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0xFB485935
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0x706E9B82
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0xD099AC2C
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0x8A7F428A
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xCA7EE553
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xB467362D
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x13AAD2A7
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
0xEAB2AB91

0x8D5AA8FB
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0x5A3E7C5F
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0xEEF35EC0
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0x27D5E995
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0x5C7A6AAF
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x3A651A12
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0xF6170B6A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0xFE16DAA7
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0x592D46C6
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0x1A039CBF
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0xAD2AF174
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0xC2585B2E

0x8D5AA8FB
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0xB34C906B
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0x8EBFF256
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0x04961C89
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0x03B4679F
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0x7055765B
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0x45B02558
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0x764383F2
follow.
0xFF4B1C63

0x8D5AA8FB
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0x22A3C15A
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x8386C425
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0x30C91266
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0x6565B996
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0xD7110293
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0xB4B66248
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0x68320AFA

0x8D5AA8FB
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0xBFBE2206
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0xF3D556C3
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0x18065B97
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0x157C8063
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0xCF45EE4C
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0x06682452
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0x4A594A62
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0x8F0F154C
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0xBEBB7D41
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0x750C6BE1
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0x7FF6EC9D
and leave her.'
0xA1EC9804

0x8D5AA8FB
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0x54258754
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0x2249C101
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0x122610DA
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0xBA43D5AB
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x40DEFA5F
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0x08022083
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x5ADEED25
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0x4D69514F
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0x09277FF1

0x8D5AA8FB
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0xA851D52A
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0xD19808B4
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0xC756AC81
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0x01FBEAF3
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0x307A82D3
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x60DC388A
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x4DC0B0FB
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0xA1449A16
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0xD6AB8BE1
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0xD78A1980
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x6B7E4CAA
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0x22D1941A
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0x0E8AD481
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x72B89CC3
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x273E44F1
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x92CDE3DA
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0xEFC549F1
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0xEB0D5B1C
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x9F3EE786
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x6222C69F
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0x8374811F
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0xAC7F0FB8
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x2DA9F121
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x020490D0
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x029D1179
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0x094C240B
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0xF99BEDD6

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xA6364985
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0x4E503664

0x8D5AA8FB
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0xAA5477E9
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0x9A552434
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0x03222963
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x336A4E9F
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0x8C6A5611

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x1A20F1F0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0x1A8FEC76
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0xE16E4D2E
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x1D483CE8
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0xFA23AB4B
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0x65CDCF90
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x7962BBD9
burdened."
0x73D4A084

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, sir?"
0xE2E58B60

0x8D5AA8FB
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0xE31C4F51
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0x170F9A63
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x4B813CFF
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0xBF8B3D21
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0x1BB1501D
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0x505BA9EC
don't very well know why."
0x812703B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0x9DD5C7A0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0x1BA9E67B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0x0E9AD7A5
and what she said."
0x1A281D42

0x8D5AA8FB
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0xA46F4165
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0xCD4E3866
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x34DE6ABF
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0x62110EB0
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x71F99E2B
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x06DCEC0A
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x66F023A9
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xDE1172EE
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x56F68EF9
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x3C14EB44
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0xA120D85F
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0xBCD7BD00
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x556AE944
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x7CC0B843
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x969C6AB7
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xAC74BBAC
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x975F4C96
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0x47FA376A
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0xA01577CB
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0x4D1928B4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0xA8F7E614
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0x8180B9CC
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0x16BC2EF3
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0xFF28B22C
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0x7756F111
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0x6FDBBD4C
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x7BB150AB
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0xDDDA5849
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x6876CBD4
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x9CB97185
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0xD83C8DC3
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0x2AC645E5

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0xD61C1002
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x5F4D8C94
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0x1E291DCB

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0xA8D65562
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x51045D86
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0x51FA1510
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0xAC6D4E91
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0xF475C836
Giacinta, and Clara."
0xB27F2E9C

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x21F8A148
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x3567AB38
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x8F9CE6F0
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x076B46AE
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0xF89C6CA4
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xC2898074
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x912A32E2
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x73C336C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0x29CDA40A
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x7BCDA1AC
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x2731254F
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x3B46D957
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0x5979DE58
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x36508F17
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x9980F770
back to England.
0x501D9548

0x8D5AA8FB
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0x737AAD4C
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xC7A87CB3
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xC2016BCF
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x31DAC379
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0xB60C13B3
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x775307BF
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0xF1ABCE69
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0xC4E09068
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x4306E35A
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x8745FA1D
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xE638F607
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0xE83F2FE8

0x8D5AA8FB
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0xCDA28019
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0x44337386
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0x18588477
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x732320F4
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x83F34792
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x4CC8B162
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x0BC9FE9D
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xB698AD26
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0xE82AFFB7
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x1FF269C9
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0xC0BCC883
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x553C3350
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0xD7FD5042
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x93EBBBEB
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0xD861A48B
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xEE3CFAF3
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xBBC88148
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x315B0505
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x44CEF5C5
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0xADF84773
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x3050B803
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xD87C8174
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x2ED97941
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0xB2CF2CDD
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x7DB38A31
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0xFD123E8B
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x11702C7C
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x93F71EDA
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x18CB6CF0
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x6EE43866
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0x30B5B5BF
out of my sight.
0x7087246A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xDC3D949B
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0xBC204DB1
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0xE4A334D2
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0xD537EC14
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0xFC40AEE7
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0xB3FEDB97
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x30C35373
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0xD57AEFD8
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0xE01A3EFA
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x2A2B6D5B
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x80EEF60E
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0x1ED1D74C
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x42DB7764
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x94C0A789
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xD5726CDD
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xC87CA545
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x22771E2F
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x6C48B0CD
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0xA0C15EB4
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x6076557D
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xA96B5DE9
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0xC748B102
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xFAD887FD
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xEAE25B99
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x9B5131CF
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x54C3EEB5
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x7F502366
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x9F34A568
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x003FDC5C
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0xEEB79C76
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0x46D0B823
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0xF5A18517
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0x2BAC4023
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0xBFCEAF5B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0xF3070E9B
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x4296C9C8
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0xAA765BE1
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0xDB25BB88
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x6F243842
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0xE61FB798
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0xD6A35D69
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0xF07B9DE8
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0xC7B74308
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x3FB85024
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0xBDD9D631
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0xFEDA349F
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0xE60327C0
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0x26C14BDB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x496C83CA
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0xE2E1870F
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xC5DA1449
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0x9DD0EF03

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x6160A504
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0xB0B395F4

0x8D5AA8FB
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0x4DB340DD

0x8D5AA8FB
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0xDA268071
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0xDF5F5302
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x5480973D
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x04C4F284
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x0FBC38E4
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xC7C08627
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x6D0638EA
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0xEDA4B936

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xAD2C6303
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x62C4ED36
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x6D71AAE8
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0x9F31038C
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0xC7C94783
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x1A2422C8
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0xDB99D354
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x3BAA1A8F
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x72C78679
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x7D5EF7F6
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x8A605B01
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x4DB10115

0x8D5AA8FB
A pause.
0x1F6E2CFC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x48A146CD

0x8D5AA8FB
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x0B7BC19D
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0x0115B241
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x6CA039C5
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x84A83902
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x84C86C0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x8BA39A2F
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0xCECFADB0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x7970B3E8

0x8D5AA8FB
Another long silence.
0x89D8BB6A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xCE5D852B
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x3DFBA6AE
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x56A0A87B
and to let me go another?"
0x01BF527C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do."
0x91D5560E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x775651A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do."
0x91D5560E

0x8D5AA8FB
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0x530BE638

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0x9806859E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x4ED56798
to love me."
0x773DB91B

0x8D5AA8FB
"It would to obey you."
0x44561732

0x8D5AA8FB
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0x09EB1AC4
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0xC4918595
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x0E903176

0x8D5AA8FB
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0xEDB2FD4D
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x1CE95729
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x8956555A
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xEEA30F0D
companion and for some hope?"
0x483D8A77

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x981E6EDC
again there."
0xE2E0DFE0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you will not yield?"
0x1C9E0E1C

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0xB8E29D47
rose.
0xDB83627E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x1E549E36

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x60307D74
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x6DEA9DE8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0xDC361AF7
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x596D4610
will forget me before I forget you."
0x6D9AA7B8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0xA14824D4
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0xAC4DA483
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0xC9018B2E
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x4EE4785A
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0xD539DC99
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0x10AE3C05
by living with me?"
0xA3A95A83

0x8D5AA8FB
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0xC5A8B0B1
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0x81224EB5
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0xC88D7250
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x10EEC53D
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x74E56980
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0xF08E1A86
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x7E2589CC
who will be injured by what you do?"
0xDBD75F6F

0x8D5AA8FB
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x4D765147
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0xA1169EBC
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x70192188
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x562786DD
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x9359E81E
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0xE7C4C119
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0xAE1058BE
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0x11E6D709
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0xA721651B
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x4504F90A
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x4F3D8E36
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x64B90CCC
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xD4AC2CE2

0x8D5AA8FB
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x1398570F
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x9B9C1B48
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0xDD412B41
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0xF9D0ECD3
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x4D98F137
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x5FBEF1A7
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0xC698A966
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x4F81E314
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0x7C6A6C77
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x3EA4C5B9
strength almost exhausted.
0xD0A098A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0xFDF7DC85
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0xE06F2589
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0xA0EC486A
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0x500A01E0
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x3068CEAE
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0xBF030B06
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0x9D4824A6
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x28F57830
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0xD0C2FDAA
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x697F00AD
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x9D161C21
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x8891EDDE
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x80756DC4
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0xD37BE480
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x88966483

0x8D5AA8FB
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0xA1CC973A
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0xF9EC1A86
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xA82D6186
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0xD2ECFEAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are going, Jane?"
0xF2F3A96D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am going, sir."
0x310371EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are leaving me?"
0x12C3A647

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x1A2450BF
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x082EA632

0x8D5AA8FB
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x7BFB0FA7
firmly, "I am going."
0x9D47ECA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane!"
0xC3360555

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x9E675CC9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x7F9E90A1
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0x40D68619
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x9B3E8356

0x8D5AA8FB
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0xFE72EB9E
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x413F0BC1
deep, strong sob.
0x31ECEEEB

0x8D5AA8FB
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x23BB2CC7
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x0CD0321F
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0xD7FC76A4
hand.
0xF1F50298

0x8D5AA8FB
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0x34C1F4C1
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0x8F54D096
me."
0x94BBE9E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x43C00B00
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0x641BE0A4
yes--nobly, generously."
0x8FD7B02E

0x8D5AA8FB
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0x7C03C81F
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x4A571D68
once quitted the room.
0x7E91B962

0x8D5AA8FB
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x826239FB
"Farewell for ever!"
0x48FA2204

0x8D5AA8FB
* * * * *
0x9BA0633A

0x8D5AA8FB
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x6CA42685
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x7D170757
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x9DB90172
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0xC7819030
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xFB63DBD5
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x3C150728
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0xB4047FFC
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x18789586
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x4CE50E16
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x32DC8E4C
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0x0B39DFD6
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0xB81E6849
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0xB02A28E7
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x011B3E61
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0xE86B2729

0x8D5AA8FB
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x39A56F80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mother, I will."
0x605CE776

0x8D5AA8FB
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x7D72C53B
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x6D0DEEAC
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x0DB41E2B
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x90C34CC5
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x0E150C82
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x476CEA93
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0x30198AAB
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0x38E390AD
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xB8ED3ED2
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x3E09A833
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x0A45583E
from my room.
0xCE87CEA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x29D7AFC4
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0xCA768CED
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xFAEB28DB
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0x4406BE99

0x8D5AA8FB
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xA138ECFD
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x5656AD17
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0xEACEC438
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x2012D797
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x5659E0E1
to go in and to say--
0xA132C506

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x96C0CE98
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0xF41FE05E
this.
0x12CF273F

0x8D5AA8FB
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x95DFEC09
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0xC8FDEBB3
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x1FEFA4D9
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0xCCFD9675
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x76C99352
on.
0x4632A59F

0x8D5AA8FB
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0x92BFDBD4
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0xEBCAD543
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xE7E28B74
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0xB5B7F0DE
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x6944C68F
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x40010E1E
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x60A142FA
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0xA195CAA9
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x75052F45

0x8D5AA8FB
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x065D14FA
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x538E7528
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x0A4CF0DB
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0xB777413A
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x926F216B
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x1EE78A69
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0xAD214BAB
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0xEF8CDA48

0x8D5AA8FB
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0x864B42DF
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x2BF0EAA3
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x0C1A561E
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xA3ED8CDB
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0xF3D8C0A8
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x8377C0B7
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x9E504B4D
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0xAF920496
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x869B3185
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xB196C082
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x00E41DAA
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0xBA03570E
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x22E4E44B
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x106A3CD8
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x931C84FA
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x8939235F
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xB1CCB373
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x6B1E04A8
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0xDA02B6E7
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0x6DBB512C
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x70E0048F
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x15D3B3EA
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0x930A6BF4
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0xB34C3439
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0xBB1EFC6A
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x064DEF82
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0xCBE47DE1
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x7B8D44C4
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x4F383635
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xC2628A68
ever to reach the road.
0x67CC82E8

0x8D5AA8FB
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x7CE6C5B5
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xCB940EAB
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x29763EB8
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x574C5BB1
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x50B5395B
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0xF9EE1542
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x668830CD
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0xBDD0E1DD

0x8D5AA8FB
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x0104C367
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xDFE9622D
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x1C9E42B2
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0x43428996
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.
0x19644D82

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXVIII
0xAD049F0E

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0xB67531B4
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0x2E002A90
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0x624577A1
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x543AFF10
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0x72D1475F
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0xA13079FB
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x848E29D5

0x8D5AA8FB
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0xBC587619
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0x0FF13B23
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x899C4AE9
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0x261E0342
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x0721BED7
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xEB6FF996
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0xAD5B7FC8
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xB2826D6B
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0xF22689EB
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x9F27D762
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x5987A0F6
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x78659715
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x68889762
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0xBFC06851
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0xCFEFDDEF
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x22109555
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x4CF7D712
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0xF9F336A1
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x9ACA62FA
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0xE1853A51

0x8D5AA8FB
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x215A097A
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x9A708005
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0x33C51B05
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x397018E3
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0x7A0BA3A5

0x8D5AA8FB
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x91B3A32B
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0xB421212D
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0xCD5C9459
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0x2394AE1C
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0xF1325D60
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0xA4F83CDB
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0x991F24FE
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x667738BC

0x8D5AA8FB
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x952EC89D
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x12BD67FF
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x80AE5E07
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x9ACAE6F9
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0xFD71ADE3
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0xE72872D7

0x8D5AA8FB
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0x45F4FBE4
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x87388F8B
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0xFB51E703
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x1010E44F
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0xD0D97C94
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0xBA8D8292
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x2E19AADE
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x32B83AE2
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0xD99D9B7E
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xB246C9DE
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0xC659ADD2
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0xB99C1158
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x81907F7B
then chose my couch.
0x5FBA4467

0x8D5AA8FB
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x330C9CF7

0x8D5AA8FB
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x6877F33A
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x9E1CFBE7
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x73917C11
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0xF95B2844
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x41C60E0F

0x8D5AA8FB
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x1DE96474
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0xCF637974
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x35F339BA
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0xEE834303
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0x431B80D3
attempts to seek him.
0xC07DAC19

0x8D5AA8FB
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0x99EAB5C8
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x1471CAE6
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xC7937D8A
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0x867223BB
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0xA4921832
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0xF9FE6379
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x437AFC26
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0xDB1C1C8A
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x111A8A3B
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x9DD11593
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xB1DD28E0
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x559F1A82
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x7D5A27C4
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0x3E956227
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x0D787B01
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x851F0087

0x8D5AA8FB
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0x7C29D4B2
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0xD75850D1
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x4B7CFCFE
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0xB8C11C86
looked round me.
0xE16B3F0B

0x8D5AA8FB
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x2BD4896D
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x2F13376D
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x64D21E8B
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0xFC3DD4F6
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x8ABA8E55
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0xF0E0E79B
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x5DB5368B
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x71EB554E
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x7CF3A925
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xD569686E
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0xFD2B568B
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x4558CEB2
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0x38F08222
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0x20CD177C
out.
0x91178187

0x8D5AA8FB
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0xD46717F4
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x939C0ADF
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0xF5DDB836
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0x29C3FA9C
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x80718DBB
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0x797CA7F8
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0xB4C88209

0x8D5AA8FB
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0xB4375B26
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x01ABA9E3
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0x425F6D5A
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x0AA655B6
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x446CB4E2
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0xB9295E21
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x269A7465
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x431651CC
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x93F45C3C
like the rest.
0xE1238708

0x8D5AA8FB
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0xCD328F17
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x99FED687
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0xCB96C97A
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0xB5A20AE8
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0xC60B54FB
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0xC01792DC
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0xA6BADD47
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x9D0CA81A
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0xB7454D01
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0xEC8D7BC8
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0xB1C31014
would not; but I must try.
0x8BDBAB15

0x8D5AA8FB
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x8CA09FFF
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x8D35B3C2
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x90167577
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x22BAFF15
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0xF608BECA
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0xC2BA9583
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x5AB8DD1B
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0xE5726F5E
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x903036B9
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0x297C1BEA
the village?"
0x35282302

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x0B184FAE

0x8D5AA8FB
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x91D4195B
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0xB054CBDC
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0xE0228E8C
apply somewhere.  Where?
0xCD923406

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0xC1512F39
wanted?"
0xAE5E8E7A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x09997C37

0x8D5AA8FB
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x9295C2BB
do?"
0xA70324B6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0xAA205EA6
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x273A26EB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x0134B70E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x112CDBF3

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what do the women do?"
0x91817FD3

0x8D5AA8FB
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x40AB632B
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x681153E9

0x8D5AA8FB
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x0FC7DDAA
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0x8D3E89CA
wanted.  I took leave.
0x076FD9A3

0x8D5AA8FB
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0xB1A68507
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x0278175E
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x712F436B
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x5DA8E7D3
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0xD9A884D6
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0x01CB0E52
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0xD567F428
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x48545652
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x1DF3E942
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x20654505
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0xE8000C1D
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0x8AD85D0B
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0x252E11A5
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xC1DD563E
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x10114AAC
if a servant was wanted here?
0x843BDE76

0x8D5AA8FB
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x020CCD8D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0x7FE42D8D
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xAC2AB201
no matter what."
0x6F3558B6

0x8D5AA8FB
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x77E640DB
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0xDE4D22FF
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x1E9E679B
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0x19712225
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0xC204DE9C
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x38C2A569

0x8D5AA8FB
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x1E6891E6
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0xF4D9CBEE
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0xD98C7C50
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xD8B495A0
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0xA1FBBAD9
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0x669F355C
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0xCC6BE388

0x8D5AA8FB
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x332CD1D1
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0xAE615BA3
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xD09A879E
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0xDF7779B1
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x5CCB3488
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0xC39167BF
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0x8CFD3041
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0x262C6190
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xD6F4AD6E
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0xC52961C8
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0xD32E6134
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0xEECDF252
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0x6B79086E
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x51F92707
this the parsonage?
0x656617C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Was the clergyman in?"
0x330125B1

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would he be in soon?"
0x28C0EDE9

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, he was gone from home."
0x978FF0EE

0x8D5AA8FB
"To a distance?"
0xE79734FF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x8D895D7A
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0x411AC22E
there a fortnight longer."
0xFB06B714

0x8D5AA8FB
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0xCD7DAFEC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x6F2E2E31
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x95BD4684
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x7D9F4CE5

0x8D5AA8FB
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x612BA59B
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0x87725F5C
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x260F6421
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0xA4AF43DB
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0x278B5AA8
for this handkerchief?"
0x1BEB277F

0x8D5AA8FB
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0xA167E08C
that way."
0xB06F4D59

0x8D5AA8FB
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x7F8B58AC
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x45CA22E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x8FEE9B74

0x8D5AA8FB
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xBBEB951E

0x8D5AA8FB
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0xB49BB61B
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0xFA7256F2
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0xEE39ACE2
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0x1C98AD91
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0xADE98D1D
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x21A08378
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xD79F6D6A
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0xA562EB85
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0xF8D3E7F3
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xB5D0A0B6
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0xE787F3CF
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0xFB0F0ED2
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x18EEF6A2
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x73602F7D

0x8D5AA8FB
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0xD9D94C38
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x5100A635
said--
0xE3981FA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x95078A6A
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0xF63AAEBC
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x67AF5F25
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x813EE692
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x1FA0112F

0x8D5AA8FB
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0x3E491C58
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0xADE22E15
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x0FAB06A8
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xA7801391
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x526C8DDC
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xF430B892
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0xC230F322
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0xAFD64C13
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x56C11A19
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x2CC71EFC

0x8D5AA8FB
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x683C8081

0x8D5AA8FB
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0x91AECE55
give her these porridge."
0xFFEE44F4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x566A1D9F
pig doesn't want it."
0x4AADA444

0x8D5AA8FB
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x0E753A51
ravenously.
0x5FCF87BD

0x8D5AA8FB
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0xDCFA28E9
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0xF26A139D

0x8D5AA8FB
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x2FCC9974
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x8E82CAA2
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0x141A8402
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x6C7C7C0E
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0xB86A329E
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xB36013FC
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x0D9EB151
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0xF0929771
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x0C2C7190
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0x890C51BC
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0xEAB9FB7E

0x8D5AA8FB
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0xE266F9CD
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x64D09EE1
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0xB6BE15FC
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0xC3EEAEC5
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x3B9EDC1D
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x5F10F476

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0xCA7A6B15
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0xAEFFB0BA
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0xEE55B0E5
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x75CBEDA5
grave."
0x5A20FD47

0x8D5AA8FB
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0xED7CCD29
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0xE519993A
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0xA0A80396
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x864B81F1
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0xD4A59F20
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xBA5C42C8
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x617FF857

0x8D5AA8FB
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xC2667899
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x381CDE43
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x53A448D3
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x441A73ED
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x8655C32D
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x7FA9BC86
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0x69DC7C29
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0xE4D46D46
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x38546DD9
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xC0DF2D20
it shut in my face."
0x32A97B9B

0x8D5AA8FB
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0xC67FB81F
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0x04A9DE61
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x9CCCBCAE
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0x563EC2B9
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x7769CB30
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0xF4EE516D
long.
0x2B93861D

0x8D5AA8FB
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x8C2545E0
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x4F9B9C7C
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x41A22761
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0x9B4C1221
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0x5BD24A70
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x7E1B00FE

0x8D5AA8FB
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0x9AC0D25A
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x2AE9EAF2
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x8C88E516
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x94869B87
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0x492DD8A5
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x1F8FCAF0
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x783620E7
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0x0BA10D19
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0xF84A5BF3
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x2B1C373C
sable bush-holly or yew.
0xB929C02B

0x8D5AA8FB
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0x9562DD8F
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0xFE3C487D
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0xD94EC8AD
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0x9D42D8EE
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x6EA069E7
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x2CF671AA
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xCD03E8D8
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x787C5D1F
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0x1A5238E1
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x2D259D5D
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0x83B10A25
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0x794C9AF9
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x5434AF94
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x034D5FC3
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x324608DF
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x82074317
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x3A4B91ED

0x8D5AA8FB
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0xDDC798CA
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x68D0EEDA
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0xA71A73FA
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xEAFA43AA
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x88878CA5
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x1B24484E
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x7D6987DA
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0x78E28DD6

0x8D5AA8FB
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x079212D1
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x8A2E73A4
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0xA17961AE
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x0CF1E455
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x38325A5F
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x44CE6A83
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x02747DB4
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0x163A8C21
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x94B2C483
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x7A118251
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0xC23B8309
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0x0C521CF8
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x0A3ACD95
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0xAD020152
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x0324417B
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0xAF7802B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x4D0ADB7C
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0x1B48DA28
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x48743F8C
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0xB7A503CF
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0xCA7C6738
German I could not tell.
0xAFB4BEE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x38F04A2A
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0xAC0EE0A7
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x1394B0B0
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x353B593D
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x8CA31C72
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0x47DD2B75

0x8D5AA8FB
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x646983A6
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x29E4A6B2
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0xD1787E5F
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x2B9EA93B
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0xE74A9BA1

0x8D5AA8FB
Both were again silent.
0x46C523FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0x8B07C9D7
looking up from her knitting.
0x6EF1C2B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0xF08F5D4D
other way."
0xF12085BD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x320023D6
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0xDD3717FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0xBAD843C9
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x53298066
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0xDF4CD65A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what good does it do you?"
0xD77616EF

0x8D5AA8FB
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0xAA4FDC1F
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0xDBCA968D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0xDF58ABD8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0xE1790ED8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0xA4249CDD
master but a lexicon."
0x789754DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0xAE5AC32F
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x591DEAA9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0x41C5BC0C
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x795F5D40
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xEB1119D5

0x8D5AA8FB
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x6A9CC547
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xE4F5946D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x9FEC30DA
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x6F5C19E3

0x8D5AA8FB
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x666B5218
sad now.
0x21BB24C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x083AD53C
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0xA0A825BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x742DBECE

0x8D5AA8FB
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0x04AE4D41
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0xD786753F
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x7604619E
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xCB6BEF62
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x84603DD7
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x53F2481C
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x81C0ED1E
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x20BF179E
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0xEB578BF4
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0xCBBFB167

0x8D5AA8FB
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0xBEBAA5D2
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x4726AB91
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x19E81C91
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x96609F87
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0x376E22C7
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0x096CAD86
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0xE65B5A3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x3EAA21EB
St. John when he comes in."
0xB803BE69

0x8D5AA8FB
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0x6282D7FE
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0xB3E3CD23
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0xCBB2DCBD
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0xF1304C46
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0xEB53FA7B
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0xC917A189
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0xEB99480D
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x7390F7ED
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x2CFE064F
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x6DFE1FCB

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x86E3FAD1
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xAA657320

0x8D5AA8FB
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x4CBB3BEC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x065FBE24
from?"
0x51B9347E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am a stranger."
0xE346CA2D

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x91D3BF06

0x8D5AA8FB
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0x5BB41755
bread to eat."
0xBDDD1E6B

0x8D5AA8FB
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x39A0B2FC
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x1E9C1964
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0xB2B874DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0x78608CED

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x3A3ACA18
now; it looks very ill."
0x6301E139

0x8D5AA8FB
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0xB9F32B8A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x7C98C257
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x0D8FFEC2

0x8D5AA8FB
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0xBEB83564
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x6091660A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x91467D71

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x46A2D337

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x84F54C96
make such a noise.  Move off."
0xEA8C44AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x7BF11A9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0xE5F1D842
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0xF41906BF
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0xB20D04F3
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0x127CA4EB
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0xA450FBD6
bolted it within.
0xFD9A6F74

0x8D5AA8FB
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x6644930C
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0xE9037F94
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x2C017736
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0xD5188825
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0xB7C2F105
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x0BAA8B45
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x6108D0A8
endeavoured to regain.
0x4435B7E4

0x8D5AA8FB
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x2E0E04AA
will in silence."
0x0AA6B053

0x8D5AA8FB
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0xB9822F08
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xC2F32D3E
and still.
0xC45D3E43

0x8D5AA8FB
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0xBF65A8E1
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x9B7DBBA7
if you perished here of want."
0xE24255FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x2615EF73
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x9AD004FE
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xEFD3D0E9
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x9476F164
to the door.
0x1DFC7FC9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x8DFA3716

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0xF3486BA6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x2472A6DE
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0xC6845C59
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0xEC51BE59
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x502138EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x90B875C9
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x09C95D6A
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x64482FEF
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0x2567BEC7
house."
0x52EAE004

0x8D5AA8FB
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x94A54844

0x8D5AA8FB
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0xD52F6CF2
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x39ED4899
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xBB671637
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0xB537FB7F
me.
0x75545466

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0xEC04D3DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0x9153CF87

0x8D5AA8FB
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x3661DCD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x2D771AD9
sit."
0xD62784DD

0x8D5AA8FB
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xF1DACA45
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x699DCE5B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0xDC9F8955
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xF553B987

0x8D5AA8FB
"A mere spectre!"
0xC9AC74E4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x4BCD8E4E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0x51330B24
bread."
0xC092E89F

0x8D5AA8FB
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x1C141C64
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0xC1857D8C
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x4339A95D
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x71176742
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xE0703963

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x79858BA4
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x8ED9A05C
first, eagerly soon.
0x2D15010F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0xA0BB657F
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0x535C6F67

0x8D5AA8FB
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0xAA4245AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x2753D089
name."
0x6D1530E7

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x1FB7BF5A
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x1ACE6B7B

0x8D5AA8FB
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0xDDEACE19

0x8D5AA8FB
I was silent.
0x88043F54

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x7D712A08

0x8D5AA8FB
I shook my head.
0x6729FAD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x552B990C

0x8D5AA8FB
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x3843FAE2
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xF04C4056
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0x8BAF5E27
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x70065075
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xFEDC6467
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0xBAC3D49B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x8CBECEA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x741020FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x09C3C6B6
took the word--
0x2345E4E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0xC7FC982A
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0xA86F0D01

0x8D5AA8FB
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0xD52EDB6C
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0xFE8C24B9
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0xFC4FAB9B
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x3E61ED46
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0xCBAC11B2
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xA7AE6224
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x3AC99F19
silent.
0x57C6A52B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0x02AAEF3E
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x36EEDABA
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x52DAFCA5
matter over."
0x6F9A5C23

0x8D5AA8FB
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0xA7A6D02A
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xA8887662
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0xA1D9837D
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0x10C81565
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x16A2280F
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x004253D7
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0xCAF9339D

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0xCAC3EC48
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0xACB31D62
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x67209B42
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0x3690F626
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x8CBBC6A1
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0xCAB71768
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x1E4E2420
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x056FBDFB
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x80EC430B
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x6BF39EC9
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x56B13791
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0xC79AB24F
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0x01E2EAA6
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xAC00AA9D
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x38ED673C

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is very well we took her in."
0xCDA1C937

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0x7AE3307A
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0xCE64836C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0x334B0994

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x8B32C168
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x04BDA3C3
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x39FA9D75

0x8D5AA8FB
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0xA259611A
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0xE86213A3
would be agreeable."
0xCEBAE116

0x8D5AA8FB
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0x40560294
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0x4F774638
myself.  I was comforted.
0xE99E61BD

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x9CFA33EA
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0xED07EE04
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x67ABAF9D
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xF042F8C5
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0xC4061511
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x604C51FF
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0xB7A09747
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x1DB9809E
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0xBFD703C5
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x0BC4B44D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0xF87F2F09
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xB244B01F
her permanently."
0xA0A2D61C

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x23A4687F
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0x10E0A0D6
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x060AA14F
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0xBAA84EE7
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0x2060E491
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x45BD06CF

0x8D5AA8FB
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x1DADD863

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x2F1F7377
are quite wanting in those features."
0xAAF66830

0x8D5AA8FB
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xEC94094E
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0xCA28903F
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0xD524F815
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0xDD770793
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x05141164
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0xAE67BC8A
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x4FCBCCC5
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0x3D87AE9E
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0xEFD755B7

0x8D5AA8FB
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0xC88E50A0
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xC4BC6E8A
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xA0ED144C
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0x36473261
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x6F94F578
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0xB6C2F617
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x2EE95360
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x0E7A76DD
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0xC64AA80B
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x1360B3DD
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0xA68492F6
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x215783EE

0x8D5AA8FB
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0x35D90F70
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0xF41762B4
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x2D76F83B
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0xAA029586
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x2A1211D4
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0xE31108C3
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0xB64FF0B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x91D34CFB
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x915B5202

0x8D5AA8FB
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x8DC8A455
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0xEA3ABFC7
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0x5A391AA1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0xAB0F892E

0x8D5AA8FB
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xF527EA41
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xD8274E07
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x02F7A5C7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0xEDE4C84B
than yourself or your young ladies."
0x065EB3B2

0x8D5AA8FB
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x0BD08923
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x7C7B33B8

0x8D5AA8FB
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0xD2A846E2
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0xB70A9E76

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x75BE434B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, very."
0x10C317AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x62196D13

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x61B6C115

0x8D5AA8FB
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0xC07D59EE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x67156214
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0xD11EC0FC
basket of the fruit.
0x4341064C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x4C63713D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0xA36618F9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x23D77E8B

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0xF3354305

0x8D5AA8FB
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x680B067F
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x5A295691

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x578C2262
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0xE1004DFF

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0xA426D1E7
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0xDB73F0CE
are."
0x97A94B7D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0xBFE68DB7

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0x3BDA379B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x2F0B7BBB
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xB891B430

0x8D5AA8FB
"That village a few miles off?
0x2463DB40

0x8D5AA8FB
"Aye."
0x0C4BAAA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what is he?"
0x895DDA59

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is a parson."
0xC9DC2C82

0x8D5AA8FB
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0xB25011EB
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0xB83BBCE8
residence?"
0xCCFE0D3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0x47D862C2
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x62EBCD9D

0x8D5AA8FB
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0xEFFD2031

0x8D5AA8FB
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x44FCAD54

0x8D5AA8FB
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0xEAA0941B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Their father is dead?"
0x7671326D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x007DE54F

0x8D5AA8FB
"They have no mother?"
0x0F10ABA3

0x8D5AA8FB
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x758F7880

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x99E7864E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0x199C9F9A

0x8D5AA8FB
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x16B1928F
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0xABB62BDB
beggar."
0xAF606959

0x8D5AA8FB
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0xD3E203E6
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0xDF1579BC
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0x55487A30

0x8D5AA8FB
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x549FD8EC
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x684E04F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x39D8D7FE
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x978D7D09
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0x5210632C

0x8D5AA8FB
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x12AE6C9C

0x8D5AA8FB
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x31AE971C

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0x83517066
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x70E8D51D
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xD262A2B1
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0xE83B66A4
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x6454C572
to consider poverty a crime."
0x0993BD18

0x8D5AA8FB
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0xD2DD529B
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0xDF4BE89F
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0xB2D44C7A

0x8D5AA8FB
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x6F0A0A1B

0x8D5AA8FB
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0xAEE88E3A
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x1893FCDE

0x8D5AA8FB
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0x1CC1B07E
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0xF8A14E36
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x5422FCC9
the young people.
0x9569BFF4

0x8D5AA8FB
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x59D37436
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0xF0D576D6
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0xDEBBD075
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0xA85BB7AF
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x53558101
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x0AA93225
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0xAEE7DE56
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x5625CEE8
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0xF3324793
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x291A154A
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xE8BD2EC3
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0xC48E9DE6
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x4567792C
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0x5DE9CC4D
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xE6C123BB
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0xD9E020A4
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0xF13E673B
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x616BC8F3
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0x0FA3DAB4
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x14084C0C
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x4470D020
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x1046B182
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x48AEF076
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0x02BA301F
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x563C1D3B
for being united.
0xA9485163

0x8D5AA8FB
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x6E228B0E
ladies and their brother were now.
0x83E35171

0x8D5AA8FB
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x39E0BFD9
to tea."
0xD018E379

0x8D5AA8FB
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0x6FEC8D6A
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0xED4475B2
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x5C4539CF
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0x697B8BF3
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x4B8FFCA5

0x8D5AA8FB
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xFF8B3D00
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x2A4CD71B

0x8D5AA8FB
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x4219A991
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x5CA55FF4
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0xDC5A86D0
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0xFF4CDF97
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x4FDB4728
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xB1B5D1AC
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0xAAC2CD72
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x77EEBD0E
will.
0x65DA1008

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0xFFD78761
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0xD542A798
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x9F1D14D5
parlour."
0xEA294893

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am very well here."
0x51D82E04

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0xFC96184D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x1BBC7284

0x8D5AA8FB
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0xF747B916
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0x354FE336

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x3BFDC68E
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0xCD711BDF
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0xAB325AB7
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0x7405BF42

0x8D5AA8FB
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x3B994097
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0xE57136C9
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x701BB96C

0x8D5AA8FB
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x07642E9B
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0xDF3EED68
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x48871811
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x7AAEFE9D
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0xFA04AF9F
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x81E0E198
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x3A2C9532
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x24C45AFD
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x428E4B39
and well saved.
0x784F73D0

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x607E7D2F
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0x54ADD7E2
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x4943B2BB
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x4583F178
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x9AAEFD05
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x5DDA2F48
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x1B421C66
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0xAA038D12
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0xBDC72EBC
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x10E25214
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0xC5CA3B79
fair hair.
0xF1A19725

0x8D5AA8FB
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x3666DB8A
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x411BFF5C
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x2943E615
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xA1CA4BFC
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x3716A67A
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0xAE50AC06
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x8A47CF49
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0x3B4B7DC2
of the oven.
0xE0DF199A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0x2D427518
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x96B29EF0

0x8D5AA8FB
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0xC9862B93
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x5420F084
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0xB571C65C
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x1A031227
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x8DBD01AB
from the stranger.
0x4F46092F

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x3F69EB47

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xE52751EA
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x5C1BAA86

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0xE74EEFDF
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0xBAC37B9D
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x98AB7530
immoderately."
0x1996234A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0x370A1B91
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x2B7EAF71

0x8D5AA8FB
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x97674704
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0xDE8144A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xB8F5F6BE
absolutely without home and friends."
0x747A2F56

0x8D5AA8FB
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x2428D884
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0x38531E5D
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0xB8E88815
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0xB5187A79
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x13FCC0E7
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x3A3BFFE0
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x22684B5E
to encourage.
0x33A69AC7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0x70ED9994
every connection?"
0xDA5A83FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0xD41E8C2E
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x3360F58E

0x8D5AA8FB
"A most singular position at your age!"
0x269A99E0

0x8D5AA8FB
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x1FF460CC
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0x5D6A64D5
explained the quest.
0xE5A38E03

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0xABEFBB76

0x8D5AA8FB
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x48A00FDA
St. John," said she.
0x92EC9EEA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0xD938AF79

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x2BBFDD6E
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x822E10AD
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x1E06874E
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x8FDDC79F
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0xE9C5541B
out tears as well as colour.
0x6CA3F705

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x21567794

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0xA20AB110
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0xBF791682
piercing look.
0x043753D1

0x8D5AA8FB
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0xD903BB16
secret," I replied concisely.
0x40E74ED3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0xB0F2F364
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0xE3A53511

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xE294A9CD
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0xC76F80C7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0xCBE292B6
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0x3E532438
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x05136251

0x8D5AA8FB
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xADFC9CC0
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0xD0A34CD6
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0x9D35BD95

0x8D5AA8FB
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x77CFDFB3
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0xCEECF73E
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0xED919EA4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x4CEAC044
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0xD342F826
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0xF376194A
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0x5B89F097
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x2CAE452F
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0x7F0CC8BD
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xD917D45F
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0x411FDFFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x59E9558D
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0xF56EE6A3
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x2E2A05A3
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x98430A59
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x52032835
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x84E42AC1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xF4A7F5DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x7ACA2161
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x3B7F6C4E
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0xECF41834
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0xE1F61E06
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0x1F7CB37C
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0x256AF6AF
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x8AFEBD8C
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x37C919B4
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x62E29864
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0x16C092C1
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0x155EE315
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x12761E32
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x7F56BCBD
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x5271361D
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xAB171DCD
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x579B9A0C
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0x23C89C47
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x347AAD18
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x8497915F
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x4E898A74

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0x12FAD904
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x3D4277C5
down now, Miss Elliott."
0xC76268CB

0x8D5AA8FB
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x91C3E91C
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x69E96597
once.
0xAF07708E

0x8D5AA8FB
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x5D5E0B69

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0xFF492EF7
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xAE05C48F
sounds strange to me."
0x22B13AA6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your real name you will not give?"
0xF6DF10DD

0x8D5AA8FB
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0x770E5925
lead to it, I avoid."
0x5E067325

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x3BB0DB3D
be at peace a while."
0x484E799F

0x8D5AA8FB
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x24085835
and with as much acumen as ever.
0xBC26F54F

0x8D5AA8FB
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x65049E5A
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x4AA056AA
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x1BE50372
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0x17218B5A
us?"
0xE4089127

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0xAA3FEC11
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0xD8FBC513
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0xFE9F1320
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0xAE3E547F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x25346609
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0xC6FD19FE
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0xCCCB6C06

0x8D5AA8FB
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x6D98AE0F
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0x2DE411DA
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0xA19949E8
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0xE9F0D645
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0xD5248171
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0xE90A3CDF
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0xBAD48D77
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0xD090CF07

0x8D5AA8FB
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x7C1EB4D4
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x22B3B476
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0x6927BAC2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0x22736355
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0x5F07DF68

0x8D5AA8FB
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0xFF59B6EA
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x0CE6B953

0x8D5AA8FB
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0xD00AFB02
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x3F960BFE
present strength would permit.
0xF8E53EC7

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXX
0x009727D1

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x402CC50B
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x33C6B32A
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xBA2643DA
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x1E783137
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x509661D4
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0x49CECEA3
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x3E33FD94

0x8D5AA8FB
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x86934374
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x8837B4A7
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xA1FC48BA
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0xFF310038
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0xA218B914
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xC90A568A
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x6BE7FACE
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x527808D0
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0xB52A66CE
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x6FBE9B6B
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x61EE5E5F
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x2497122C
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0x40FF61C3
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x5D14481A
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x87C8ECA1
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x94772F55
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0x9F94576C
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0xB394820E
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x059EF30F
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x26E7118B
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x967F032A
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0xA3841421
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0x25CC04FA
that entranced theirs.
0x8E10DD51

0x8D5AA8FB
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x97E3C5EF
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xE1A4F31E
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x4212E0F8
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0xCA13DF12
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0xDF975014
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xE54A3AF2

0x8D5AA8FB
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0xE261D76D
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x18649C57
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0x466FC543
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x939E298C
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0xE38F0151
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x08DF372E
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x26F51B3B
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x80C4DA68
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xF2780F86
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x9D56FCEB
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x99ECED5D
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0xDD967633
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x69A63D5A
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x2AA18273
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xC796618D
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xB14FB0AF
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0x5DE9DC9F

0x8D5AA8FB
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0x2D55897B
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x3C66E9B8
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x6A0E832F
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x18D36CAE
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x94CDF10B

0x8D5AA8FB
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x81EC9004
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x89FB8A3F
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0xCA6D7F3A
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0xC9D4363F
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x9BFD9B0F
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x79AC114D
cheerful--
0x55303A6E

0x8D5AA8FB
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x20D17C91
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0xA3FF55BE
propose to myself?"
0x72664EEB

0x8D5AA8FB
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0xCE43BB02
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xADF212E2

0x8D5AA8FB
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x47924F40
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x9A536FA6
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0xFF67974D
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x093E1798
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0xD953F9C0
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x309721FE
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0xD4CD73BB
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xABB68C02
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x6DDCE597
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x71F5C278

0x8D5AA8FB
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xBD4E560A
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x03E58AF1
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0xB8F53EA7
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0xF699CD94
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x4839DE8F
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0xDA161C28
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0xEDEA5490
delights they could yield.
0x17032291

0x8D5AA8FB
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x9559455F
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0xEF35ADAE
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xEB392960
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x6D44018F
produced on me.
0x7E24047F

0x8D5AA8FB
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x0C9BE281
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x0190398E
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x83C07EE6
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0xE001995E
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x8CB26924
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0xA8A6E45D
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0xCF6BFC06
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0xF1E2BF0E
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xB5B2DBB0
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0xC55BD6EC
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x6D26F8A5
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x2B342C69
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x9FC5C6AA
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x64E2D09D
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0x35322F6C
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x865F2C20
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x4128F49E
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xBA289253
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xFABD1B23
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0xF30FD579

0x8D5AA8FB
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x322BA442
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0xA0E0F2F8
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x9FDBA1CB
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x990FD640
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x52316F9A
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0xFA65FC3C
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0xDF5E1509
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x223F7E26
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0xA405B72E
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xCBD5E621
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x51B29077
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0x16398177
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x41AAEE3E
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x779E1A57
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0xD952052D
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0xEFF6B5F1

0x8D5AA8FB
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x979092F1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x3AECE29B
myself to undertake?"
0x0F5927C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0xBE05AFFD
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x598BD10A
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0x5EF8FC64
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0xB94C9D00
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x2A6373A9

0x8D5AA8FB
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x9C65F567

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x6DD5A047
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x095D1715

0x8D5AA8FB
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0xBE72C940
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x6B9EA9C9
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x448DB16D
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0x4C730DC7
interest to me.
0x0421D528

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0xC85F23B2
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x9A902A1E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x4E737539
you to accept."
0x18B675E4

0x8D5AA8FB
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x2BD31A30
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0xF5B784CE
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0xEB69D00B
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x066ADC02

0x8D5AA8FB
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xC1065294
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0xDB1C129E
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x987CB137
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xA2282DF4
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x51D8F9A9
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x6F339221
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x4585952A
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xF71FF8B6
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x3717AF9B
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x70F8636B
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x6CA57055
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0xA7F31109
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0xA07405EF
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0xD7B0CE33
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x6E3C9B50

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x5DDEE2BF
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xB04CBA2A
glance.  He resumed--
0x985BAB60

0x8D5AA8FB
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x5E736CC2
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x5CE9F3FC
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x1586CE64
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x1B0BE09C
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x3F9CC082
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x20753EA9
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x9C9A726C
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x4234CCF4
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x8DA37C24
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xD4A9EFE2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0xDD4DED25

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x117B92CD
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0xCAB3A2DA
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x9080AFEE
succeeding observations.
0x98258A5C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0xDBF313B7
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x8AA6047E
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xDBD3290E
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0xDFA666E2
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x56F47144

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0xC6F87C2A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x3EFE06D7
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0xA3B85D10
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0xD6B72D67
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0x1CEEA9BB
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x5059077A
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0xF4545540
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x7841CFDD
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0xA8B1EDF2
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xCFF8F354
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x840E924B
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xBFD4D7A6
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0xE2CF3C69
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0xEBAC18F1
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x7689B451
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xCDB6B947
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0xD103F040
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0xE8C26FE3

0x8D5AA8FB
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x3A5ACA7D
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xB37AA3F7
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x1C7E7625
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x14777CAB
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xE5FE76D2
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0xB6B84D52
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x7EB4DDCC
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0xAEF48AC6
decision.
0x9505BCC9

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x3EA6B604
heart."
0x002F9789

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x1B8D5C36
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x1565AFD3
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0x846196B4
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x8448D752
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0xBFDB50C7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0xB12B5210

0x8D5AA8FB
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x7354D64A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do."
0x91D5560E

0x8D5AA8FB
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0x6412BE0B
deeply gratified.
0xCADDDB98

0x8D5AA8FB
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0x388B6897

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x1B83BD45
week."
0xDB4F518D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well: so be it."
0x839D6FD6

0x8D5AA8FB
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x3773D514
me.  He shook his head.
0xDC4CF831

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x590BA294

0x8D5AA8FB
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0xBA6C2E99

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x645222CA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0xA0A46248
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x11D8C72F

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am not ambitious."
0x5FA40D34

0x8D5AA8FB
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0xE1C687F7
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0xAA6DBC5E
it out?"
0x8B776714

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was speaking of myself."
0x84480AE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x60BF3EAA

0x8D5AA8FB
"What?"
0x15103705

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0xA4A8EB24
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xEC072FEA
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x1FE2AA29
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x54790173
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x2424358E
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x6B68DF9E
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x411CB615
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0xBAB1C80B
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0x5342C571
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0xA89D5311
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0x1BC70408
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xF4C273AC
some means."
0xE91E3EBB

0x8D5AA8FB
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x2F8CB3BA
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x8B8EB950

0x8D5AA8FB
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0xCF7B9B5A
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x503A1361
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0xA9E74BFB
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0xF5B76DD5
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0xD0363158
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0xA6E07193
parting for life.
0x5B413D67

0x8D5AA8FB
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0xB8F8F623
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x6ECBCF94
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0x9E247D93
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x7483002B
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x5568C46A
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x886FFA4B
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0xC8A33474
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0xF3DF5E7C

0x8D5AA8FB
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xF977DD49
she murmured.
0x1920F226

0x8D5AA8FB
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0xCC10DF91
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x5ED03349
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0x4D813061
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0xC64D49D0
letter.  He entered.
0x26A4910F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0xEE1CDBDD

0x8D5AA8FB
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x28D01C65
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x44DABCFC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x5C366467

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0x5601CA7E
demanded, in a low voice.
0x88D3F689

0x8D5AA8FB
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0xFFEDF33B
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0xCE510424

0x8D5AA8FB
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x10753A7D
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0x6DD08566
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0xC04CD8B6
enough.
0x9E1B2D77

0x8D5AA8FB
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0xF8E8ACF3

0x8D5AA8FB
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x769A21C2
Mary.
0x789616CA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x822D70E5
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x4C83851D
what _is_."
0x1B5CD1CB

0x8D5AA8FB
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x9A2C8B58

0x8D5AA8FB
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0x7646EBEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0xC7A01417
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x52E785F7
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x823DBA32
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0xDE160D6F
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x41E81AC0
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xCE632FE1
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0xF7A0F21B
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x924D5F8E
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xFAFCD76D
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0xF11285FD
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0xF3B68F19
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0xBC397B66
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x31ECC99C
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x731303D5
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x1F2AEB03
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x9349EA76
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x73BB074F
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0xAC687C73
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x8E58D9ED

0x8D5AA8FB
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x521FC50B
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0x1643AC82
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xE60F2AFA
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x090E2B8E
and so the old grange was abandoned.

CHAPTER XXXI
0x3454C068

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0xD52BA76C
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0xA93F5BBB
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x9A4ECD7E
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x0E1B1A86
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x6152FE6B
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x3997AC6F
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x2906AA86
things as are necessary.
0xAFB40060

0x8D5AA8FB
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x8FB9A4C5
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0xBD6ADF34
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x7D9EEF8A
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x5036B486
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x74F7989B
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x757874CB
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0x3F6DC6D2
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0xDB44C191
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0xC67B50CF
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0xE0107FFC
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xCB9C0B35
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0xAFC250F4
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x2AEC930C
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xD39FFBEC
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0x52C5867C
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x748E7504
on from day to day.
0x70E446A0

0x8D5AA8FB
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0x74A861C0
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x1EB08074
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0xF883F29F
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x68D9A8B8
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x51115E96
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x488078B2
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0x8A9C25B2
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x99F49350
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x9FE575F4
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x2C998896
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xFC72A0DD
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0xCCBDC68D
gratification for disgust.
0x06E40E06

0x8D5AA8FB
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xA3C7BEE2
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xB1ADD2F4
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x350D46E0
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x8E145A28
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0xB8EA0AD0
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xE482EC25
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x84CB782B
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x586B4418
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0x85E4C2ED
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0xB78E83B1
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0xBE4E3C9A
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x6AC9C06B
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0xC3BF87B8
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0xC1A323E5
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x3587EDF3
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0xFA7D8427

0x8D5AA8FB
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x837E48AA
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0x7312ECA4
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x03D37493

0x8D5AA8FB
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x0DD4B95C
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xA2508FE9
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0xD7FC11BC
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0x2393D39D

0x8D5AA8FB
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0x2195C033

0x8D5AA8FB
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x78835C94
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x1A444B94
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xEDFEA9C1
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0xC50D3D25
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0x43C0BE95
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x04D5ED1C
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x809B6E53
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xC8270142
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0xBABDCD1D
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x2E8DD34B
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x777AC809
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x442516E1
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0xFB413EC1
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x486008DC
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x0CA4E226
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x78846AF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0x840254B1
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0xE657B3F2

0x8D5AA8FB
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x6585490E
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x469CE353
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x51765C4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0xF7C3BF9F
asked.
0x8380DA33

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0xE45C8BFB
scholars very well."
0x1358ED3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x6F4960E9
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x0E5D5B35
I interrupted--
0xE754E533

0x8D5AA8FB
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x1A154ECF
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x1D03EF61
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x1FFB1992
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0x5D5D8093
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0x2C04766D
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0xFAA0C03F
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0xDC7B3803

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x0C9DE7F6
is dark and empty."
0xD072FD65

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0xE95E4764
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x61181985

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x85205488
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0xC4606D4F
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x146018B2
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x4CC11F7C
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0xF94F6323
steadily, for some months at least."
0x16353BC6

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0xB5383FD8

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0xCB6B1E1D
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xD1A3809D
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x303BD9BA
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xC634EA4F
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x8D07C3D1
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0x41729E7D
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0xC3EED2D0
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0xA79F0434
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x99520A17
rougher than it.
0x6EA58A08

0x8D5AA8FB
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x3012F745
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xA59A35F7
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x74BC5E50
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0xC3F9272E
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x5D60EE3F
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x51535BDD
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0xFA0402BE
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0xDB1DD40B
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0xA4FF2728
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x5726735E
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xF32B5F7D
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0xBE851D39
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x737BD851
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x5E4B3A7D
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x674C751C

0x8D5AA8FB
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x65217D58
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x7EED524D
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x6E843959
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x69CE9AA9
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x3C0453B4
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0xB94455B8
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x6A51D6B9
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0x7B4E7A29
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x04AFBA5F

0x8D5AA8FB
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x152DF50D
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x6CC1B048
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0xAC121148
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x2F70889D
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xDEE2AD18
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0xB13DA85F
exclaimed--
0x55167D79

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0xE6209FDB
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0xD8C42A5D
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xBFFB7134
your back towards me now."
0xCAFE9F8F

0x8D5AA8FB
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x8E06801F
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xFA896C93
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0xF878A96E
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0xC792AF86
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x8F2227C7
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0x0A3113A0
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x4D24905E
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0xECC5529F
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x6043BC75
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x72468BE2
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0xFA70B143
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xD07DCD32
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0xE716F3D8
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xFE2AB237
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x65D000C8
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x7DF6AF3A
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x191DAADC
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x748F766E
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x609BB010
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x40379404
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x27F44A01
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x5A5F03CB
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x143121EB
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x86EE800A
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x86AE4DD5
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0xE3D6E38E
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0x64F0324F

0x8D5AA8FB
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0x6EDCC59B
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x2B922DA3
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0x32C0F647
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x4EA1669B
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x5FA991DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0xFA70E806
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0xDF85A6FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0x33DF7956
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x6974C0AA
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0xAEEDAE3C
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x0F25DC23
pointing to me.
0x66322F28

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is," said St. John.
0x0DC082F4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0xA6165373
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x634624AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0xA8C50472

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0xA671529F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Quite."
0x6A6D6CCA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you like your house?"
0x4A166603

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very much."
0xA7119962

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0xBF61584A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x150CBAEB

0x8D5AA8FB
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x24BBEB1D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0xEAEB11BB
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0xD52107D8
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x2E194547
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0xB98E775A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xDA50D2E7
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x0134F0CE
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0xB9D9E591
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x79C84C9F
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0x9ECC1CB6
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x20B24059
merchants to shame."
0xAD4B4F0A

0x8D5AA8FB
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0xC580F14B
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x3F8CA73F
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0x754FE430
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xFD62D0B1
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x165FC50D
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0xB29CEFA3
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0xEDE159A1

0x8D5AA8FB
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x6992A7C5
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0xC72A4FB5
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xA9824E23

0x8D5AA8FB
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x41DC34C3
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x24969287
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0x08B136D9
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0x08C5DCFB
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x1522C2FC
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x6724F05F
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x30A7B899
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0xC34940C4
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0xFE1CFE20

0x8D5AA8FB
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0xC81F2626
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x46C1CF7A
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0xD41353C5

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x6D5459EF
John.
0xE24E9007

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x13D9D305
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x4715CAE2
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0x7F914DBC
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xDEC2786D
her own.
0x4C6434CB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xDC7F69AE
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0xF7846B5A
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0xBC1D84F1
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x303C75C6
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x2E1CFC46
papa."
0x0E5E7404

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0xC785F87C

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x72F19B56
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x01A94737

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0x015C8333
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x815F98A9

0x8D5AA8FB
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0xBCF4A4B3
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0xAD2D2B35
returned.
0xD1553F15

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x14767DFE
blanched as her gown.
0xE8FA415B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x9F365F1B
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x15C73D22
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x1E88BCA6
at all.
0x0120A5E6

0x8D5AA8FB
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0xA575AD94
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0xD5D0E4E1
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xA759E1FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0xD7AD8DE1
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0xEE4B3E68
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0xB5141BB6
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xEEBD1793
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x2D662F07
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x4F18533F
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0xEF3E4426
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x2822DCA1
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0xC4721C1C
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x2E2D46E7
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x40B0F0E8
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x181451AE
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0xE7FC6801
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x6E237F81
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xDCEF51D9
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x9D5B4676
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x11B4587A
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x1E8F5372
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x99A8B095
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x30D4CB2F
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x926763E3
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x8D439A6B
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x6413CCB8
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x30D076FE
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0xE5EEE362
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xCBF330D8
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x8FEEA37C
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0x4946C145
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xFC1A75C6
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x30B036E6

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x1ECA7EDF
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x4B0375FC
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x0CA29F3B
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0xE0A6B5CF
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0xE2821D5C
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0x6EBFB6A1
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0x5C9B6C17
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x1377E56B
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x0FC59331
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x00F0AB5C
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x5D6CA592
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0xF0080EA8
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x3AC69C4C
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x658B3139
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0xC85E6E29
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x0421BB2D
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0xEF21A33E
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x423D49D3
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0xEBB40EB1
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0x38B17C8D
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0xE3BECA87
duties of the day.
0x78653957

0x8D5AA8FB
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xF97C67DD
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x229A631E
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0xFEAF8066
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0xA5F78B02
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x172B9FED
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xB89DAF33
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x72A38633
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x81E31228
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x31D44A3D
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xB4758B1B
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x8F1C7967
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0xE424BE26
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x85B3D886
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x26632EDE
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0xB6766D7C
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0xD4D628AB

0x8D5AA8FB
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0xFC3C1CBF
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x277590EB
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0xA2B55E00
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x5FC9FC56
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0xB1477940
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x0A3DF7EA
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x47A8BD9F
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xE605DB77
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x592C3F4B

0x8D5AA8FB
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x18161110
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0xC9929786
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0xAD8345E7
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0x9EFDC938
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0x8FEF836B
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xDF146518
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0xC85D3FE0
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x5EEB8289
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0xA2B5114E
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0xCE14A45C
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0xBED4ED3C
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0x4F9A041B

0x8D5AA8FB
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x10BAC677
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x1659107D
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xE7CE8EA1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xC7CA9590
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x5D843DAB
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x3FB4EE09
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xB9DBEDC8
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0xA16C12AA
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0xB2EDC370
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0xCCD671BD
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0xE1DEE3E3
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xECCA96D5
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0xF1BCE395
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0xA5373977
acquaintance.
0xC5A94AFB

0x8D5AA8FB
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x26ABF19A
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x14B6E72E
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0xE1B5E6AB
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0x829FFEBE
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x97AB13FE
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0x3A3A5094

0x8D5AA8FB
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x667A6ACF
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0xC1CCF11C
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x0E404665
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0x8E15E62D
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0x503B62A8
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x08B4E675
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0xA3A49F18
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0xB4178EA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x136B39FD
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x49362C5D
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x9E4737F2

0x8D5AA8FB
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0xFB98793C
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0xF307F55C
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0xB4447141
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x7DF28A38
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x806F84F4
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0xB1478946
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x67CAF89C
day.
0x109AE0D2

0x8D5AA8FB
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xBE527825
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xE6E1D407
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0xDEA075DE
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0xC8CD3C3B
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x690E5CA2
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0xF1B4A191
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0xE12EE682
Hall.
0x71EEE587

0x8D5AA8FB
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0xA268EDEA
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0xF41D311A
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0xC9289E8A
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0xD9EC5E8F
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x34A8C022
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x7EBA4F72
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0xC1F6B154

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xF631125D
high family, papa."
0x941624BC

0x8D5AA8FB
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x306B791A
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xD2DD615D
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x797C1065
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0x7158B4AC
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xB97574C4
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x2A996458
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xF244259B
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x91FBEE99
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x69A04423
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x84AF4FB0
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x22F481F0
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xB479D038

0x8D5AA8FB
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0x42DB753A
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x31112C1C
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0xB32E5977
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x096FEF90
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x92B091A6

0x8D5AA8FB
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x0DC3A252
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x7136ADCA
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x81F5E8AC
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x2F2D1FFC
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x48847535
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x47DBABFC
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0x319F9AD9
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0xC34C13A3
Rivers.
0x532FDB03

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0x3425ECD6
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x8A7C3BCC
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0xACBA2948
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xC7F7FEB1
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0xC682F72E
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x86CC7684
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x7FE00FFB
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x1C4628DD
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xEDB93DC1
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0xDA33E830
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0xC5CD9F64
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x69B1BE53
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x23856D3B
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0x8427B15B
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0xB0EED56A
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0x846E5753

0x8D5AA8FB
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x65190DB8
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x304C6E29
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xF9F313C4
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x27B9798C
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x1CAF56B6
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0x4BF1A267
him some good, if I could.
0x9EF3A1B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0x8D690A9F
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x910EB851
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0x4240C4A7
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x8FA87381
him talk."
0x35D1CD0A

0x8D5AA8FB
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0xE226D237
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x7BFCDBC1
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0xFA0E10D1
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x82B48EBE
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x65BFCB21
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x6C322223

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0x1AC6BB89

0x8D5AA8FB
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0x2AF730EF

0x8D5AA8FB
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x4B567AED

0x8D5AA8FB
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x8024CC80
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xA69D5820
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0x80EBD8D1
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x9E6E0F29
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0x63A69737
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xEEFDE292

0x8D5AA8FB
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x02654BEB
graceful and correct drawing."
0xFAAE8986

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x57A74343
like?"
0xA2A81A87

0x8D5AA8FB
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0x033270CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x794079C9
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0xFF85D185
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x3C8F383C
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x7446DCB2
deem worthless."
0x5B14ADF2

0x8D5AA8FB
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0xDF5ED0C9
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0xBC7D3899
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0xD29D8B33
smiles!"
0xD4273C3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0xDEA8068E
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xEE22E53F
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x989F0F3C
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0xA856B6F6

0x8D5AA8FB
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0xC512303E
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x9538CDC5

0x8D5AA8FB
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0xEE83F496
or wise is another question."
0xF1FE506A

0x8D5AA8FB
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x7C4C1176
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0xF456B99D
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x8B432968
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x4ABEEC1E
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xAF86ED46
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x52115758
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0xC344384E

0x8D5AA8FB
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x8BE0D0EC
take to yourself the original at once."
0x9FBFA6F7

0x8D5AA8FB
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x49481018
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0xE6D7EEE1
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x0F8482D0
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0xDDCF3AF5
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xCCC80247
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x1E0A6588
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x1D4DFAA1
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x61FC0DCD
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x5E24D69C
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x3DB3F3D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x3B787667
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xB0329AF5
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x18C76633
ought to marry her."
0x4D190E6E

0x8D5AA8FB
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x81297577

0x8D5AA8FB
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x6500C3C9
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0xBA2F1423
often."
0xF2EF60D7

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0xB05CE1A9
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xF17D2009
the table to measure the time.
0x91038AD4

0x8D5AA8FB
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x6EA4341C
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x5B2F5885
fetter your heart?"
0xFD976E4A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x6F4E0AFB
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x9538A042
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0xF9B56654
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x8DEA80CE
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x3F6C6252
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0xF8206509
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x40E78018
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0xED9901F3
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x2279C231
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0xE37A9D23
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0x6D05865D
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x7C46CEC2
time I marked pass in peace."
0xD6FDB8BE

0x8D5AA8FB
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x7A9B52B8
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xB39F8D89
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x62D68E2F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0x0D6535B3
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x2BBD8C0B
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x31E18A71
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x3735AA6D
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x22D7EF76

0x8D5AA8FB
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x4026A9D0

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0xB03DABDA
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x63002F0C
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0x6370A42B
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0xFB327205
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x5936877C
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x97659379
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x53473A97

0x8D5AA8FB
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0xD6C59AC1

0x8D5AA8FB
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0xE0546189
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0xEFA4E11B
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xF323A9C6
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x920FC658
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x42F33451

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xC5673F02

0x8D5AA8FB
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x0B8CE2DC
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0xD1958F3E
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0xE2F89734
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0x3087B274
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x94E02E7F
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0x141B4562
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0x21D6376F
live for."
0x96245321

0x8D5AA8FB
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0xB9814835
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x7EF1B184

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x7F42926B
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0xADAC76C2
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x7EF922AF
should do."
0x765EC4AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0x2ACA1BF7
wasting away."
0xEC793B9B

0x8D5AA8FB
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x0F30AF7B
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0xD529F448
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x94C35BA3
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0x71A9DF42
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0xBFF177AC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0xDC208C9B
schoolroom."
0x975CA900

0x8D5AA8FB
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x1F1CD2BA
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0xDEFDFB1B
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0xD1420C14
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0xE84635C5
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0xAC6C0F42
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0xF112D437

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x14325A94
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0x3639550A
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xD64F4CC1
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x5633FB7F
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0xF5273152
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x219C063C
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x4C83ACD1
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x6146B8E1
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0xD0AF4140

0x8D5AA8FB
I smiled incredulously.
0x5DCE16FE

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0xB69D4633
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x906D67FB
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x22B0C191
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x29328385
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x30A94411
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0x50F6485B
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x4EA6BBEE
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0xD120FAB9
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x9DD5038C
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x185EDBF9
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x45748BBF
still suffer."
0x46857677

0x8D5AA8FB
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0xDD9FAC8C

0x8D5AA8FB
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x1557DB32
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x2B7E61B5
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0x7EAB94B2
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x561D5E83
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0xAF35BBC5
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0xB807EEAA
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x04A96546
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0x90958A82
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x40A0FF2C
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x8F2D6701
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x62975CF7
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0xF35390B4
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x24512C70
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0xCA057A61

0x8D5AA8FB
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0x586DBB0C
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0xA6FF1F72

0x8D5AA8FB
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0xCD72C71C
World, indeed!"
0xF85A144F

0x8D5AA8FB
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0xC9ADA94B

0x8D5AA8FB
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x58303660

0x8D5AA8FB
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x95F6624D
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x6857DA24
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x7A19B91C
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x771A62A6
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0x06953389
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x7D5F5B75
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x3BD4669F
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0x256E1912
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x94778D72

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0xB4D6C38E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x38071260
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x6FACD387
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x5CD9998E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0x584D1B7E
globe, however!"
0x662B9A6A

0x8D5AA8FB
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x48A5418C
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x24FFF7FD
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x30060AD1
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x92E91222
forgot it.
0x8E735A8F

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXXIII
0x6177DDF8

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x95CDF296
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x76BC96CF
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x235ECD61
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x68CF02A6
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x6CDB0BFF
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xB130C610
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0x92FFD8B8

0x8D5AA8FB
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0xC30FE281
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x5B6CB7E9
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x8F29104C
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0x9887EEF9
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x68D9887F
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x4399EBBF

0x8D5AA8FB
I soon forgot storm in music.
0xD83963A0

0x8D5AA8FB
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x740EF302
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xAB8EC167
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0x8B9C1754
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x2A8E1E77
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0x6E1D3E7A
vale that night.
0xB72A85BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x328F2FAF

0x8D5AA8FB
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0xA0D7C324
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x552302DC
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0x0FE19114
boots.
0x32C42216

0x8D5AA8FB
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0xA54D884D
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0xC29D2D03
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0x7CCA4AC0
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0x0D3EA3C4

0x8D5AA8FB
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0xED2305C7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0x811F80CD
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0xF9AC2359
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x2A6BDF2B
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x457B10E7
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x8F6EF03F

0x8D5AA8FB
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x4B6D4046
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x70797700
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x709003E9
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x5515F039
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0xC676DEB4
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0x81C4FBC3
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0xEFD31016
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xA2A77F48
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x38CC4388
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0x34406BFA
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x90578201

0x8D5AA8FB
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0xD8DA1867
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xD8CC6B9B
health."
0x860DAD24

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x1F62E172
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x9A8D59A8

0x8D5AA8FB
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xE2DFDBAE
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x26F0A2B6
silenced.
0xFAB75522

0x8D5AA8FB
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x8054C6F7
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0xF55FD676
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0xDB233DF8
was behind him.
0xB286A4EE

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0xF9F1E3F0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x70F51ED3
alone now, and return to my book."
0x4EB822CA

0x8D5AA8FB
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x3750C0C1
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0xC6E66E6C
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x30998956
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x7C210C96
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x620CEF94
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x579EFA0A
I would.
0xBC0D1A80

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x3F97530C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0xBE3A4670

0x8D5AA8FB
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xA5C75EF2
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xBC42FC5C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x8DEF7435
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x5004875F
and my scholars.
0xE0820CEE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x1CAF6350
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x3EF83F13
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x11A8E9E4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Indeed!"
0xEAE06C2F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x7E29A102

0x8D5AA8FB
"Does he?"
0x8E574E62

0x8D5AA8FB
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x6594E7FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I know."
0xFFA80D0C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Was it your suggestion?"
0xBA7BF073

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whose, then?"
0x1283816E

0x8D5AA8FB
"His daughter's, I think."
0xA04CDD09

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x4F6F6C26

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0xDEAE8DB7
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x47C80882

0x8D5AA8FB
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0xF86BDF32

0x8D5AA8FB
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xF7FE6A26

0x8D5AA8FB
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x7E9EFC54
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x0843E710
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0x649DEC5A
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x7C03DABC
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x171AA5CD
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x2F5C8E47
trite or novel, it is short.
0xEFB3FF3A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x924C3289
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x87A9FB64
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x19F75A81
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x6D08A735
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x52A62B38
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0xAC3E3888
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xA1A264B3
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0x1A63DFA1
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0xD19D256B
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0xDFAC21CA
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0x88D110DB
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x4B393DD7
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xE8EA9C1B
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xF35D1698
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0xE59780E3
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x3F0B276D
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x59CE1744
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x6F780964
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0xC60ADA62
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0xACC63048
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x119E563A
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x43E0D02B
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0xDE2E1DAD
Rochester."
0x3D55FB25

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x4E0D2133

0x8D5AA8FB
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0xC7AA1A81
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0xC8CA0547
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0x3D009559
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0xF84EEDAF
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0xA508B1B8
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x5BF8A6FC
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xA853E993
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0x82D037C6
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x8E19A60B
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x3A2189B6
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x0DF701DC
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x5FEBF7C5
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x69EF87DB
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x4C419FD8
odd tale?"
0x73E76789

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0xD90AD541
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x20E02E5B
doing?  Is he well?"
0x083D1843

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0x42D07E78
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x372BD7DC
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xC62DDA4F
which requires her appearance."
0x740E6271

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0xCE4EDAA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I suppose not."
0x2ECAF3F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"But they wrote to him?"
0x7D845E4C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course."
0x8EBB51BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x18DC6007

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0xBF84BE8A
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0xE8B4D532

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x879B4BCA
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xAC32A7FD
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0xC148BCDC
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0x2BBAA2B2
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x621F6B8E
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0x84D57E84

0x8D5AA8FB
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0xBAB37AA7

0x8D5AA8FB
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0xE9918C17
warmth.
0x91A2461E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x62BED233
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x0D9F93AC
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x35507C87
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x9A175A3F
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xB6F5F3E1

0x8D5AA8FB
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x08DA4917
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xD3715DDB
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x973A8E3B
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x4B064ED6
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0xFFB746A7
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x5BBF27F8
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0xA538D918

0x8D5AA8FB
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0x17604B6F
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xCF588993
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x6B1774F8
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x8A0CDFC1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x95DEB62B
Rochester than you do."
0x6529F38C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xCCD1A1F3
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0xA935A1E8
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x86CF075A
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x5316295D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, what did he want?"
0x91F89C89

0x8D5AA8FB
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0xD378DB48
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0xD1A40182
that--nothing more."
0xECCDBFC2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I!--rich?"
0xDAF2D038

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x38C35F39

0x8D5AA8FB
Silence succeeded.
0x9115703C

0x8D5AA8FB
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0xC771C270
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0x1B2712EC
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x1B959C9C
will and the necessary documents."
0xE104B554

0x8D5AA8FB
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x0980FBE5
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0xFEA34345
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x8962DB37
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x7745B38B
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0xF8D810FC
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x48C2C022
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x88D5BC1E
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0xF6B980A9
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x05E45ED3
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x6494545C

0x8D5AA8FB
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x9A37E310
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0xA6A730C7
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x0EF67471
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x592EF8CE
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0xED5CC725
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x948D3202
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0xE2147836

0x8D5AA8FB
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0x7F768C5A
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x7357E1FF
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x9E2927AD

0x8D5AA8FB
"How much am I worth?"
0x68766BCD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x7277703B
think they say--but what is that?"
0xFCA3A9F0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x2924964F

0x8D5AA8FB
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0xD26C3BBE
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0x1C02AA5F
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0xBC3A0C27

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x04447F4C
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xB60E7A7E

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0x39686E46

0x8D5AA8FB
"No mistake at all."
0xB84F9784

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x9ACF57C5

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x046A68BB

0x8D5AA8FB
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x03D60877
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x3E23CC01
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x933EB63D

0x8D5AA8FB
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0x732B614F
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0x912A7530
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x165A69D5
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x2AA5F681
Good-night."
0x010C2C30

0x8D5AA8FB
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x5F1E11C4
minute!" I cried.
0x776339D1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well?"
0x2FADD6BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x1BB63258
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x73259EB1
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xDFAC5063

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xBE0E0757
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0x0004A249

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0xFA6AB7C1
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x887D3C17
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0xFF4DBF26

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x9D03BF64
about it."
0x092BF099

0x8D5AA8FB
"Another time."
0xB0D360D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x0F09D19D
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x6E8D5745

0x8D5AA8FB
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0xDE4B2592

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would rather not just now."
0xCEF2BDB5

0x8D5AA8FB
"You shall!--you must!"
0xF0AB325A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0x4E137CB1

0x8D5AA8FB
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x1B29B485
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x5152B53E

0x8D5AA8FB
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0xC4EE8177
persuade."
0x474B4DDD

0x8D5AA8FB
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0xF6B1B9BE

0x8D5AA8FB
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0xB1EC101A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x03ADB95B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0xE67BB2D3
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0xDBC1F4AC
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0xB880230E
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0x754771FF
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0x83BE6D73

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0x47B4D48C
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0x1620630B
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x5FFCE357

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0x9CAF79F3

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xFA7219F9
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0x27A49505

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0xD4DDC7A2
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0xCA8AB1FA
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0x779323D1

0x8D5AA8FB
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0xA4A7B51C
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0x13C221B3
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x8C447058
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x640CBBAE
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x55DDF5B7
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xCF5A3877
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x75F3A943
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x71DC8DC7
explanation.
0x1FD21CA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0x08C0BD5F
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0xFDE809BB
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x06CC79F1
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x99F1EDCC
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0xD057B7E8
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x6EE4908D
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x0FB86909
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x457255BB
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x61457EA5
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0xA7D1F647
against the door.
0x7C3B9C2E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xB48BD83C
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0xD4FFE1DB
enough.  I resumed--
0x1D029EE6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x90A31D43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x93DEF60B

0x8D5AA8FB
He bowed.
0x1ABC3AEE

0x8D5AA8FB
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0x26FBFD6E
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0xB5848AEC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Undeniably."
0x54563FB1

0x8D5AA8FB
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x2EC4A9A3
the same source?"
0xB49E5E5D

0x8D5AA8FB
"We are cousins; yes."
0x274D6BB2

0x8D5AA8FB
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xE5946B19
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0xFB2926A7
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x9FBF3802
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xFBEB6F8E
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0x530C1B3A
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0xAFF1EA3D
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0xC7E2B8B4
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0xDFFDD5CB
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xD9ACCA3C
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0xE0F54076
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0xACA4D960
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0xD2B9C731
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0x30308571

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0xE489F52E

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0xB8C050F3
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x848BBCE4
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x0138FC0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x579AEB73
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0x07144ECF
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x8BB2018E
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0xE1185616

0x8D5AA8FB
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0x7C4E6B42
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x65E86F7E
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x13AEB880
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0xA0119ABA
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0xDF2245D2
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0xFEE8AB1C
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x12F78A39
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xE3C54448
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xBD15CCA3
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xFC0397A3
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x47C222BC
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0xA4122F6A
enjoyment.
0x99D307CE

0x8D5AA8FB
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x72138F69
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x2E9C5977
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0xE0B1CD55
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x29DA86F2
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0xCBE8B83F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xFFFE9B59
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0xBEA78446
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0x97AAA0A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0xE6E3CE6A
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0x98425462

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x76BE7114
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x05F6D3AD
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x51F5367A

0x8D5AA8FB
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x458C0191
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0xC10E5DBC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0x427F4474
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0xCDDF2274

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0xF31A6970
comprehend better."
0x857ED62F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0xEE9D1DAF
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x0A4EF490
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0x16EBD296
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0x86524FEE
fortune that has accrued to them."
0xE71AF3D6

0x8D5AA8FB
"To you, you mean."
0xB574579B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0x0F53BF08
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x35C9A029
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0x6503E504
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x1277F18D
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x39586892
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x2C5938EA
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x3F376896
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0x4993B0EC
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0xA3C0AF6E
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0x16A99298

0x8D5AA8FB
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x4A2DE1A6
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0xFF40A1D5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0xA9072624
the case?"
0xB701A452

0x8D5AA8FB
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0x948C43B5
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0xEEE61767
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0xE5513347
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0xAD3964F7
consider it absolutely your own."
0x8682DADC

0x8D5AA8FB
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0x6BB48A43
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xC6786EB3
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xD9CE00E0
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x95AEBDBB
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0xFF703E1F
myself lifelong friends."
0xEF5AB09A

0x8D5AA8FB
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xBACD4BEB
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x82AB9D7E
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0x312A7E13
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0xDFE22B85
you: you cannot--"
0xA49EA487

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0x08ACE925
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x04279C1C
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0xCE12D7AB
and own me, are you?"
0x45391E26

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x98CAF9DC
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0x34220A60

0x8D5AA8FB
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x63B181A9
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x1A0BA16F
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0xD4D0DD9A
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0xDE38FB58

0x8D5AA8FB
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0xD9E7C4E3
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x25D8071F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x25D7B5A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0x077FB6A1
excitement under which you labour."
0xB0FA0578

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0xC0B05402
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x3D47B8AD
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0xD17B60F5
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0xB151E6FB
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0x77E9C641
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0x38EC7A76
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0x2C3B67A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0x40F4CC80
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0xEFC17369
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0x00E464EA
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0xA6093C0A
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xD9768220
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0xF881534A
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0xD9C754BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x1C2BA15F
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0xE9B4EAB0
scruple."
0x7BB2B73B

0x8D5AA8FB
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x888BB5C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x98114F5F

0x8D5AA8FB
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x0A3B10CF

0x8D5AA8FB
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x873824A3
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x19BDDA35
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x55FC6DF7
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x189407C6
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x137435CD
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0x827E5928
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x9B14A216
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x76F799AB
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0xCCFDFD23
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x38AEED73
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
0x3E54D1D7

CHAPTER XXXIV
0xACC692F7

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x75521579
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0x1C48E8DD
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0x472645D8
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x98D22B58
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0x20F36DB1
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x0C2924EC
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0x2D5B68B1
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x779953CB
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0xDA3B1FDA
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x1CAFF086
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xF65ECEE4

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0xE1C69A33
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x337B38D2
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0x59D51E32
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x656BA26E
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0x1FDC5B12
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x51CB30EA
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x9575C65B
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0xDB10A2DA
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x9421049A
girls.
0x19E24272

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x9910717E
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0xA6FE9499
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x894E4E75

0x8D5AA8FB
"Doubtless."
0xCD2F02F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0xD892EEBC
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xE057D4F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0xCD9764EE
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0xC91B97B3
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x4BFFABEE
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x31D23DB3

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x9F30EC33
What are you going to do?"
0xD632DC6F

0x8D5AA8FB
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0x727654E4
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x0417E75F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you want her?"
0x8F3A037C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x9E35049D
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x5F65145D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x3F31D98F
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x78ED2E5B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x2826AFAF
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x60E5FCD3

0x8D5AA8FB
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x93F52631
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x7D810E6B
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0x5D191B6C
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x7B248D78
now?"
0x8676AAF2

0x8D5AA8FB
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x8171EAEA
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x5B3CB133
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0xA2ADBCB2
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0xC4DC7A64
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x10D71DA0
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x4CAB1DF2
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0x6B636F2B
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x0FFE0954
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x3D9A7CAE
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x7C16A57D
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0xDD8B0898
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0xD53740D1
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x580BF444
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0x40663DD7

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0x758EC1C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0xAB847083
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xE5E996B4
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0xC863C368

0x8D5AA8FB
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0xE7A02E49

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0xC4C47B41
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0x109889FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0x134B17EB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0x1BABFCB1
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0x19BAF46A
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x23328561
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x781001B1
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0xBFA6631D
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x4A81FDBE

0x8D5AA8FB
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x623D8488
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x582D5FF2
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x26CBFA94

0x8D5AA8FB
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0xE6E17C39
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xBC8A8C28
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0xAF8F882E
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0xB00D0422
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0xDE910244
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0xDBD01978
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x297960EB
hear, Jane?"
0x4E579D88

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xD2736733
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0xA54CAB43

0x8D5AA8FB
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x89166BC7
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x9A72064A
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x671D1857
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0x42F71227
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xE295CD54
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x21264CCD
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x98BCAFF8
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0xE0C6F523
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0xCC320BD5
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x8CE3F6EE
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0x47EEFBBB
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0xEDAEBA50
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0xE44FAE3E
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0xFC862383
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0x692171F6
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0xA1D671F2
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0xBC1FB0FA
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0x778D5583
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0xDC575845
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0x7B257AA6
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x70383229
without.
0xDCCC6BE6

0x8D5AA8FB
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x164C9441
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0xA52355F9
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0x0E483FFE

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0xC901A3C5
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x4FD05C3A
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xB4792504
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x8AB6D857
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0xAE4DE35A
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0x80EB6B30
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0xFE911D72
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0xF19A09A9
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0xF7D6E60B
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x0B13AAE1
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x7D5CB0F4
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x4516CF6A
improved aspect of his abode.
0x11424EF3

0x8D5AA8FB
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0xAFCAD35A
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0x2D6A26B4
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x18524895

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0xBB8BC6DA
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0x9521039F
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0x35DD21C0
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0xC5B2DDBB
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xB55380D2

0x8D5AA8FB
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x7A239A1C
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xD3812179

0x8D5AA8FB
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x3D6551D0
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0xD175A5E1
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x47DF7353
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0xBB43F26E
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0xFA938689
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0xCE48AB5F
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0xF1D3AF0D
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0x149501B7
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x3A303519
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x1D0D9621
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0x0B16A224
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x538C2109
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0xD5FBA39C
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x2899831E
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0x5598AB7D
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x744B3DD7
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0xBBC6EB1E
column, gloomy and out of place.
0xD780777F

0x8D5AA8FB
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0xEDFAAB01
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0x685C3D8B
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0xD1A8BD2D
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x60A65622
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0xE2F74D9E
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x48E667B0
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x417FE23C
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0xDDFCD0DF
career--I see it now."
0x32A86481

0x8D5AA8FB
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0xA2F19CD6
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x2CB2DDBF
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x084116E0
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x78FBDDC4
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x9F001208
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xDA1118EB
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x32F28F08
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x24D15DDC
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0xF4630CD9
into the house.
0x54FDD58E

0x8D5AA8FB
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0xA6116690
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x83318C16
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0xE466E721
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x4615E83A
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x12F88906
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xA5D3B521
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xDA8A6839
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x5A2E32B5

0x8D5AA8FB
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xEEFE605F
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x98C0982A
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xB5109169
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0xCD572022
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x4A36575C
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x2F972C4C
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0xA491152C

0x8D5AA8FB
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0x122BCD4E
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0xA363EDD2
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x38D54A25
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x538FA608
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x7F235185
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0xD14DD9A6
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0xD94F18DC
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0x876D07EA
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x9318E53D
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x68897609
mother, who was drawing away."
0x75394991

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xE2F62304

0x8D5AA8FB
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0xDB609B0C
the way."
0x6D23BD14

0x8D5AA8FB
"Tell him I will go."
0xDE4352C1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0xDD405535
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0x68C469B5
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x9D539B6B
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x272B8553

0x8D5AA8FB
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x06ED2852
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x6FB9B70D
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x182C3486
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xB51E9301
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x52086B68
with himself.
0xAD3303BC

0x8D5AA8FB
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0x407A1CBE
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x40285606
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x30C634FF
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x76F57CC1
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x49F46A38
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x06B1DEB2
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x8E0CD61D
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x4764B0E3
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0x7705F41E
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0xF9F60B74
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0x8EC30274

0x8D5AA8FB
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0xDAC50FA1
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0xCFDAA646

0x8D5AA8FB
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x1441018C
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0x072B876A
ensuing year.
0x9E39457A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x91126944
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0xF21E26AD
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0x1CB19858
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0xE7BD6074

0x8D5AA8FB
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0xF1F6F3E7
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x267C65A5
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0xC8E13760
yesterday."
0x96F913F7

0x8D5AA8FB
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x355D823A
he was serene as glass.
0xE278DDBC

0x8D5AA8FB
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0xDAC0B7BF
known each other long."
0x175A3784

0x8D5AA8FB
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x8079DAA7
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x47281206
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x58900CC9
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x6CBD4F6B
can he refitted for their reception."
0xAF70DC03

0x8D5AA8FB
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x718C46C7
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x6C46F46F
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x3D95DE09
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x506C6931
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0xF8239790
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x578E4CE5
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x43ECE144
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0xA1537B7F
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x4EC41597
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x5324945B
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x91924675
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0xBDF4DC75
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x34D89786
frigidity.
0x251DE4CB

0x8D5AA8FB
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0xD0F7FEAA
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x8695144D

0x8D5AA8FB
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0xDDBB0717

0x8D5AA8FB
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0xBAE2BD17
moment's hesitation I answered--
0x40016E97

0x8D5AA8FB
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x1A289D73
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x69D8C9CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x6EA08353
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x6B6FC266
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x8D4D5F5B
returned to his papers and his silence.
0xB0F65E4D

0x8D5AA8FB
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xFE87DC3B
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x019CDA58
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0xB46B3231
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x8C86DE7C
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x3C87870C
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0xDC0EB9F8
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x63A50EDD
plans.
0xFEF65253

0x8D5AA8FB
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0xA5424D55
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0x43D461AF
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x58B42469
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x3A06837E
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x570CC850
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0x1A5A1147
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x2F186399
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xA2F6C615
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x4BB8CEB8
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x82F6E0B2
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x68A5168C
the task without regard to the elements.
0x0C0B2EF5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xA8B86EA5
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x5D179E65
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0xE1FB8B54
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x4E203F75

0x8D5AA8FB
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x4A174443
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0xF59EF3BA
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x0C6DC92E
was a special annoyance.
0xBB53881B

0x8D5AA8FB
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0x006A17F4
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x777445AA
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x636AADAD
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x54E0F7FD
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x06C41FC8
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0xB76D4441
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0xE6201F81
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x16881D43

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0xB8D8CDB4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Learning German."
0x64AB71AA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0xA5D5E074

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are not in earnest?"
0x337BCE91

0x8D5AA8FB
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0xC0B7705F

0x8D5AA8FB
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0xFCA6CBF7
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x52E8CB2B
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x642CCAB1
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x0591C12F
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x176BD2D4
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xD5028C9F
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xF24F78FD
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0xEE31B56F
barely three months to his departure.
0x87EA789B

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x8DF1E45E
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0xD439D30E
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x9551491D
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x83994EBF
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0xE7794CB3
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xB351F95C

0x8D5AA8FB
"I know it."
0x067984C3

0x8D5AA8FB
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0x95EA2E58
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x12716E99
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x84159B78
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x222E6265
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x2AD12C65
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0xB2F470E5
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0xAC17113F
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x2ECCEA2D
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x7E30A236
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x7D72DCD9
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x49CDB68A
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0xC85411BA

0x8D5AA8FB
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xC94A2FF1
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0x0B3D387F
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x06621118
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x5CB7D4D6
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0xCC53B900

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0x19B38BE3
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x646332AB

0x8D5AA8FB
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x5CBD4998
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x51BA758F
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x2EE700F0
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x7EB4AABE
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x80F2FC7C
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0xDE6452E3
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0x549B6809
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x112188DE
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x2340E701
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0xC725FFB0
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x0BE84D67
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0xDCA31D8E

0x8D5AA8FB
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x430C9703
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x0EE0D0C0
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0xFD848D50
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x996043C9
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0xEE614FA7
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0xA3B80A9C
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x65837096
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0xF217921D
own.
0xC664A952

0x8D5AA8FB
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x4BDD52FF
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x29503936
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x6CDBF8C8

0x8D5AA8FB
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0xE7DA74F1
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0x91842D17
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0x3CA6CBE3
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x3F55F154
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0x101AEE12
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0xB252CD9C
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x20880A5D
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x66C797BA

0x8D5AA8FB
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x06A9A43E
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0xE6F08B97
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0xFF1C8ED1
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x62173178
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x4E534F53
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0xF6CF4A80
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x266BE949
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xFC1D849D
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x49D6A7B1

0x8D5AA8FB
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x9C6E15C2
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xE4D0B371
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x80722A0F
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0xAB6765BD
then I felt dark indeed.
0xF5953F4A

0x8D5AA8FB
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x0E181D31
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0xC0256768
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xAE5548D1
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x4BE6B1CC
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x41185A33
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x1F39A7A7
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x8D5D4FD6
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0x49FB5F07

0x8D5AA8FB
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x7AEDFDCB
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x22217326
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0x567DFF1E
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x04CB95DF
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x6AD84538
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x7386DB57
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x4D87756A
eyes filled again.
0x72F2BCDB

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0x0ACC8558
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0x8072B003
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x7FF5099E
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x90A729E5
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0xEFF10409
as to its cause; he only said--
0x0015BD2C

0x8D5AA8FB
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x08311A64
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0xB9C2E099
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x77E7095F
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0xE91378F7
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xB9960353
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0x513C9C67
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xA8A2FDAC
said--
0xE3981FA8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xB1D44A3E

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x5699C797

0x8D5AA8FB
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x0009EF61
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0x3D0C390D
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0xD610F069

0x8D5AA8FB
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0xD18298EB
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0x6AB3DB8E
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x82F559A0
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0x4952CF7C
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0xF0E5F640
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xC0A4AA4B
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0x948B5B17
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0x81D024D9

0x8D5AA8FB
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x128219FA
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x7CEB204E
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0x9BA7FE7B
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xCE91FD6E
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x3516A10E
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x2739950A
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x71C0DCB7
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x8139DA9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0xD0E68675
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x1D424055
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0xAB18311D
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0x6822858F
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0xBB62B1E4
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x65D4D8D3
last refuge for silence.
0x8BA0F1D0

0x8D5AA8FB
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x5A39C8B9
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x867EE507
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0xA1C924D7
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x2519A421
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0xDBE8ACBE

0x8D5AA8FB
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0x7C1E5DEF
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x3A051A57
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0x21C372FA

0x8D5AA8FB
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0x9EA48361
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x8D687793
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0x081DA5BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x4BB950F9
sails on the 20th of June."
0xB7C69DD9

0x8D5AA8FB
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x5F2A5C25

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x677E9BDB
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0xE06F0E34
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x490987C8
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0x589AD2B1
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x162191D7
same enterprise."
0x9FD61735

0x8D5AA8FB
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0xEC12ADA5
to march with the strong."
0x8E055BDE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x1BB0F57E
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0x7BDB9FBC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0x24DBC43B

0x8D5AA8FB
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0xA1BA020B
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x62F634CD
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0x478F87FC
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0x517F8BC3

0x8D5AA8FB
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0x87EE0A6D
the first to inform them of it?"
0xADFC8011

0x8D5AA8FB
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0x66877760
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0xF99F5B45
rivet the spell.
0xBC301613

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0x8CCCE974

0x8D5AA8FB
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0xCB5ACA53

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0x8A754094
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0x6C76427A

0x8D5AA8FB
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0x92F25E4E
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0xA12A7B36
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x12442A42
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0xD44E4668

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0x707C7643

0x8D5AA8FB
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x4C14B086
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0x21295A77

0x8D5AA8FB
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0xBD95F9FD
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0xF508D9CA
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x2AE8939A
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0xCAB26E67
service."
0x91C8BF9B

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0x5A0A688B

0x8D5AA8FB
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0xD5F6AB8D
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0xB114E707
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x3F8D89A8
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0xF463CDD2
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x5F1B95C9
for him.
0xE9979FFE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x4783EE62
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x4F4F4E39
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x69048F6B
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x4E118AA5
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x0AFD6141
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x1FB7A09A
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0xCA3F411F
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0xC89CF683
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0x9D62075A
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0xF6B8B7F9
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0x82F0EE65

0x8D5AA8FB
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0x97F49146
labours."
0xF3E1262A

0x8D5AA8FB
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0x77B7B9D7
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x92B5A3A5
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0x98634CA5
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0x79E78873

0x8D5AA8FB
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0xF8883240
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0x65956691
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0x5BC08632
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0x90FE46C1
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0xFCE41099
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0xC1F27826

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xD8D77B82
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x68E58151
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x7E629D83
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0xC5485096
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x89ADCCEC
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0xC4FB4773
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0xC891B93E
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x9E5E9FB4
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x8D836D8D
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0xF2D2E553
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xD8066F24
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x7B692C25
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0xA4B9A8D5
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0x54612C08
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x1C5971A4
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xB85FF351
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0x7AFEDF66
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0xB294774B
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x91038408
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0x6A34DE7B
be to me invaluable."
0xFB5CE54E

0x8D5AA8FB
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x7E66CAA5
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0xF1888DED
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0xB1F939C6
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0x3B4E6A7F
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0xECB1E228
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0xFE7E1C1C
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0xAA690298

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0x6C78DE22
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0xFC09F324

0x8D5AA8FB
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:
0x22BFA7ED

0x2CF6D0B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0xC77C037A
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x256BA1F4
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x3E24EF9B
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x6AF8DB61
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x699BABCE
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0xA1261A1E
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0xAA0C0C13
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x26ADF697
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x8BDB112F
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0xAEE019D8
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0xD3488A8A
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0xF376F259
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0xA8D536FA
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x01E516F1
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xBD0F2BB4
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x385064BE
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0xDE6D5FDD
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x88F0E2AE
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x1FED7AEB
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x5AD84808
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0xCAB12485
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x88BB09C6
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xC2FD9B91
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x8E7D8A9C
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0xC7E75EE1
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0xD43FB054

0x8D5AA8FB
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0x8A1D021B
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0xB7D4FC24
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x07691319
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0xA71B9562
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x8449D4BB
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x3C8F7A63
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xDEEDE380
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0x644C3E46
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0x04380AFD
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x5C51D134
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x89E5C1D9
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xD9097810
I will tell him so."
0x28DFAEFF

0x8D5AA8FB
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0xF82EAB13
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x64B7A73C
his feet and approached me.
0x9201D7E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0xFF870562

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0x3227F1FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0x87F4172B
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x8E461990

0x8D5AA8FB
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0xC824CC8C
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x9E3B62BB
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x52211581
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x723200BA
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x33E177D8
sense will guide you."
0x1C2A98B8

0x8D5AA8FB
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0xFB03D9D3
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x90EDB118
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0x27559740
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0xE823FA10
continue."
0x801BF400

0x8D5AA8FB
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0xBF9BE900
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0xA38109FE
have said that."
0x79E2EDB3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Conditionally."
0xFB776FDC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0xF914BB70
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0x0DD8F135
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0xAF3B769A
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0x027DFDE0
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x52DD96DF
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0xFDDC2E46
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x447D2C79
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x6E1DD95B
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x4BED8B33
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0xC148A0B3
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0x57DBDBB1

0x8D5AA8FB
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x84C7617F
my limbs.
0xAD0949A4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0x66AA683D

0x8D5AA8FB
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0xFAA078F1
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0x891D5F72
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0x2DE50E21

0x8D5AA8FB
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0xF1CD9DF9
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0x62BA7C5D
them he has no use: I retain them."
0x288C84AC

0x8D5AA8FB
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0xDAD7C01B
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x70A9D4EC
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x79EA3329
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0xB3249946

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0x6A375202

0x8D5AA8FB
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0x89A1B9FB
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x81C62BB6
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x935272FD
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x735AB6AC
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x34D3780B
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x7A181258
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0x4E7CFFE3
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x3876341C
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x39C8A6A7
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0xA217E38A
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0x40B7DCAE
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x0C9C8850
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0x1FB7FF8B

0x8D5AA8FB
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x262AD841
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x82C8E99F

0x8D5AA8FB
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x46EC0EBC
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x07A12CE7
this signify?"
0x0F9B7CEE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xC581675F
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x8AD56A90
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x7C5AD85B
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x50EA7A5E
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x78034E90
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x2AFC471E
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0xFAC5EFB4
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x63297741
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0x5DEDB0FF
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0xDD0C0E3A
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0xFE6F8B75
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xEED08138
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0xA08A4494

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0xC84B4F3C
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x2EA9325A
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xBCE24A82
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x27718079
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0x936F421B
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x4266084E
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0xE5F04DDF
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x3DEBD89D
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0xF3711A81
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x980B43A7
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0xCF54EE25
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xE10E56E8
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x289E5F1C
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x55CDA1A5
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x4DBCEE5C
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x9551F8CA
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x9B1009C8
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x1F6C9B89
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0x380E3A05
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x3E9CA45E
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x935E7A3E
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x71457E34

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0xD32D64F0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x513389AD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x4AA4D2FE
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0xD6559568

0x8D5AA8FB
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0x68B0397C
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x421CF79C
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x7000DDF0
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x7DE4ECA8
tribes--and unwed?"
0xA905DCE4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xCE766EB4
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0xE5FE360F
yourself."
0xD929C65D

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x024885DC
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x2087A89F
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x00DFA203
heart and--it would not do."
0xB19AED51

0x8D5AA8FB
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0x9CB85CCB
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0xA1957739
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0xC021B873
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x582EC53C
nothing more--don't fear."
0x5D25F545

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x3A50BD9B
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x658554F4
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x1F0DCF7E
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0x35CA640D
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xE2C14B2F
eyes."
0x6D8B4E83

0x8D5AA8FB
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x2CAD43AC
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0xC7106114
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0xE9CF2D1D
offer it."
0x1714BB93

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0xB0D455BC
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x769FF857
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0x54BC2176

0x8D5AA8FB
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0xE5FBEFE9
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x99037ABB

0x8D5AA8FB
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x998387C0

0x8D5AA8FB
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0xF315B8CE
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0xBC2940D9
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0x5CC2ECB2
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0xA1B8E5B0
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0xACEE8C19
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x5AE82F72

0x8D5AA8FB
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0xD27CEF8D
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x8D3137CC
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0xB1758FC2
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xB5090C3B
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0xB13B0590
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x47D3658D
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x0A39F21D
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xD36C9405
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xE898A876
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0x6086F3C2

0x8D5AA8FB
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x63C3C8A6

0x8D5AA8FB
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0xDFA12940

0x8D5AA8FB
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x6CA463B8
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0x58B92D7D
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x84C75652
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x679D2699
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xB1566176
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xA92EAAD8
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x910C8AC3
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0xA4FC33D1
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xF35E11B5

0x8D5AA8FB
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0xE8CE879A
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x51D57498
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x9177766B
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0x07D3C646

0x8D5AA8FB
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x7096F2BD
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x4F227193
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xB30D6B93

0x8D5AA8FB
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0xEEC17E7B
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0x4E534869
stairs.
0xFA3E0B19

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0xA04EBF04

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x048AEB5E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x5E7CC83D

0x8D5AA8FB
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x462F544E
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x11AB1616
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x305B7597
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0xA8CE465F
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0x962BEE6D
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0xF887E63F
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x83202DA0

0x8D5AA8FB
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0x3B43D7A6
down.
0xE3365536

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXXV
0x6543C449

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xA235D2EC
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0x7103CFC6
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x5C1BE25E
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0xB569BAFF
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x52C021E5
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x55F0C095

0x8D5AA8FB
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0xC88D2AFC
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0xC1EE2463
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x819155C3
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x8F7BA987
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x899172DD
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x116B53E9
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0xC1EB46BD
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0xC76946C5
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0xDB01497A

0x8D5AA8FB
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0xB5F5CB0D
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x6FF06D94
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x5D4634EF
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x5BB4A00B
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0xD9004604
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0xEE7E486D
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x1DDA6AA2
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0x1AF49823
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x152E37D5

0x8D5AA8FB
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0xD523D41B
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xAD94DD83
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0xC8EC2B0D
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x9A9720BA
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x04BF9E80
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x861354F1
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x26BD9838
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0x729E1F6D
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x1BC887D3
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x637D5FFE
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0xAD80CBBB
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0xC8C726B8
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x3D95E6A3
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x060DD450
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x57815A5C

0x8D5AA8FB
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0xDF87B4B4
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x2AA42FCD
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0xC1344A9B
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0xC4F690CA
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x606D6F34
spoke to the point at once.
0x8CACB553

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x12106736
friends."
0xEB985DC5

0x8D5AA8FB
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0x829D7BAD
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0xD5F1DC24

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0xF7C70835

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x6529E3A5
good."
0x57C01B00

0x8D5AA8FB
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0xBD5BD57B
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x4E5C2DFB
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0xFBAE1DAD
strangers."
0xB70859D9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x4389BED4
regarding you as a stranger."
0xF9386657

0x8D5AA8FB
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0xDC9C5917
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0xECBED959
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x931E2B5C
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x628879A6
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x4D326583
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x72893B90

0x8D5AA8FB
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x19EC77B4
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0xF9E8DE15

0x8D5AA8FB
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0xADEC2B68

0x8D5AA8FB
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x9D9C74FB
India?"
0xEB221E98

0x8D5AA8FB
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0x0851B068

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x768F5D6D

0x8D5AA8FB
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0xAB62C14D
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x380A041A
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x7FF1DED4

0x8D5AA8FB
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x47562ED7

0x8D5AA8FB
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0xB2BE91B4
crash down.
0x41786D60

0x8D5AA8FB
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x60589B12

0x8D5AA8FB
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x833720FD
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xEEDD7A9D
You are killing me now."
0x82DA60D6

0x8D5AA8FB
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x1D07FA79

0x8D5AA8FB
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0xA6A5CFBE
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x9D270B41
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0x79C95CD8
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x34D313FC
until seventy-and-seven times."
0x647C4426

0x8D5AA8FB
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0xB63EAAB9
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x7512456B
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0xDB542D61

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0x5074DA3A
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0xFE32CD69

0x8D5AA8FB
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0xE86EC375
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xD6978F0F
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x1C64180C

0x8D5AA8FB
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0x06FDEAC6
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0x3310DF90

0x8D5AA8FB
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0xAA56B1DE
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x72F8EB07
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xB2865B4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x0C01EA1E

0x8D5AA8FB
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x9A25B3B9
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x7188B685
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x2377248A
spoke at last.
0xE4BD7EC8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xE11865BD
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x0D601EB1
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x94868A43
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x21D1D341
sake."
0xAFD491FB

0x8D5AA8FB
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x270D6342
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x99516879
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x07C54468
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x5B03E009
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x981C1624
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x57AE331B

0x8D5AA8FB
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0xB5420B6F
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x80764D14

0x8D5AA8FB
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x8E726AC4
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0x536F3FB0
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x165F20F5
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0xD202F848
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0x0A5B96C4
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0x188902BB

0x8D5AA8FB
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xDB40EFE4
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x74797A7C
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0xDCE5EC14

0x8D5AA8FB
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0x27BF9892
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0xD9A7907C
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0xEA55E18D
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x5C5AC40D
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0x71997943

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x0BD3AEA7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x6DF582C2
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0x08577DFB
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x8A5B84A5
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0x4CE09821
leaving it."
0x6BD5FB49

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you mean?"
0x554E86BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x762049A9
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x5EDE9E14
some means that doubt is removed."
0xEBC98595

0x8D5AA8FB
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x43A0155A
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0xA226C586
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0x643315EE
Rochester?"
0x4A8FD8F5

0x8D5AA8FB
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xB3678F69

0x8D5AA8FB
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x09EC4AFD

0x8D5AA8FB
"I must find out what is become of him."
0x69E4D788

0x8D5AA8FB
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0xA599F3DA
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0x9BCCCF06
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x2885AF7D
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0xD7B1387B

0x8D5AA8FB
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0x3CDEE06A
was soon out of sight.
0xE98D8B7B

0x8D5AA8FB
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0x398FFDDE
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0xDA7FDEF9
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x31108515

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0xB9C296D6
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x55B03E00
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0xC6153021
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x5286B504
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x42E59BF9

0x8D5AA8FB
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xFCE731FD

0x8D5AA8FB
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0xD50A1AC4
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x5AC663BC
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0xEA97EE48
Jane?"
0xCD16E070

0x8D5AA8FB
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x583759AE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0x40E1C987
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0xAADD40D1
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x9569CA6D

0x8D5AA8FB
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0xEE5E941C

0x8D5AA8FB
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0xC5AFAF71
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x77A171C3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0x581C8C61
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x675096DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x99499F84

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x7AA98A34
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x06883956

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have refused to marry him--"
0xF5B2E66A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x0EF048DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x05F2088E
as his sister."
0x4AC996BC

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0xFA95BB29
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x8B2A4215
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xB3C95D7A
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xFEC1BF2B
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x6C3F60B8
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0xAA862789
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0xA6FA7955

0x8D5AA8FB
"Not as a husband."
0xD9B23B60

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0xE4603772

0x8D5AA8FB
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x82F03964

0x8D5AA8FB
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0xCB2A1F3A
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0x21031097
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x217F7FA2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0x4BA65BE5
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x28698A88
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x79C03777
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x0D213824
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xB708BD8B

0x8D5AA8FB
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0x70643669

0x8D5AA8FB
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x3ADD5A90
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x4BB087C9
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0x468E8274
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x1B15F8E5
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x8C237DC9
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x5BC55491

0x8D5AA8FB
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0x0A60D136

0x8D5AA8FB
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x7E765291
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x1FFF2C6C
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x889FC089
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x0075E1C9
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0xCE88F533
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x96FE86B8
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0x356742E1
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x580AD576

0x8D5AA8FB
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x291C4351

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x33414FED
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0xB4F3D84B
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0xA5B98F19
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0x7F4FA917
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x11017BE5

0x8D5AA8FB
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x6C3136A1
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x35638DC8
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x62806C18
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0xA15F3D26
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x4B8FE393
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0x07734AD2
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x3470BEEE
had forgiven me once more.
0xCB1511BD

0x8D5AA8FB
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0xE911862A
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0xE272559D
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x99870287
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x97A8D123
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0xD37BEE6D
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x3EC2FEED
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0xF72C5017
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x379579A1
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x5FCCB52F
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xA5627569
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x98C0995C
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0xFB9D8FAA
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0x695E9B0E
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0xE9BEE1B3

0x8D5AA8FB
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x9A5E1F60
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0xE09D4126
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0xD601FE20

0x8D5AA8FB
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x8E858EF0
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0xB49C2727
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x6E73134E
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x6F86AAC5

0x8D5AA8FB
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0x40AFE7AD

0x8D5AA8FB
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0x97DDA276
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0xA41A8F7D
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0xD2E631D1
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xFDFA5F96
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x3CFCFE93
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x5AF7F22F
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xDCC6E4F1

0x8D5AA8FB
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0x9CAD71EB
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x9C1ADC54
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x29F1E46A
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x57F424B4
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x63D11409
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x79404ECE
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x76BC9B14
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0xFB7FDA66
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x90B34100
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x057862A4
could not but feel it too.
0xBCC74786

0x8D5AA8FB
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x10E27607
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0xA1253563
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0xEB20550B
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0xBFA64D3C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x982CDFC0
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x80E637AE
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x7F1DDE40
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0xAFD45C7A
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x7197A388
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x23281E7A
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x1E533751
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x294A49DF
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0xD282A3FF
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xD24A4C7B
from you!"
0xAC3BCE8C

0x8D5AA8FB
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0x2B337675
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x50913797
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0xE3753986
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x64B54450
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0xAB6449C2
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x6BCE0D49
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xAC4BC501
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x03E1A8B9
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x1C2757F9
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x2F1B551A
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0x114CCBDC
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x3D59CD7A
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x4520B8CD
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x82738554
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x59DA156C
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0xCF91CD3F

0x8D5AA8FB
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0x8DE2C8E3
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x898E8C98
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0xE1EC29D8
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0xCFEC75AC
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0xF4CC0415
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xD17A80BC
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x72D888F7
dim room was full of visions.
0x14469254

0x8D5AA8FB
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0xECCCA287
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0xFCD58A79
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x2BC55EFB
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0xC113AE37
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x3113B69B
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xD6A9E4DA
prayer: it was only elevated.
0x647649C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0xC6A44E85
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x46F0D4F2
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0x352E1EFA

0x8D5AA8FB
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0xF8FC6170
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0xC55D5797
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0xC23B2BD1
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x50CB4683
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0xF31C5DDF
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x1EE7EE8B
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0xCE6D1379
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x78B01E53
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x233BEB34
shall judge.
0xF0DBCAFC

0x8D5AA8FB
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x1EB05787
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x76014C83
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0x53226BDA
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x99F77A4D
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x42100EC3
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x666FDAC5
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0xD79A28E1
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x97DABE8B
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x3BB44F4B
bones.
0x02DB78F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x8E1F0CAA
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0xAF0EF2BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x8BD421C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0xD24DEEFC

0x8D5AA8FB
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x1AB146A4
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x0B640419
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0xD1D9D940
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xAF3A1827
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x16DD673A
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x2D244DD2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x3A930AF6
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0xF33595D5
garden: it was void.
0x9A359F81

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0xE302BDAF

0x8D5AA8FB
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0xBF844D93
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0x1C625F6A
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x525B8BCB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0xC954A628
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xACE5AE07
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0xBD371359
best."
0xCA366B3D

0x8D5AA8FB
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0x113D304B
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0x52EFB48C
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x6EE3F0AC
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x7818D383
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0xFE543DC3
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0x7375A821
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0xFF7B27EE
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0xF8B2EEF9
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x00171AD3
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
0x261C0BC5

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXXVI
0xE686AF73

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0x0A8CB3FE
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x78AB1D97
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x9D2269A3
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0xAD3C1F97
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0x472259AA
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x9EC278F5

0x8D5AA8FB
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0xD4624110
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xD3DD7E15
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x7E5961B6
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x4DB7CA17
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x619A4C8E
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x61E2B564

0x8D5AA8FB
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x65FB8121
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x58282B94
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xA2238542
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x40D2BBA9
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xA0BEA28B

0x8D5AA8FB
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0x11B69EA8
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x5E05C338
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0xD51E524F
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0xDFB71177
would meet the coach.
0x98D1C3F1

0x8D5AA8FB
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x5C759A5B
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0x5CCF518E
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0xA1B52130

0x8D5AA8FB
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0xEBF365BA
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x2A6A00FF
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0xD51827B6
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0xC08BA7D4
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0xF301939B
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x3CBAF4B8
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x7F81A168
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x6BCA6035
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0x9B82E719
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x19C6EE68
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0xFEFBAABC
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0xD97A3ECF
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x3C3FFAD8
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0xC934FB56
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0xCEA750E5
body.
0xEBF4539D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x02870FBD
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x346ABD31
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x7700939A

0x8D5AA8FB
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x11E44260
and should be absent at least four days.
0xB5E585FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x150FA7AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x6E618418
time been uneasy."
0xEB261C38

0x8D5AA8FB
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0xD3145FB2
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x28D71287
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x312F329C
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xC18CEF10
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0x682AE144
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0xCA97E892

0x8D5AA8FB
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x1CE4F388
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0xB68B3476
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x7493F29C
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x767B4489
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x484A0348

0x8D5AA8FB
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x178E0112
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0xD4ACD402
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0xBB8B1080
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x7992EAC8
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0x509CF2D7
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0xB0CE077F
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0xBA3F9836
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x043FF169
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0xF32A273F

0x8D5AA8FB
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xE49DB850
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0xDFA85150
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0xFDFCBCAB
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x2683B325
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xE35A4171
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x16C6EBB0
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x864CA290
we were near my bourne.
0x6C9ABB64

0x8D5AA8FB
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xC85BF920

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x828E37BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x703F8A9E
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x98C76424
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0xC1488E5C
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x23EEFBBF
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x13CC5C77
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0xD4D03610

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x2D81814F
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0x04F8E4FB
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x1969F757
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0xD342C508
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0xA2D65EC3
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xBDA998B3
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0xC4FDF886
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0xD744CEA3

0x8D5AA8FB
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0xF01F23BC
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xE49A3125
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0xC6EBEFBE
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0x325485E7
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x854E223B
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xCEF636A5
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x77B9DE9E
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x8CE32861
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0xFDE74A13
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0xC6328FD6
them!
0x49E193AA

0x8D5AA8FB
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0xC8531F39
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x329C49FE
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0xFDEC7352
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x84325F74
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xA8EC32D0
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0xCCB5F5E8
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x84755F0C
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x754E894D
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x8989C1AA
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0xE5EFBD08
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0xD45D1340
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x893B39A8
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0x2D687ED5
tideless sea of the south."
0xEC2A3948

0x8D5AA8FB
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x012083E4
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x83AD7BDA
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x358EA8B8
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x8476A7D1
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x787B3AC2
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0xE9FDBAA5
station were at my command.
0x92DCA771

0x8D5AA8FB
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xAE5318CD
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x436E7A0F
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0xBE057E51
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0xFC36CE3C
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x5C7796D9
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0x8434A653
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x895AD55F
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0xAC1BAB22

0x8D5AA8FB
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x3074E6B0

0x8D5AA8FB
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x115DDBF7
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0x36D08720
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x7A060B53
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xDECA39D1
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0xCFFE76D9
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0xE982FCA0
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x05E840BC
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x007255F6
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x8B43188F
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0xD5C45B42
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x651FD949
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0xB52B048F
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0xC573F73D

0x8D5AA8FB
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0x20A0C35F
ruin.
0x7C7EBD45

0x8D5AA8FB
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x6570DEF4
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x8D302AD6
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x8BE84C31
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x8EEF1A43
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x9F711292
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x7ECFD49E
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x350916B2

0x8D5AA8FB
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x31E03B09
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x5EBA4364
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0xB75EBC17
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x52BFBA41
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xE2AA4115
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x183EF580
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0xAC1DAEAD
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x9DB80DFB
token.
0x065B6FF4

0x8D5AA8FB
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x40E7E7D5
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x738E399C
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0xCAE0E778
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0xF8F74F8C
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x122651F4
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x15AB6628
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x04D92CEA
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0xCE90CEBC
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x75D9796A
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x9BDE5B22

0x8D5AA8FB
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x6CF6F9C6
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x54CE3963
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0xFE6D6EA4
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0xB81CC6FE
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x9147E6BC
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x09C5CD41
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0xF55735CD

0x8D5AA8FB
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x5EE792C5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0x75327552

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0xB429E5CA

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0xEC78EE8D

0x8D5AA8FB
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x00CCA726
trying to evade.
0xEBE71F97

0x8D5AA8FB
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0xDF72A4E8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xBA9DBEBE
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x43E788BD
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0x7209CED2
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x3EA9365C
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0xD86D741D
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xDE5B5293
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0xA3C01CD6
Antipodes.
0x146C3C90

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x41DCF319
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x71D7CDAB
direct question as to where he really was.
0xD07F0AC6

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0xCBA2637A
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x8CBACF29
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0xA609E8D1
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0x905AFC4D
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xF9B8C202
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0xCBE9E7E9
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x6B52E14A
witnessed it myself."
0xC47E2349

0x8D5AA8FB
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x9341FA91
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x028EB68E

0x8D5AA8FB
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x14521B52
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0xCE1A1AAA
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0xD2A94FDC
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0x8330B1A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"I have heard something of it."
0x237DBC61

0x8D5AA8FB
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x426E76C7
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x02F3096E
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0x73FC1DBF
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0xC3BD21C1
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xF4D2A75F
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0x168F66AA

0x8D5AA8FB
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x07883918
main fact.
0xE3896406

0x8D5AA8FB
"And this lady?"
0x2A5080EC

0x8D5AA8FB
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0x4C8F2190
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xF11FE3FB
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x922E6DB6

0x8D5AA8FB
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x1F8148E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0xB6967493
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x80A6CC79
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0xABB3F506
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xE3ABA69D
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0xACA00DC2
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x6932DEF7
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0xD26B1F08
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0xD9C79D45
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0x7F57B878
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0xD5EF48FB

0x8D5AA8FB
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xEB89212C
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0xEC1815A8
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xDCC275A5

0x8D5AA8FB
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0xF6446D5D
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x0E9C8062
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0xA845E833
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0xF01D08F9
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x64058837
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0xA5CE7EC5
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0xE58BF214
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x925EFDB2
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x4E75D0D7
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x85C37F37
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xD65451BD
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xC75D63C8
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0xD346A483
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0x282F7F86
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x1CFC4261
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x5BFC5EE1
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x0C111F0F
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0xED6F1D61
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x64F7491D
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x16461B71
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0xD68C535B
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x7C975182
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x26666DC0
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0xD8199E05
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xDA4DA484
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0x2D900BD8

0x8D5AA8FB
"What! did he not leave England?"
0xA067E540

0x8D5AA8FB
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0xEF3D62EB
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0x2C396E8E
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x346F3B81
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0x1523FC5A
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x9B4C49C5
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x15FC019C
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x2B5C7E05
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0xB1D96710
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0x714D9369
Thornfield Hall."
0xFD14D348

0x8D5AA8FB
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xABB6DA5B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x42D8280C
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x61FFD8A2
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xE5BC1DA9
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x28A452AD
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x0052C931
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0x349F4AA0
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0xC542488B
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0xDC7804BD
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0xD133E663
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x1D1A9439
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x6BFD0BDA
pavement."
0xCBEE9804

0x8D5AA8FB
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0x284F624E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dead?"
0x9F549A96

0x8D5AA8FB
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x20171B88
scattered."
0x42FEE749

0x8D5AA8FB
"Good God!"
0xE3C461C6

0x8D5AA8FB
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0x6BA7A8DB

0x8D5AA8FB
He shuddered.
0x2E649838

0x8D5AA8FB
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0x8303B0FC

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0xC1270396
only some bits of walls standing now."
0x9BD99BE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x88BB30A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0x0EEB3AE5

0x8D5AA8FB
"What do you mean?"
0x554E86BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0xB669EE8B
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0x2482D529
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x0B554F20
pity him, for my part."
0x1B5DAC45

0x8D5AA8FB
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0xB1BD4C19

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0xB132CEE2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0x0E426662
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x6A7AB240

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0xA96E7EDD
fixture now."
0x88288343

0x8D5AA8FB
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0x10826072

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0x9B8407A4
Edward."
0x30C08650

0x8D5AA8FB
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0xB978209D
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x17636404

0x8D5AA8FB
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x545B8840
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0xB22D17A6
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0xDC3225D7
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x07F5C4E2
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0xE9ABA654
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x5DC1EF9E
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x6F05B603
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x312A62B7
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0xEEF60759

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0x990A8EC5

0x8D5AA8FB
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0xAA8A032F
quite a desolate spot."
0x7889C587

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who is with him?"
0x54436BFB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0x5572CA70
down, they say."
0x7CCE851E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0xFA0C7372

0x8D5AA8FB
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0x3B4259D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0xAC2D0181
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0x86A0F1B2
you usually demand."

0x8D5AA8FB
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x999B5CCB
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xD6FC252C
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x73435851
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0xA9395A51
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x4DBEC471
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0xEBB8154D
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x878BAE23
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x6D0CA071
there in the season to shoot.
0x35F748E9

0x8D5AA8FB
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0x42B0A1A5
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0xAF33937A
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0xAFE041F6
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0xC269E77B
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0x67441AB0
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x746CF4D6
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x5F312D04
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0xF92DF5EA
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x44FDE1C9
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0x36FEB90E
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xA6AC6231
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0xFD724EF6

0x8D5AA8FB
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0xDD81697F
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x3897D3D2
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x85B20864
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x69D832BB

0x8D5AA8FB
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x1BFD02E7
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0x0A376B9E
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0xC1277AAF
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x01096D3C
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x6F2F1029
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x45992610
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0xD80E6B5B
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0xA5CA760D
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0xA393A354
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x9E03CC9C
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0x4FB53D11
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0xDC7B13A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0x7E27E312

0x8D5AA8FB
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0xA1EEDA6C
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xA1F75216
grange.
0xC54D24CC

0x8D5AA8FB
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0xE9654139
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0xD04DC189
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0xB0B9C572
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x15D110FE

0x8D5AA8FB
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xBA4C0A2E
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x7F288769
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0xF13DA609
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x9DE362CB
advance.
0xB92EEFEF

0x8D5AA8FB
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0x0C8FCF17
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x9F3B2722
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0x63ABD07D
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0xE713623A
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x23C99B9E
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x73865E04
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x654475BC
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x1A697DBE

0x8D5AA8FB
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0xB2B58A1F
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x24392264
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x7174CA44
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x0E372D44

0x8D5AA8FB
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xF8FE1178
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0xA10A163B
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xFCF74C26
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0x0617DEC1
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x3B13E2EC
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0xA5DCB454
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0x5920506A
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x33CFFC11
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0xE38DEA89
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0xAB7067F7
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0xDD331BEF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xF71FDD08
had you not better go in?"
0xE358E1E3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0xAE01EF04

0x8D5AA8FB
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x5E396ABE
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0x67DB5E17
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0xF46F17D3

0x8D5AA8FB
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x180A67C1
"how are you?"
0x05DDA378

0x8D5AA8FB
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x8C4B9BFF
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0xC28028D8
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0xEB35FC38
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0xABA5F11E
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0xDD32987A
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x4438E0C0
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x1E0C9244
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x61FE69F2
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x051CDDC3
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x7AA24847
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0x6B01D698
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0xCEFFA8CF

0x8D5AA8FB
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xB8BCF011
to him, but do not give my name."
0xA1A570C2

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xD21F9277

0x8D5AA8FB
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x61FA0246
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0xB594EAE2
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x31595236

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0x4E7A090B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0xBEF8AC0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0x489FFF52

0x8D5AA8FB
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0xF9DC9693
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0xD774245A
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0x8BBAEF40

0x8D5AA8FB
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x3D07373C
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x7D6F05B0
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0xE444A523
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x770C63AA
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x01181EA5
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x0CA9552E
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x33F9F59A
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x141CB5A0
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x943C6EF3
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0xFCE2BA82

0x8D5AA8FB
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0x39951941

0x8D5AA8FB
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x4FA293AC
still excited.
0x53F550F1

0x8D5AA8FB
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0xE8252AC8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x588D2556
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x25575CFF
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x00C2435A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x805AD0A1

0x8D5AA8FB
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x821B2C74
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x6100548D
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0xF5B2E293
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x82A294F7
and aloud.
0x8D7916FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x5665858A
glass," I said.
0x38907B91

0x8D5AA8FB
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0x1654C98F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x72760218
evening," I answered.
0x65C3A41E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x2AE5241B
seized me?"
0xE305AB32

0x8D5AA8FB
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0xC4FC4515
your health too sound for frenzy."
0xCDD8927E

0x8D5AA8FB
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x22D20C3D
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0xFDF87D3D
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0xA69A98FA

0x8D5AA8FB
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x21AB23BD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x18978D8C
must be more of her."
0x6C28C4C7

0x8D5AA8FB
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0x7E59291B
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0xC3D2B905

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x0AEC306D

0x8D5AA8FB
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x54D30A75
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0xE467B13A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x597F342C

0x8D5AA8FB
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0x984642DE
come back to you."
0x068254B7

0x8D5AA8FB
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0x2140D3F4

0x8D5AA8FB
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0xE0176EC6
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x0DE3A189

0x8D5AA8FB
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0xFA65E0D5
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x4539BE0C
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0x8DE3E058
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x7BE94A2A
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x7F51E1CA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x477F0FDA

0x8D5AA8FB
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x916BD809
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x421B305C
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0xDA68A6CF
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xA2421D16
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0xF97C8528
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0x90051394

0x8D5AA8FB
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x08144810

0x8D5AA8FB
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x8EC0EC14
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xC356C258
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x8C4D86FA

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x707F0D7D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am."
0xCB35359A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0xA4EA86DC
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x0A19B766

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0x0E0FE5B2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x1ED0617B

0x8D5AA8FB
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0xC3A3851D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0xF2970134
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0xDBC94F48
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0xE4E161A9
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x765AE5A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0x2F2C8D5E
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0x13C296B0
company of an evening."
0x3959C6DA

0x8D5AA8FB
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xC95374BA
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0xA1376D92
me?"
0x601CE7DC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x45C4BCA6
mistress."
0xC13A747A

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you will stay with me?"
0xF3FB06C2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0xBDD239EF
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0x210D9EDE
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0xCC20C783
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x6FA9D04F
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x0CDB7462

0x8D5AA8FB
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xD02C812A
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xFC61A76A
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xA0E3A055
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x5A2E1E83
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x11469625
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xF2E8A82E
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x8C0AA032
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x00AEBBDB
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0xC61D4514
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x454383B1
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0xDEE24C39

0x8D5AA8FB
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x27D398E5
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x76A69C9B
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x6021709F
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0x67D0FFAC
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x1949C6B6
vengeance on its frame."
0xFDD75832

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0x6FB1BEB7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0xF74CD1B8
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x49E47BCD
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x0091BE21
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x0CE89499
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0xF31F1C76
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0x36D29778
Come--tell me."
0x9C129EB7

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x6A8B5103
you think it better."
0xA1ABFDBF

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x37C247F8
one day."
0xE5F40717

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't care about being married."
0x58B37C22

0x8D5AA8FB
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0x32E7D47F
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x4FE61810

0x8D5AA8FB
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x1B480233
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0x2D83D09D
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0xC786EBC6
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x027FB881
conversation.
0xAF53642A

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0x55D7D384
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0xA42ADAE6
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0xEE20C365
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xBB72739D
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0xFA43D8BD
not yet noticed."
0xE512D577

0x8D5AA8FB
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0xFA521763
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0x6D3F732F
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x908A754A

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0xE89FADE1
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x9A00759B
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xD0537B09

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x89DFB2FC
cicatrised visage."
0xF547515C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x380A5E4B
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x28BE0F40
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xBDCCAE45

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0xC1283BC7

0x8D5AA8FB
"And you see the candles?"
0x8E7E4B9B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xAA2A1A57

0x8D5AA8FB
"Can you see me?"
0x78A8CA4D

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0x9B4DC751

0x8D5AA8FB
"When do you take supper?"
0xF3923EC4

0x8D5AA8FB
"I never take supper."
0x0F6AA9C9

0x8D5AA8FB
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0xFDB58100
only you forget."
0x6C549040

0x8D5AA8FB
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0xF5C401A4
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xD266EDCD
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0xDB53F75A
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0xAF1A65AD
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xC1B86762
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x23EF2959
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0x9815DA34
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x734B67C5
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0x55887307
lineaments softened and warmed.
0x5BDF0E88

0x8D5AA8FB
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x22D8D6D9
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0xFB2F29FD
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x5846D5CE
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0xE9AADFF5
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x5ECD9B61
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0xFCE141FE
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0x94C1E5B0

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0x165B9802

0x8D5AA8FB
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0xF45921A7
p422.jpg}
0xE10DA93A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0x03F9060C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0xF6B73C3C
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0xCC516AE3
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x38313B52
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x2614F862

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0xA210F8AF

0x8D5AA8FB
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0x81CAE095
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x522C6D72
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x860E4E30
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0xE40DF532
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x28A24E57
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xBB5A7E11
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x4304A32A
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0xA2657728
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0xC76D0297

0x8D5AA8FB
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x0BCBCFA7
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x6A68278B
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0x3320A4A6
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x8E576549
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0x76F9C244

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0xBEDF56F5
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0x32FD28E5
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0xCBA9CC77
undiscoverable?
0x9098CE32

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0xC837FAB8

0x8D5AA8FB
"What for, Jane?"
0x6A9EE763

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0xFC666CD5
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x24DA1AA7
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x2538A85B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0xD68D882E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x9DA87D08

0x8D5AA8FB
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0x68DE815E
sojourned."
0x87189004

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0xA8E5AF48
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0xF5FD103F
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0x67D5351A

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0xA7602CCE

0x8D5AA8FB
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0x5898C1B0
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0xAEAB6A28
substantiality."
0x9C698F86

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x1BE11BDA

0x8D5AA8FB
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0x409AF220
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0xB03B8EF7
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x866EF892
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0xE16A8934
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0x632EEBC2
ham."
0xE9FAEBCD

0x8D5AA8FB
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0x94C8FFF2
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0x93D8179F
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0x7B583AC7
harp."
0xFB4840E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x07A70BB0
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xDAAA6BF5
night."
0x07C8914C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x26C4BF6A
been?"
0xCDB8B34A

0x8D5AA8FB
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0xA3441927
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0x4590B27C
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0xA5C1F5B5

0x8D5AA8FB
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x53139C8C
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x65EBA49D
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0x0074C69A
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0xEB20A1FD

0x8D5AA8FB
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x4A533873
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x3A6C466F
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0xB7F18151
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x28DD13FD
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0xD760DB6F
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x5D7F0A3E
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x5B29326A
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0xDF7ED7F0
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x36D8A5CE
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x2B91A494
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x27EDD064

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0xCD5039A4
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x9253D138
soon."
0xB129ECE9

0x8D5AA8FB
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x3D0E6024

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0xA5120125
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xCC883EE9
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x66A748C3
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x29A4ADA3
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0xDE82447C
can feel is in her presence."
0x7EBDB560

0x8D5AA8FB
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x52A0C335
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x335D1D70
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x5202F2A8
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x2BC56B6C

0x8D5AA8FB
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x7C1BD97E
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x758FEE37
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x263157FA
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x2223BBCD
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0xD166E5A4
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0x5AEA5D3F
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x0A8E9F1F
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x8E38173F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0xEBFE9992
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x5D62C3A3
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x49240825
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x60421E5D
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x7E4DF849
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x1754A3AC
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0xB861130C
she do?  Let me hear now."
0x9AAA282A

0x8D5AA8FB
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0xDC3FB3A2
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x0D9174C5
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0xD13EDEC1
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x13FE61BB
deeper than I wished.
0x24047091

0x8D5AA8FB
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x5690325A
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0xE2186E44
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x45515949
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x07C9D597
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x39FD3953
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x75DDBEC0
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0xAA391FEB
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0xAA3F4A0C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0xD8E5861C
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x66DF43F0
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x4EDBD4C9
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x19E19C34
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0x08D08053
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x6476342F
up.
0x58664AD1

0x8D5AA8FB
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0x53F3338D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0x8013A453

0x8D5AA8FB
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0x731742E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x01898F11
Or what does it mean?"
0x2241D506

0x8D5AA8FB
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0x1E7A0CDD

0x8D5AA8FB
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x2F4BBB77
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x92875550
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0xD60F87A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0x44986461
perform."
0x59197DE7

0x8D5AA8FB
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0xF0A55A7A
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0xD19107D1

0x8D5AA8FB
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0xCC7C67CB
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0xAFD23FCE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x04415012

0x8D5AA8FB
"Truly able."
0xF3B404B4

0x8D5AA8FB
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0x699AFE45

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x1F34A9BF

0x8D5AA8FB
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0xD9E45D46
parsonic?"
0x4AE11E28

0x8D5AA8FB
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0xC223C37F
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0xC4676AA0

0x8D5AA8FB
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x30D13834
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x5FE3ECCA
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x890C9A9E

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0xE70695B1
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0x9E2E3A30

0x8D5AA8FB
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0xBF7E6DAF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0xDB48055C

0x8D5AA8FB
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x3D3D5A78
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x3895B1A5
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x5D8F0D8C
immediately charm the snake.
0x26775F03

0x8D5AA8FB
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x7517E5E0
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0x2D0FD5B5

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0x654EB3B1

0x8D5AA8FB
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xD9DE46F0
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x1968375A
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x85D902CA
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x71B5482F
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x5C301BC7
bargain."
0xFAC46609

0x8D5AA8FB
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0x3C15317E
sir."
0x32A9D44F

0x8D5AA8FB
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0x33A1B4DD
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0xAA530EA1
question or two."  He paused.
0x8ABCC9D2

0x8D5AA8FB
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0x8781164F

0x8D5AA8FB
Then followed this cross-examination.
0xC49F8595

0x8D5AA8FB
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x217E6C47
cousin?"
0x90AD25E2

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0x5A8DCCD7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Daily."
0x21AEE5DB

0x8D5AA8FB
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0xC8821FDD
you are a talented creature!"
0x3561184F

0x8D5AA8FB
"He approved of them--yes."
0xFABBB836

0x8D5AA8FB
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0x6D1580C9
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0x5397749A

0x8D5AA8FB
"I don't know about that."
0xE63048EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0x45A6F073
there to see you?"
0x63CDA133

0x8D5AA8FB
"Now and then?"
0xCED85101

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of an evening?"
0xD6AC1A00

0x8D5AA8FB
"Once or twice."
0x9CDED114

0x8D5AA8FB
A pause.
0x1F6E2CFC

0x8D5AA8FB
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0xAB0E0C2F
was discovered?"
0x3D6F46DF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Five months."
0x12C8E1EB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0x7469BCA4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0xEF6C3851
window, and we by the table."
0x393B3725

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did he study much?"
0x63081150

0x8D5AA8FB
"A good deal."
0xDA88DA4F

0x8D5AA8FB
"What?"
0x15103705

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hindostanee."
0x7D38A4E9

0x8D5AA8FB
"And what did you do meantime?"
0xF5B5E9AE

0x8D5AA8FB
"I learnt German, at first."
0xBA58AC87

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did he teach you?"
0xC122A21B

0x8D5AA8FB
"He did not understand German."
0x3196893C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0xABE43096

0x8D5AA8FB
"A little Hindostanee."
0x1FE794BB

0x8D5AA8FB
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0x2087A84D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"And his sisters also?"
0x551E14CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only you?"
0xC7DD15E1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Only me."
0xAA72D567

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x4F7FAFF9

0x8D5AA8FB
"No."
0xB7B23A83

0x8D5AA8FB
"He wished to teach you?"
0x2075836C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes."
0x86A652D8

0x8D5AA8FB
A second pause.
0x50982E1E

0x8D5AA8FB
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0x8CCD13A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xDE5CAAAE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0xE16C31DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"He asked me to marry him."
0xEF14C0AE

0x8D5AA8FB
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0x55BE7DE4

0x8D5AA8FB
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0x98AF560F
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0xF857B5F3

0x8D5AA8FB
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0xA4ACDBC0
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0xA4547339
have given you notice to quit?"
0xBDA8D4A8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because I am comfortable there."
0x0963C070

0x8D5AA8FB
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0x1E5C3466
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0xE32185DB
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xD1C8F827
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x2F79B17A
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x8A2BF7A0
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0x08B470A9
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0xEAB0E2F8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0x907C8382
accord."
0x39C41F01

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0xE12320B3
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0x0A8C32A3
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0xD322CECF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Where must I go, sir?"
0xEE6C8826

0x8D5AA8FB
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0x4C62EAFD

0x8D5AA8FB
"Who is that?"
0x55F75467

0x8D5AA8FB
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0x8B2F09F6

0x8D5AA8FB
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x673C4AA9
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x86250101
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0xB9134D6B
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xE625391D
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x78B33CBE
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x4D882A3F
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0xCD7E6DC8
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0xE2839E96
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xBD8750F3

0x8D5AA8FB
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x318C60E7
beloved master.  He smiled.
0xC44E53A2

0x8D5AA8FB
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0xD0C2A0EA
you and Rivers?"
0x98AE1955

0x8D5AA8FB
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0xB0BB7103
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0xAFC50FBD
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x40B1D55F
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0xA63B0572
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xC27DF062
of me from your presence for ever."
0x74318C6A

0x8D5AA8FB
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0x6AD3B472

0x8D5AA8FB
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x7D9709C7

0x8D5AA8FB
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x39921261
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x045411E0
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x08AF7EDD
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0xE5CF4B8D

0x8D5AA8FB
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0x7A636532
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xA74CB10C
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0xC4F3094E

0x8D5AA8FB
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0xB0AF2662
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xC25CC38F
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0xBB303BC4
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x39F374B2
offers them so safe a prop."
0x58241AEF

0x8D5AA8FB
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x58C37364

0x8D5AA8FB
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0xC2AA97CE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0x002C9713
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x18CAA71C
helped me.
0x63ADCF0B

0x8D5AA8FB
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0x41AD0B54

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you, sir?"
0xD01C0AED

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0x580A501C

0x8D5AA8FB
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0xD84D0D07

0x8D5AA8FB
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0xA6B5C958

0x8D5AA8FB
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0xA262A1B9

0x8D5AA8FB
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0xCF9C7D08

0x8D5AA8FB
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x13DB69AB

0x8D5AA8FB
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x61F6B0A6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0x5E12AB74

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0xB7159EF9
on?"
0x1201E799

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x8D5AA8FB
"Truly, Jane?"
0x9111EB14

0x8D5AA8FB
"Most truly, sir."
0xF166F078

0x8D5AA8FB
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0x10BE655D

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0x0EAD4E91
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0xE9DC9A94
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0xD51F4E6E
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0x16B7D037

0x8D5AA8FB
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x8BC8BE14

0x8D5AA8FB
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0x9D66058F
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x07D5A30D
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0x2D0141C1
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x17AAB76F

0x8D5AA8FB
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0xCE15C7A1

0x8D5AA8FB
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0x691CBBEC
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x7EFBE689
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0x8199AC48

0x8D5AA8FB
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0x9EF58E85
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0xAFE303B0
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0xDC61EBC6
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x10FF9F0F
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0x98794C47
her?"
0xF480CF0E

0x8D5AA8FB
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x62EC5FA1

0x8D5AA8FB
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0x32106493
married instantly."
0x11076285

0x8D5AA8FB
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x5C0837A7

0x8D5AA8FB
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0x247D609B
licence to get--then we marry."
0x5E44B6E8

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0xC66524E3
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0x91873396
your watch."
0x3A606139

0x8D5AA8FB
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0x8FCB78BB
use for it."
0x99EB76BA

0x8D5AA8FB
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x74869084
hungry?"
0x2455D018

0x8D5AA8FB
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0xE29B98EC
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0xAA66E9E0

0x8D5AA8FB
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x7576689F
is quite hot."
0x3D733E27

0x8D5AA8FB
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0xEB90A2F6
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0xCD879EFB
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0xD23246EA

0x8D5AA8FB
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0x4037EFDD

0x8D5AA8FB
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0x871B65CF

0x8D5AA8FB
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x7C7ACF9A
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0xFA851C5D
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0x5932076C
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0x55CEAD2D
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x3FD7F94D
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xFD29CD63
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xB20AE8FD
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xA1EE74FB
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0x77C72B19
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0xBD23E077
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x09A41BD7
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0xB088571D
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0xB08C97E2
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0x983E1A3B
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0xEC3466A4

0x8D5AA8FB
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0x5B28B1BA
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x01BE870C
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0xA693F879
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0x43A416F1
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x5A3555D1
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0xD04C3721
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x4E1E6A4C
rejoining Jane.
0x395B5C30

0x8D5AA8FB
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0x7D438C78
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0x1E9C32B0
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x88C33D5B
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x86C0F228
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x859EBD2F
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0xDE7EFA3A
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0xE155574E
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0x1D2C5EE5
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0xFD0F90CA
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x084D7121

0x8D5AA8FB
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0xE7F1F122

0x8D5AA8FB
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0xCC244722
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0x38714717

0x8D5AA8FB
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0xF4E4B1D6

0x8D5AA8FB
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x0D95AD48
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0xA3BEFB86
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0x843D34F8
that I heard what I now relate.
0x888A639E

0x8D5AA8FB
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0xE7498280
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0xAAD269EF
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0xB8D1BCD8
are you?'
0xE176C5A0

0x8D5AA8FB
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x4505DF07
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0x634C46E0
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0x3A5AE6D8
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0x1F1F97F7
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x8FCCD9FD
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x03A27643
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xFBE2EB23
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x7E3B4258
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x4C43BE2C
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0x0ECFD6D3

0x8D5AA8FB
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xA6570ABD
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xF0087139
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0x4A683F89
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x6FBB4624
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xB9ED4A1A
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0x6C3C75F6
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0x802021CD
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x01378F9F
them in my heart.
0x858AB96F

0x8D5AA8FB
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xD3C3C3FC
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0xC04480C3
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x89B718AF
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x64D11D18
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0x9B504AFF
God!"
0x9B312D8A

0x8D5AA8FB
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0x7B11CB58
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x939E3D56
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x1C1A90E6

0x8D5AA8FB
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0x1DF39AF7
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0x9A2B630A
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0x5A843906

0x8D5AA8FB
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x3DA38325
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x1797FFF1
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0xEFAEE3B8
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
0x055A5BCB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x2939693E

0x8D5AA8FB

0x8D5AA8FB
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0xF4266471
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x6E69F143
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x8A06032D
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0xD13FC0DE

0x8D5AA8FB
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xB808BB74
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x4753092A
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x97C1A5DD
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x2046CC29
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x38275B0B
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x430051E6
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x5CE6787D
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0x7A95DA4A
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0xDEDF771A
again over the roast, said only--
0x768BF552

0x8D5AA8FB
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0xE3D5B18C

0x8D5AA8FB
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x06F495C1
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x2B6B9439
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xA747EDDC

0x8D5AA8FB
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0xBEB7B076
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x5FAADD0A
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x2FAE36D1
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x925E4E32
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x310DD0AE
politely pulled his forelock.
0x2F6CDCB7

0x8D5AA8FB
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0xBC77E87B
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x89CDC761
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xC4A8C2AF
caught the words--
0x8BE1B1F7

0x8D5AA8FB
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0xF77F8848
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x2384819E
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x2FF964C3

0x8D5AA8FB
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xBB57EA59
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0xF55A1E62
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0xE4B15753
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xB9522A79

0x8D5AA8FB
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0xAA3E9FB5
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x85CA54DD
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0xEA79B494
grave or mine."
0x6242C1AC

0x8D5AA8FB
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x0B0061A1
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0xE13C89BA
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0x91C35A3C
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xB120DF72
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x26752ED0
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x28A95922
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0xB065663B

0x8D5AA8FB
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0xAE5F1209
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0x1F823E43
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xC8646679
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x51181B8D
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x37D7040D
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x1D3DBC14
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0xD9EFF306
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0xF8E9CA99
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0xE6E462C4
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x2B62E74B
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x3A5A904E
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x23FFE7BB
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xB2E8C0B8
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0xD6A872E4
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x2777DD7C
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0xB0C846AC
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x6D3710C9
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0x84674285

0x8D5AA8FB
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x3E730739
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0x50D05606
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x4D56CD71

0x8D5AA8FB
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x8626EE7D
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0xBC30FC02
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x91CCF074
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xD352B94A
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x57A31850
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x42F1B0B2
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xC6794F14
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xDA391C69
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0xDB9EAF55
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x43F75AA0
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x8D8AD22D
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x32286B5A
concord is the result.
0x9F6ACAB1

0x8D5AA8FB
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x444ACE36
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x6382C25F
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x19823B48
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0xA0599274
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0xB8B23837
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xD5D99DE8
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x0A049158
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0x98A5166F
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xB3FC1855
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x69E2A591
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xE217BD65
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x3F315429
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x4C597D07
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x88CDD622
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0x60F6BDC0

0x8D5AA8FB
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0xB457F528
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0x2C43D40C
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x7A4B71C4

0x8D5AA8FB
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0xA0993AF7

0x8D5AA8FB
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0x66ADCD82

0x8D5AA8FB
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0xEEEC7153

0x8D5AA8FB
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0x78EB31A5
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0xE7D343B9
sure of it.
0x29E64A7B

0x8D5AA8FB
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0xAA0895AC
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x6DE20E93
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0xA767F91E
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0xC50FC495
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xE3FC8322
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xFB7CEEA1
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x43EDF55E
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0xB7DC7AE5

0x8D5AA8FB
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x76D4A4D6
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0xB2F3145F
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x66F17F06
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x8DCB763E
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0xDE81CAC0
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x2D69711D
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0xF17E78B1

0x8D5AA8FB
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0xBF369CEB
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x123FF25B
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x0B32692C
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0xB84E37F2
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x07DB5628
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0xFB395AC7
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0xEADFE56B
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x0BAB2E51
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x070C254B
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0x5792CF68
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x8722D1B4
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x49E63ABC
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0xA6D5BDA2
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xF39CC80F
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x361A32E2

0x8D5AA8FB
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x985FD149
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x0518A9B5
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x6724AEE2
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x38D92566
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xBB5264AD
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0xB8E78617
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x30E10E48
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0xC80CDE19
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x79FE07E7
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0x7941FD45

0x8D5AA8FB
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x92C82BF8
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0xF9C4CEB1
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

0x3D42FAF1

0x8D5AA8FB
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x6E099DE7
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x1A76D0E5
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0x4BFBF68A
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x2C665BAD
people in all walks of life.
0xD471A724

0x8D5AA8FB
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0xFA9D5C54
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0xF6426B48
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0xD1E92CCC
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0x6F4ABE1C
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0x3EB35A2D
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation
0xAF219753

0x8D5AA8FB
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0x15E97F5F
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0x070BB60C
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0x66FE6A02
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0x174EE3EC
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0x6A252297
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0x7696E46C
status with the IRS.
0x8CC4FBA2

0x8D5AA8FB
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0x41C9CFBC
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0xB431F993
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0xF63D5813
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0xE314B47E
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0xB5DBA6A0
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
0x10050AD6
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
0xB168CA3C
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
0xF3DF0E35

0x8D5AA8FB
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
0x0613B9A0
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0xFF43D902
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0x9C16B8F0
approach us with offers to donate.
0xD8BB74D1

0x8D5AA8FB
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
0x3D0E5A51
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
0xBE414E4C
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
0x232362CB
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0xA3DF6922
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
0x754C0413
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0x14F26BA8

0x8D5AA8FB
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0x0D95F221
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0xE06761C7
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
0xD141BC9E
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
