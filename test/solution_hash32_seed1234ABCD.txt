PREFACE
0xE7F19109

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x73C89195
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x963188D7
miscellaneous remark.
0xBA3E04BC

0x51EF4E84
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0xADB79769

0x51EF4E84
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x4C8966B4
few pretensions.
0xD0AB4AFB

0x51EF4E84
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0xDA3ECA73
obscure aspirant.
0xBC0BCDD9

0x51EF4E84
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x4CB2691D
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x329B5CA4
Author.
0xA971CEC4

0x51EF4E84
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0xCA5B6E3D
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x48A10942
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xD6C5F531
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x3E1AF135
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x5CC94E39
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0xA050ED0C

0x51EF4E84
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x10D77AD5
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0xF27A7369
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0xE35B3948
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x23407FAB
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0xE25094C9
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0xE7A0DD54
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x95058554
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0x170FD1D8

0x51EF4E84
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0xEB2C410D
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x97B49095
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x8049DB05
Thorns.
0xA98037F5

0x51EF4E84
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0x259CA9BF
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0xF2CEAEB9
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0xB95F805F
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xF7F10558
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0x99B654D6
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xD500FCBC
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x7CC08262

0x51EF4E84
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0xF15CA80D
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0xF8656C5B
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0x1D055E90
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x699D2E63
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x80EC312B
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0xC467263C

0x51EF4E84
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0xA3A0E036
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x640257E5
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0x6C7D255F
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x2E345AE6

0x51EF4E84
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x5A6C56EB
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x29CFB9D9
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x09C14EAC
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x43D5ABE2
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x797DD4A6
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x51217298
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x546BE60B
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0xAFCE5572
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x3AF1D1CA
Rimoth-Gilead.
0x38A7623D

0x51EF4E84
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x645F5152
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x5F3AFD58
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0x7235B6C1
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xA92F3065
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x5643E49E
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0x39515970
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0x061B3492
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x72014BA6
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x10204291
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x5A20E954
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xCCB00230
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0xC1D48DAF
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0xC895BFA6
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xA14DEC1E
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0x5C21082F

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0xF6829282
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0xAF9A44EB
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x656D08AA
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xBC30BA64
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0x7B1EC618
denied where it is justly due.
0x0EF16AE2

0x51EF4E84
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0xE2971643
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0x61C5CA48

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0xE3A699ED
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x9153D03C
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x4A438945
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0x78DDBE19
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xE4BD07DB

0x51EF4E84
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xAF237D6A
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x6AA4E072
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0x831D409F
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x058EE1FA
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0x4E41811C

0x51EF4E84
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x34E75E59
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xB6AE5D7A
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x3FD1E09A
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x91530713
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0xAE7A0451
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xBCB69152
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x17A93F23
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0xF39AF0A4
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0xFF6696D4
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0xDEE06728
little children."
0xBA3066DF

0x51EF4E84
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x458556B7

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x26BD38A3
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0xADCBC738
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0x22BDED28

0x51EF4E84
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x7FB08233
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0x9473D6CB
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x9DB40CD8
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x2E4F6FD4
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xA3749DA5
retirement.
0xF83B6432

0x51EF4E84
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x43B3DCA1
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x3D974330
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xED3BB40C
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xF8C32FD1
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x83D66D47
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0xEEB42BBF
lamentable blast.
0x0C24A060

0x51EF4E84
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x580DE6DA
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x1904D01B
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0xDB75AE5C
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x423D1DB0
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x2A5B0CA9
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x0D954B74
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0xEAEFFB98

0x51EF4E84
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0xD675C7FE
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x35BFFA75
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0x67D04EF2
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x8FFDBB87

0x51EF4E84
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0x01B8817E
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0xDF31FBC0
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x9F20A27D
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x5EAA3D06
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x01A0D828
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x82D3744E
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0xA02508D9
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x55401FD2
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0xD326C5C8
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x94A9A203
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x28D5A52C
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x097B4D51
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x43904218

0x51EF4E84
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0xFD7A4420
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0xEE831B15
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0xD805D7EB
hour of eventide.
0x9DC5B6B0

0x51EF4E84
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0xD1B77246

0x51EF4E84
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x6AEBF731
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0xD31D7DCC

0x51EF4E84
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x40C9A711
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x7AB8AD22

0x51EF4E84
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x5C8FB8EF
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x36E26F2C
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x456336ED
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x955ADE5E
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0xFAE9966C
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0xD4128602
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xD77E086D
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0xB761C472
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0xF516BA86

0x51EF4E84
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x39847156
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x3ECC348C
room door opened.
0x4698065C

0x51EF4E84
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0x9A99FB02
found the room apparently empty.
0x296DD8A3

0x51EF4E84
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x472AB3D0
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x6A3FEC9C
animal!"
0x83171E0E

0x51EF4E84
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x6AB4C5E5
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0xE4F4AF49
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x22B2E52D
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x55FBE336

0x51EF4E84
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x6D37E7E9

0x51EF4E84
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x3182BFB3
forth by the said Jack.
0x0BF28133

0x51EF4E84
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x4324BABA

0x51EF4E84
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xC8BCD9C1
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0xE17968B0
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0x2412C9D5

0x51EF4E84
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0xCD46A998
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0xA0FB368C
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0x76368EC5
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x173E71D9
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x9924C6B7
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x3EEFD166
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x600319CF
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x28D1D880
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0xE4571FF7
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xF7AF3217
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0xD5C226CC
home.
0xA8CD9767

0x51EF4E84
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x925BD60A
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0x4FF848F5
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0xC920C326
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0xB3826362
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x2202EAFC
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xAEEFF08C
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0x9ECEA5EE
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x543A136F
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0xCF81B447
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x364602A2
her back.
0xB99C1E34

0x51EF4E84
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0xECDC841F
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0xDA42A71A
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x4B555949
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x633B0C24
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0xDDB7F179
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x8678C8FF
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x592D3928
chair.
0xD034EBFE

0x51EF4E84
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x14493E0F
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x5565021C
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x2E1F2BF6

0x51EF4E84
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0xEADEAD59
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x2A2F5F9C
insult.
0x76D26528

0x51EF4E84
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0xB310FBEB

0x51EF4E84
"I was reading."
0x2DC9CB7E

0x51EF4E84
"Show the book."
0x3F39C92D

0x51EF4E84
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.

"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x6B113559
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0x34173742
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0x5C6838ED
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0xCF3AAD97
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xDAE210FD
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0xE7055707
the mirror and the windows."
0x817F9F78

0x51EF4E84
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xF74159D7
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x2F571C95
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x3BA26DA4
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0xD09F7879
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0xE6BE0CF7
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x5C3AC157

0x51EF4E84
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x58A2AADA
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x7A24E326

0x51EF4E84
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x59826242
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x3AC59213
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0xC065A3BD

0x51EF4E84
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0xB62F8E2C
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xDCDA4ABC

0x51EF4E84
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0xC30ADA5F
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x90475E62
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0xB68626E9
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x02C48595
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0xB0B189F9
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0x2C0FBE8C
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x71B158B7
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xF1B5AD93
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0xC684FE32

0x51EF4E84
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0x139228D5

0x51EF4E84
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0xDC76E218

0x51EF4E84
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x81D28E36

0x51EF4E84
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0xDDF3CC88
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER II
0x6C041912

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0x93224421
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x9682CD47
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x460F8677
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x90D55D31
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x6C170FD5
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x3D9427E4

0x51EF4E84
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0xB0137F60

0x51EF4E84
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0xF918FDCC
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0xACE62F7B
young master."
0x62C68386

0x51EF4E84
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x1285FFE9

0x51EF4E84
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x661D03DE
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x588C4E6F

0x51EF4E84
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x72498098
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0x499239FA
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0xF2F223F1

0x51EF4E84
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0xA0B91906
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0xEA821038

0x51EF4E84
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x3D5897FD
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x5D8B2AD9
little of the excitement out of me.
0x69DA44C9

0x51EF4E84
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x1AECD385

0x51EF4E84
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x69AC449C

0x51EF4E84
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0x67879BB3
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0x61BBD554
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xA7D0F347
incredulous of my sanity.
0xF3564DF7

0x51EF4E84
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x2BB4A55F

0x51EF4E84
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x4B931861
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x42355152
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0x1DA369BE

0x51EF4E84
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0x0C417DE7
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xF264456F
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x4FBF84DC

0x51EF4E84
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0xDC920AAF
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xFF503CF8
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0xB7F76DB3
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x3269CA4A

0x51EF4E84
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x363B50E7
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x6DD26887
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x8854B2B1
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x8352966C
them."
0x34791D32

0x51EF4E84
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x3456B2C1
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x2F1429B4
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x4FFAAE97
away, I am sure."
0x98A87D34

0x51EF4E84
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x4D3FD935
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0x74F2E881
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0xAAE09E7A
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0xE7880AEE
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x64DC1F49
fetch you away."
0xB488C0C5

0x51EF4E84
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0x77627467

0x51EF4E84
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x2AE74C5E
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0x3659BAF4
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x1CDD984D
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x0622ECF2
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0x2B8AB9C2
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0xB2F6BC09
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x7FB9AEA6
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0xEA171632
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0x707AD94D
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0xD37E9F31
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xD5E4C860
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0xB1E2D63E
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x2563278D
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x3700D090
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0xE0201A08
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x5FECB9C5

0x51EF4E84
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0x71BAAC18
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x05B6C247
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0xF8F2796E
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x38A0999B
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x9AB65A53
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x7149E855
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0xFABCEF0E
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x868EE7AD
in spite of its grandeur.
0x868C0A62

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x33E3BD70
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x2309E314
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0xB8F3A357
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xEBC4A0C1

0x51EF4E84
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x70EF19F3
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0x3893AE48
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0x8CD3C400
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0xD23DE3E1
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xEDE950ED
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xC0FB59B8
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x1C63B0CD
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0xBBF7C429
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xFBA64D82
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0xBA3F43D1
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0x35278F56
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x89FAAC37
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x78E943D2
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x1AD5F0C4
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x83EEC850
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0xD3FD23C6

0x51EF4E84
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x954028F8
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0xAA8AFB18
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0xECAC0824
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x2782FFA4

0x51EF4E84
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xFB693849
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x276BAF6A
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x10CA57CF
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x87DF83B2
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x443C5845
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0xF9ADD995
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x61B68EE2
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0xDBE1A37F
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x6F1912AF
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x8000FE1C
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x66EC6636
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0x912151EC
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0xED2BF39B
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0x92E53031
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x47904E6D
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x0761735F
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x8E42E9F0
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x6FDFC51C
night.
0x1EF2BECB

0x51EF4E84
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x4998FBC1
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0xE52650FE
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0xAF0C8A41
general opprobrium.
0xB7B150F4

0x51EF4E84
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0xEE1667C0
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x5DE0D05B
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x64B7CA4D
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x42E41EAC
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0x6B59DE03

0x51EF4E84
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x0261A991
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0xB77781B7
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x16CE74FE
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0xFA806340
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xBE3365E8

0x51EF4E84
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0xC574715C
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xA98881C1
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xC794687E
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x9529CF98
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x14A2A5C3
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0xCE665D59
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x33973D40
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0xB41281BB
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x474E17F9
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x2D3EF0EE
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x8ABB1BCB
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0xD6710233
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xA9D56C72

0x51EF4E84
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x4D326F44
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x80A73094
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0xBF0D8B6A
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x57F23D13
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x74C2F7D8
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x625B2A9E
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0xC568C3FC
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0x5741B942
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0xDAE590F3
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x4ED0616E
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0xA0250F07
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xA7293819
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x28280B86
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x34F6C85C
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x72F8D3AA
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x0C71BF9B
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0xA10E265F
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x3E857FA7
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x5D7322E8
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0x89ECC741
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x52A383F4
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x6D5CC36F

0x51EF4E84
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0xE84999E3
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0x6FC54011
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0xA8F28D83
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x8A760CDA
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x72247834
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x208BA913
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x3889AE44
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x7CC75691
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0xE32EC873
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0x90737735
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0x48522576
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x4921749F
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0x19C369FD
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x04AE2231
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x308D608A
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x9B0EBB5B
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0x11AF2F2A
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x72EB3AC7
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x516BD1F9
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x3CDC11DC
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0xD506B888
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0x1C22613F
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0xCEA7CFC4
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0x3F9F52BC
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x75D9B516
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0x9F4136D1
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x95DA71EE
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0xC1A00949
Abbot entered.
0x7A85C92C

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x0B3146F5

0x51EF4E84
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0xE57AD2B4

0x51EF4E84
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xCA7EEC7A

0x51EF4E84
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xBE46D8D5
Bessie.
0xDA574830

0x51EF4E84
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0xDE52C843
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x1F50BD3A

0x51EF4E84
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x019EE680
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x3091DB62
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x4C1DF5C8

0x51EF4E84
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0x4C090A19
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0xB48DF069
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x96899F13
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0xCDCA1F5B

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0x694820BB

0x51EF4E84
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0xA685EF59
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x0966B588
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x1C239B07
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x6222DB45
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x5B2EF9D7
then."
0xCD214D32

0x51EF4E84
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0x7A5807F4
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x0F91EC3F

0x51EF4E84
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0xC27F5AE1
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0xC8A48291
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0xAEA4DDD2
duplicity.
0x813212A6

0x51EF4E84
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0xA59E6930
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x8F3A77EB
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x95E63DE6
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0xEA320B88

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xB1EA6977
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x6327AEE2
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x4DC87D69
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x30838B0F
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x60230D98
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0xCDF14774
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x81BAA29F
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0x24CA3440
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xC5E265D1

0x51EF4E84
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x5A9C6DA3
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0x27EBC1F4
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x59828806
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x8BC56B37
pillow, leaning over me.
0xE293ED50

0x51EF4E84
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0x291D5D76
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x4B1848B9
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x497C9549
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0xBEC640A7
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x416DDF14
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x05B23249
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x5A00F046
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0xB698B401

0x51EF4E84
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xBFE29AA1

0x51EF4E84
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0x95723B73
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x90F7C4B9
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0x9A42EC1E
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0xBD8E88D6
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x1A50E91A
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x2FF36286
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0xF1AD7FB6
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x09B58CC6

0x51EF4E84
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x3EDE3EFE

0x51EF4E84
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x25B53653
rough.  "I will try."
0x0374E48D

0x51EF4E84
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x3073014F

0x51EF4E84
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xF1F43BEB

0x51EF4E84
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x5CD6B8DE
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0xADF0E06A

0x51EF4E84
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0x948213D1

0x51EF4E84
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x8FAA59D0

0x51EF4E84
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x118E1C6C
soon, no doubt."
0x7B47E113

0x51EF4E84
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0x1528737D
say--
0x8879927F

0x51EF4E84
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xAD77647F
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x745F3942
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x3D48C00D
rather too hard."
0xA7248BCF

0x51EF4E84
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x5AFC0D64
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0xAC6CF20C
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0x32C61E8E
the main subject discussed.
0x2ECDB207

0x51EF4E84
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x01DDB97C
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0x53094D95
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x5BED8E63

0x51EF4E84
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0x0EA8B200
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x90A8CA72
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0xF01939C5

0x51EF4E84
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xBE5CE489
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x7211F4DC
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xB5257670
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x45C97624
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x1B6605BE
bad propensities.
0x324320AE

0x51EF4E84
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0xCC5C1B47
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0xCB770DF0
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0x5B07BE8E
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0xBB64C39F
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0xF3FFCFA1
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x9875ECDE
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0xEDD92C37
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0x3BA8F5BE
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x46D8F5A2
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0x7A9724E3
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xD96E92E0
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0xEC0D0224
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0x82373A72

0x51EF4E84
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0x94AF8DC8
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x4CCD2C9C
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x4A0D59B4
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x2841E188
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0x6B0CD255
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x90B6A4C3
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0xDD0F445A
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x108BD660
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xBA7D3B4C
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xF23C4EEE
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x6D2DC551
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x08C1959E
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x3C24445C
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x87718ECB
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0xC1371885
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0xC468EAC5
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x9421481F
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x9DB51A17
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0xA01B8ACB
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x6A7F5D30
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x1958FCD0
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0x793C57B8
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x17795974
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x9A15753D
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x9B13A5FF
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x43238D92
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xC52BB132
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x9B1103CA
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0x45A078F8
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0xC8F951BA
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0x2686446C
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x3F9260B9
untasted tart.
0xEE6F3F1C

0x51EF4E84
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x51D980F1
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xB2337781
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x330115BB
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x794FC27F

0x51EF4E84
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x15EC60EE
      A long time ago."
0x1837C970

0x51EF4E84
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0xF08BDF6D
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x73647AB7
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x95B23E63
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0xDECD0E7C
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0x228FF589
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x0DB10B44
one.
0xB486784A

0x51EF4E84
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x112EF12E
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0xF8CD0071
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x29FD68EA
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0xE5160285

0x51EF4E84
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0xCF3B215C
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0xA6982464
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x0ECAEF27
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x5DAF6EE1

0x51EF4E84
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x2FC542E0
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0xCE67E14D
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xF2782168
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0x5AD2C80E

0x51EF4E84
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0xFB44F35A
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x5E4FAE44
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x43E4E436
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0xB8C0E973

0x51EF4E84
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x0BCC4B4E
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x9B3327D9
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0x290BFBB3
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0x6C0F78EC

0x51EF4E84
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x588CA7F7
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x7FA1703E
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x4ABDC204
Lloyd came again.
0x3D07CEE7

0x51EF4E84
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x8D5733FF
how is she?"
0x3ABFAB77

0x51EF4E84
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0x09D1612A

0x51EF4E84
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x8979A289
is Jane, is it not?"
0x1EACF189

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x8291678F

0x51EF4E84
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x4B9FDAA7
Have you any pain?"
0x3FC951CB

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir."
0x2F5C6E86

0x51EF4E84
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x49D74600
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0x1547DDFE

0x51EF4E84
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0xC9422C04

0x51EF4E84
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0xB3C32804
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x1FE68952
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xCB6B75BD

0x51EF4E84
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x9FC59C5B

0x51EF4E84
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x971C2ADB
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0xEA366627
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x8E9C99E0
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0x2BD9EE33
leisure, he said--
0xF5DBC884

0x51EF4E84
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0x0B03CE87

0x51EF4E84
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x7F56F1E7

0x51EF4E84
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x94AF0188
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x3F42784A

0x51EF4E84
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0xFD8CB48C
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x114731EE
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xE176A6E7

0x51EF4E84
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x8D66C0E6
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0xC62D0EAC
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x57134003

0x51EF4E84
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0xC896DB09
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x5C836F54

0x51EF4E84
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x6184DCE1
Bessie was gone.
0xDE15A856

0x51EF4E84
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0xC3CEE349

0x51EF4E84
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0x290571B9

0x51EF4E84
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0x4E24DC0E

0x51EF4E84
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0xFD1D8FF8
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x9BB93BB1
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x2FACFE1E
that I think I shall never forget it."
0xC73AC81E

0x51EF4E84
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0x80A2D981
daylight?"
0xE55B332D

0x51EF4E84
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0xFF4605DF
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0x04FF83FC

0x51EF4E84
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0xED95598D

0x51EF4E84
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0x7B4BF20F
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x763E6156
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xB8ADE18F
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0x1209A0F3
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x7E1C0C93
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0x67A036A3
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x7C7A39DC

0x51EF4E84
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0xCA9B1EB7

0x51EF4E84
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x8EC76C96

0x51EF4E84
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0xB54C927C

0x51EF4E84
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x0DB19133

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xEC895F00

0x51EF4E84
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0x9DCBE658
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0xEBAE4553

0x51EF4E84
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0xDC13D547
than a servant."
0xBDA955ED

0x51EF4E84
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0x5A0F8325

0x51EF4E84
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x936C77DF
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0x9C7D9D5B

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x91E8A883

0x51EF4E84
"I think not, sir."
0x370D79A0

0x51EF4E84
"None belonging to your father?"
0x0CEC45CA

0x51EF4E84
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xD2B60740
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x6B1EE83A
them."
0x34791D32

0x51EF4E84
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0xA4CA22D7

0x51EF4E84
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x988A4A0D
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xB4B80C1A
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0xA4A189B5
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x1DDA0AD7
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x499F3B94

0x51EF4E84
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0xCC0DA130

0x51EF4E84
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x1BA22452

0x51EF4E84
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x2D01DA4F
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x318C44C7
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x4A192834
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x387DA5AB
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0x0F2B8892
the price of caste.
0x29425C10

0x51EF4E84
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x1FFD3AA9

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0x9048B3E5
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x4F33F8E1

0x51EF4E84
"Would you like to go to school?"
0xF3A211DA

0x51EF4E84
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x37D6C6F8
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xE7D723C5
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x24B440DC
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x3C6678D3
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x79724DAA
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xAA7C302B
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xDB849901
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0xDBA6D1A0
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0x0E0BFA96
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x8FB45931
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0xB304AC65
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0xE7241F8D
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x8B9960A7
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0xD667A63B

0x51EF4E84
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0xC469B15D
musings.
0x17FE6F12

0x51EF4E84
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0x32291E4E
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x9D95754D
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x4CD75006

0x51EF4E84
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x7A2293B7
the gravel-walk.
0x973F3D02

0x51EF4E84
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0x1F17C1A1
to her before I go."
0x2C6323A5

0x51EF4E84
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0xAE2C8EE2
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0x5294E7D5
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x0356891A
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0x82D7FC43
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0xAC54217F
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x64374AB6
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x8B4D5C0E
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x53AFF89D
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0xEE45D7AC
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x522E9E1D

0x51EF4E84
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0x06208496
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0x0FA7D283
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x07CAE82F
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0xC28ED13A
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x66B5A212
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x3E815DCA
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x967689AD
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x695B620D
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0xC091A437
of each other.
0x0DEB612F

0x51EF4E84
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x57A722D2
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x64B109BE

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x06E9AA4A
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x39B44F9F
little toad as that."
0x42A318CB

0x51EF4E84
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0x27C4B899
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x671B5985

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0x642FD956
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x9B5F8F91
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x0CF0FF7A
rabbit for supper."
0xECF40E3E

0x51EF4E84
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
0x81D2F1AD

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER IV
0x1E48015C

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0x6931AEA0
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0xE98C16FA
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xC079A521
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x702B2E68
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x827544F4
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0x362DBE6B
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x453DFDD2
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0xAC095858
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x55F5B4F6
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x2D8EA340
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x93E91B53
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x0170D1DE
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0xD0335274
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x8549338F
and rooted aversion.
0x26C8F430

0x51EF4E84
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0xD7602B7F
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xE961A9E4
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0x4DF5A0D2
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0xFF38C0EC
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0xD9ABE972
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x8FEB4868
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xEEE9045E
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x3D223753
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0x8EA5DDBB
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x33C9A952
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xF3773636
was stopped rather harshly--
0xBF47134B

0x51EF4E84
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0xEB0B2B8C
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0xA8BB35F6
should associate with her."
0xC97F90E8

0x51EF4E84
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x9C7A42F1
deliberating on my words--
0x5F85642D

0x51EF4E84
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x51CEE93B

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x5839743E
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x4DE8E6E8
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x6FE01EAF
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0xF320CBFD
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x508F945E

0x51EF4E84
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x4251C118
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x48A9D5B6
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0xC90ABD08
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x54338352

0x51EF4E84
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xE58FDB6E
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x4CA87C01
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0x5CC27DB2
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x34AD0727

0x51EF4E84
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x62DD4681
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0x706762B4
wish me dead."
0xBCBF696A

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x3C1A4E0D
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0x058F7AD3
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0xF313FDCC
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0x295141E7
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0xCA115B61
in my breast.
0xFA22F9F5

0x51EF4E84
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x641BEC08
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x6F8E8947
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0x557C5CCE
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0xAF70293C
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0x21A6CDB2
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0x1A5B5F12
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x9C9A677A
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x0B8796DE
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0xAF3F1CFC
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xED32E1C4
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x3A194F07
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x6B5F5A34
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0x34075438
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0xD5A61B7A
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0xB49A7D10
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0x4BFD1FA2
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0xB6ADEAFA
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x7772CCF3
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x7E9BAE7E
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x8CF57620
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0x63F6D50E
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x1FD58620
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0xC22DBB64
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x5816D44B
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x46145D37
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0xAA205639
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0xB1B224B3
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xD75A94BD
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x81FB293A
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x8555880D
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0x409C7B69
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x692AF8F7
to be happy likewise.
0xD8880A67

0x51EF4E84
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x64FB0D49
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0xF8C1DA5C
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x26684DC2
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x0C889ED2
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0xD0DCF778
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x9943B3B3
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x7EF9DCD4
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0xC6A8009C
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x7839A888
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0x17C8E6F7
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x87336CF7
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0x2E2A6E96
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x42AEA34A
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0x2D5590C2
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x4D1D2D96
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x363BF148
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0xBFA033ED
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x95C40AAF
Gateshead Hall.
0xB1806F4A

0x51EF4E84
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xEB7F1D00
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0xC58E662C
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0xC7FE001F
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x26511466
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0xB637872E
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x8056724B
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x96340388
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x88F421AD
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0x89A3E837
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x203BDDB4
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x03673172
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x63E6B381
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xBFC426F7
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x546EA209
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xBB9B156B
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0xDD6F4B76
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x2862B36D
accuracy.
0xDBB03398

0x51EF4E84
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x21B6A13B
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0xB3079880
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0xA3C2CAA2
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0xE83A4BD0
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0xF96FD3D4
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0xB4615FB2
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x22346692
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xAF7C5DD4
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x702526C3
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x57437C00
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x0CD2011E
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x6F16651F
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x34568BD3
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0x168E7111
frost.
0x94EC60FF

0x51EF4E84
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0xA4A68EAE
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x7EDA7337
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0x11CAE36B
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0x7ACF3DC1
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0x0A49F9C1
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0xB4A9DDCA
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0x62660DB4
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x69631D44
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x9C7AE28F
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0x172DB7B8
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x5886A516
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0xF35F7858
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0x435FA011
nursery.
0xEFD1C3F9

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x023236EC
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x0126FBD9
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x146526E1
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x43B14FB1
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0xFD3899DA

0x51EF4E84
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x74783419

0x51EF4E84
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0xFA8DA08C
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x36CE1D26
window for?"
0xF566B701

0x51EF4E84
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x2DD51445
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xD980D6DD
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0xD6B06482
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0xF20F695B
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x07A45659
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0x53C6DB1D

0x51EF4E84
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0xA68EFFEB
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0xED7D55BA
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0xD13DEA39
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x21D9B4A3
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x79D035B4
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0xF663E846

0x51EF4E84
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0x2312A1AA
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x70660F9F
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0xE8D00E1A
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x8B59A5DD
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x1AAB5940
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0xB4A87E08

0x51EF4E84
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0xFE8824D8
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x05D5BCF7
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x923157F8
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x27104D13
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0xFBBA1FD5
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x179E30DB
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x1F2A0AA7
by way of capital.
0xBF385AF8

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0xDA995633
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x32C82E2E
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x285EC34F
you."
0x1DCA8A53

0x51EF4E84
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x309F9DBD
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0xA0158635
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x5815C7D0
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x637E0E2F

0x51EF4E84
"Ten years."
0x7A3EEE59

0x51EF4E84
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0xECD37A3E
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0xDCE34EA3

0x51EF4E84
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0xEA4D0325

0x51EF4E84
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x3632D2F3
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0xF1BF6B31
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0x6F30A485

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x9676E6EA

0x51EF4E84
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x660EAF0B
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x4CE7F0D9
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x8DA90FBF
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x0791B15A

0x51EF4E84
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x25A37396
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x9DC88B39
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0xFDB2F221

0x51EF4E84
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0xF655617B
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x4019525D
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x7F6EB32B

0x51EF4E84
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x239E7B13
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x484C800E

0x51EF4E84
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x591062D7

0x51EF4E84
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x6002D372

0x51EF4E84
"A pit full of fire."
0xA7232410

0x51EF4E84
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0xBB9D5D33
ever?"
0xFA5F0E1A

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir."
0x2F5C6E86

0x51EF4E84
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x8C756D95

0x51EF4E84
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x6157AF78
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xAA5904A3

0x51EF4E84
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xA71CA39A
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0xEAC2DB25
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x09CD16A2
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x34CAD405

0x51EF4E84
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0xCDFFDD2F
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0x181DDF9A
enough away.
0xBE9A225B

0x51EF4E84
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x1F674ED5
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0xD912F54C

0x51EF4E84
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x9F010FE2
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x976FA659

0x51EF4E84
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x8216EA43

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x2B982BD5

0x51EF4E84
"Sometimes."
0xA0BB5E88

0x51EF4E84
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x51E93BC9

0x51EF4E84
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xB6105278
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xA1AEBD90
and Jonah."
0x1D01FCAE

0x51EF4E84
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0xE7B85112

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir."
0x2F5C6E86

0x51EF4E84
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0xD80FE1D5
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x36F49AD8
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0xA3DA3849
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x290ED123
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0xC4BF8445
piety."
0x1E5EC78E

0x51EF4E84
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0xBC8C4183

0x51EF4E84
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x33480497
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x4F50C184
give you a heart of flesh."
0x8E0E8032

0x51EF4E84
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x22C378F9
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0xEFCEE6FF
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0x5D660F55
conversation herself.
0x79837698

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0xDC15DBFB
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0x98D50547
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x49906649
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xE639D657
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x18BD3DCD
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xEBDB089C
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xA241E59F

0x51EF4E84
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x8D522ABB
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x925032F7
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0x09F752A1
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xEA8C0A69
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0xD2717E72
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x02BFB50B
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x8F0FC6FD
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x529F1E0B
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0x0B98FA07
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0x9B1995C7

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0xAD04D783
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x796CFCBC

0x51EF4E84
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0xB32E3476
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0x0E1731B6
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0x1D063C95
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x4908A4B2

0x51EF4E84
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xE5DF766E
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x495A619F
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0xFB0815F0
Lowood."
0x322FF66A

0x51EF4E84
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x3213C14F
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x0BA8A0CB
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x96348576
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x3889AE23
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xE0697168
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xFD586BF1
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x0AF42CDC
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x1E4894C5
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x33B77630
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x855F519B
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x93F4703B
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x4BA3BB4C

0x51EF4E84
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x821CF821
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0x016F9FD6
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x8B978BF6
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x0C3978DD

0x51EF4E84
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0xE804DDD5
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xF86C3166
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x67897A22
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xC7168C63
inhabitants."
0xE016D2F5

0x51EF4E84
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x1EAD2847
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0xAB2B46C7
and prospects?"
0x87B18983

0x51EF4E84
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x5D36CB66
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0x34DCF9A2
of her election."
0xC58033DD

0x51EF4E84
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0xAE95BA55
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x07CB90D6
becoming too irksome."
0xBD8E3B61

0x51EF4E84
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0x8F258949
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0xA4B532FC
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x6E01D79B
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x4A1DF6C0
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x3AF5B6E8

0x51EF4E84
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x8E176C4D
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0xA8948056

0x51EF4E84
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0xAE2054FF
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0xCEBBAD94
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x69C08B4B
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x1860EB42

0x51EF4E84
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0x1084B3E5
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0x128081D9

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x1D13834D
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0xB21F900E
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x53E1EAA8
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0x76D68A2B
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0xD47C9CFC
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0xCD94C9AF
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x9E43E1F0
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0xA19EAACA
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0x67D52A92
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x6C7DF7B2
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0xFAC622A8
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0xB2EB7741
handsome attire.
0x59688192

0x51EF4E84
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xD447AA9B
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0xF43E2AF0
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x0C2FC162
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x62109BB5
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0xF7F89CC2
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x6E9809DA
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x90C1E8E2
fomented now within me.
0xBA43C0EF

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x4B9E7E0F
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0xBE3F4FE6

0x51EF4E84
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x7C86034B
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x00F77EF0
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0xC16839BF
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xEE341B51
to her.
0x58EB8936

0x51EF4E84
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x0843855B
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x19E0A0ED
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x25AD63D0

0x51EF4E84
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0xA08AE77C
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0xF3B4AE07
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x9ED0A2B2
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x9E3F9526

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x417D5590
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0xB58F1EB4

0x51EF4E84
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xB7B4504D
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0xE8466AD7
used to a child.
0xE538E3FB

0x51EF4E84
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0xBFFAC5A4
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0xC028175C

0x51EF4E84
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x64205354
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x8E7698EF
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0xF9CB3A56
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x71D28649
miserable cruelty."
0x5B1B58A7

0x51EF4E84
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0xDDFAC89F

0x51EF4E84
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x7E9CDF07
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0xABB1B13C
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0xA7C18458
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xD28C6261
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0xBAF6B1D4
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0xDA583B1A
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0xAF92855C
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0x9EB41FF4
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x4A10A41B
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0xDEFBF4A4

0x51EF4E84
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xA985B08A

0x51EF4E84
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0x1505F559
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x54B8B523
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x26F7B243
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x30588129
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0xC07C5F80
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x8CE376BE
would cry.
0xAD985C33

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0xD8551FF6
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x22763069

0x51EF4E84
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x51F97E11

0x51EF4E84
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x1336DBBD
your friend."
0x9FCB62D0

0x51EF4E84
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xB14CADCC
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xFF25BFB4
you have done."
0xF2C45EE3

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x6D0F1EEC
their faults."
0x0F9EA589

0x51EF4E84
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0xDFAA3294

0x51EF4E84
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x8F17DF5F
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0xA30D7CFC

0x51EF4E84
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x1E059076
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xD182B215

0x51EF4E84
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0xD5B714BC
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0xED690A02

0x51EF4E84
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x16912123
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0x2BEAEDAA
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x3538EA7B
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x1CC62366
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x73F86255
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xEEB5D422
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0xF108512E
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0x321A4F63
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0xC4F50A48
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0xC8149815
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x06DBB443
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x969204B1
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x7D4B4144
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x4B4D109F

0x51EF4E84
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x2686F956
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0x145989DF
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x3901DFCA
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0xFB2B40C8
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x7D5A1FCB
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x933DBA33
of my nature.
0x4A0D1AD4

0x51EF4E84
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0xE4239E8D
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x4880DE74
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x60B55C92
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0xDF3CDE4F
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x1FB7854A
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xA56D15A9
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0x13E13D48
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0x3C76A509
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0xFBCA7BC2
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x9DFB4ACC
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x321CF89F
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xA25703C7
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x61E6EC15
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x2C168C9C
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0xC4D8DE56
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0xAADA0102
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x024B8EA7
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x9A49EF12

0x51EF4E84
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xE30783FC
to lunch!"
0x08D620C7

0x51EF4E84
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xB2D55D1C
came tripping down the path.
0xA23F7CBE

0x51EF4E84
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0xB2947C47
called?"
0xE27F68B4

0x51EF4E84
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x2BA54979
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x69CD8E29
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0x4C68E934
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0xC783DEE6
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0xC80C26F4
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0xDEA6422D

0x51EF4E84
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0x81277168
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xA7985E70

0x51EF4E84
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0x680CC509
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x91F1DD6E
suppose?"
0xA79C6258

0x51EF4E84
I nodded.
0xBEC27B58

0x51EF4E84
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0xD1E4B58B

0x51EF4E84
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x6ADF1F63

0x51EF4E84
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0x1F50E87B
be bolder."
0xFFD90770

0x51EF4E84
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x3F55A6D4

0x51EF4E84
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0xE46F2D8A
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x3E46F0CF
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0xBA2EDFBF
for you."
0x2DBC594B

0x51EF4E84
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0x4DDE786F

0x51EF4E84
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0xC5308590
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0xCFFAE880
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xA7308D1E
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xFE55BCB6
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x78439241
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x4EED48ED

0x51EF4E84
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0xFB3AE207

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0xCBFCC763
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0xD332757B
provoking."
0xD515B867

0x51EF4E84
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0x5C0FD9E6
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x9F743365
dread."
0x8D65E67D

0x51EF4E84
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0xF5F07451

0x51EF4E84
"As you do, Bessie?"
0xB587DD2D

0x51EF4E84
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0x1A243E92
others."
0x67B6261A

0x51EF4E84
"You don't show it."
0xFB43709A

0x51EF4E84
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xC4CCA1D7
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x60F7F242

0x51EF4E84
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x87421486
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0xD6CD4FE9
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x77013034

0x51EF4E84
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0xAA749559

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x747A89AA

0x51EF4E84
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0xFC2D12A7
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0xA74AE8CD
you'd _rather_ not."
0x78A06048

0x51EF4E84
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0xC3458FD9
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0xD8AA44F4
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0x676ECF91
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0xB5C00F66
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0x86632422

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER V
0xBD3D7255

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x44835E44
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x5AC4561E
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0xBF26246A
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0xAC11F10B
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xD55EAE63
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x44B5A1DC
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0xC12CE53A
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x706CDDD1
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xACF074D3
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0xC7F1A682
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xC42D7B1A
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x689B6314
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xA2DFA2C5
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x3902FCD7
bye?"
0x03DEF45E

0x51EF4E84
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0xD7FC4CD9
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x1B433938
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x28333F28
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x2A6AFEE7

0x51EF4E84
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x758801F9

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x04F8E574
the wall."
0xF745E95E

0x51EF4E84
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0xD14AF705

0x51EF4E84
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0xBB021430
been my foe."
0x03999537

0x51EF4E84
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0x8D1C7B05

0x51EF4E84
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0x1ADF8E31
out at the front door.
0x13C701F1

0x51EF4E84
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x2527CB29
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0xE8A2843E
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0x80A134A0
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x3B46420E
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x995483E3
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x77B1A3AE
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0x46152AB8
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0x7BC7E43B
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0xBA1341C3

0x51EF4E84
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x618FE3C4

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"And how far is it?"
0x38B85515

0x51EF4E84
"Fifty miles."
0xA60D0F85

0x51EF4E84
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0xB264F3AE
alone."
0x75F7D324

0x51EF4E84
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xB2828596
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x9E8850DA
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0xA0EF294E
with kisses.
0xB74D5267

0x51EF4E84
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x7CBD8AB6
me into the inside.
0xCF55392C

0x51EF4E84
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0x41416E84
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0x71972E48
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x872618C8
mysterious regions.
0xDBA55B99

0x51EF4E84
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0xEB9C2B39
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x4670CF3E
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0xE5D0E9B6
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xBB2B07DD
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0xD85E8E8D
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0xD639D629
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xC6617543
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x9A8C3760
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x42702444
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0xEBDFDC4C
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0xBE791CBB
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xD0EF5FEF
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0xB3B23277
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0x4A7EFA9D
"stony street" of L-.
0xBAF043F3

0x51EF4E84
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x84B6DE34
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0xB35CC3F0
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x731FD7CB
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0xE5194E5A
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x8555D671
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0xB6D257B0

0x51EF4E84
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x5C728CAC
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0xC581BCF0
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x368027B3
by the light of the lamps.
0xA8B2F404

0x51EF4E84
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x12210914
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x769A5549
instantly drove away.
0xAEEBFDA1

0x51EF4E84
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x9F4660D4
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x3DCBACC0
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0xF2C5180F
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0xFC241F61
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x8679F526
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x68EB5EB0
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0x284B2575
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0xC1FD345A
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x7733A36B

0x51EF4E84
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0xF4CAEA55
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xDF66B852
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x512A59A9
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x338AA69E
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x2DBDC96C
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0xB08ADC0D
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x93F28F8C

0x51EF4E84
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0xE6931CFC
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0xEE24D58C
grave, her bearing erect.
0x8344ED2E

0x51EF4E84
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0xE088475A
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0xA39BC710
then further added--
0x38FADC54

0x51EF4E84
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0x4FE018E4
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0xA01F1C1F

0x51EF4E84
"A little, ma'am."
0x947A03E6

0x51EF4E84
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0xF8A43C3E
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0xD0633636
come to school, my little girl?"
0x8F2D090E

0x51EF4E84
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x1FB249DC
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x0BDA0BBC
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x48248B88
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0xF2A989B0
me along with Miss Miller.
0xCFFE8712

0x51EF4E84
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x46C82688
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0xDD8E8905
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0xEDD84BE8
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x228381CB
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0xACEB6E2D
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0x47F43349
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0xCAA1CB24
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x15DE3FBA
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0xE40089AE
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x327D3B78
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x16296460
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x12B47E5A
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x7A104B67
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x0771A00A
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x8F4044E6
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x6A59D6AF
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x481F12F2
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0xF4F128B5

0x51EF4E84
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x1BE60ED5
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x8DCF7317

0x51EF4E84
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xF6647693

0x51EF4E84
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0x9DD88A4F
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x99F8B059

0x51EF4E84
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0xCE0225B7

0x51EF4E84
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x906B55F6
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x1CD532A0
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xE4E90022
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x0F44F54A
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x1FB1B091
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x21EC1DD4
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x5BC4A5B7

0x51EF4E84
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0xBB36D375
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x3FFA3E23
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0xEDFC59E9
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0xD30A62CB
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x281B77CE
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x71F83E77
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0xD39B2733
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x0D345885

0x51EF4E84
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x7F025DF0
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x88DC2C70
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x3C268664
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x98927C41
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x6F77A70E
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x5E75E6B4
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x2D069BF0
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0xBE3BFC74
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0xB1D8D39D
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0xCF11B473
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0xAEB64410
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x08A1D78B

0x51EF4E84
"Form classes!"
0x22C822AF

0x51EF4E84
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0xB94C14C3
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0xAA380129
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x2B873DD9
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0x68475DB8
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0x7EAE5C10
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0x63DA1935
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x77A83AF1

0x51EF4E84
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x5B910391
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0xACB53714
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0xC2D737D4
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0x7BF19C40
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x963B7236

0x51EF4E84
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x5F35F8F3
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0xFB18CF9E
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0xD2E569FF
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0xB9AAFB84
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x0536B95F
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0xF02C084B
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x1B78710F
little the day before.
0xDC6505A0

0x51EF4E84
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x0814EAA4
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0x1306F7D0
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0xDC88C98E
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x79E758DD
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x2E25716A
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0xFAC09BDA

0x51EF4E84
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x38635761

0x51EF4E84
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x40E26A4A
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0xA005D9CB
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xF1B2C168
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x8D94D764
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x9879759C
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0xCEB923FB
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x88D919B3
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x4039944C
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x5D21C690
the meal began.
0xF2D957A0

0x51EF4E84
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0xC8C55D64
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x33373DEF
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x731FA314
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0xB7AA910C
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xD2BDD09B
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x6C435E70
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x49305628
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xE62F2666
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0x4F0C2DEA
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x507B422C
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x3B278163
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x7DE71E44

0x51EF4E84
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x82DD1017

0x51EF4E84
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x389A9433
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0xAD4C551A
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xE9B11AC3
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x701733A9
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0xA7711D8B
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0xE7A5B6C7
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0x5AE04784
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x0A4B78D1
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0xEE33F349
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0xD098E422

0x51EF4E84
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x8C199616
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x66078EFE

0x51EF4E84
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x80DC1D9F

0x51EF4E84
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xD2717CDD
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0xEA643541
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x0278B6F3
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x130702CA
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0xECBBFAC1
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x3C5CB3B0
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xF8550E90
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0xA8FAB9B2
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0xA6716713
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0xFF0A8542
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0xC3A160B8
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xD58AAFDE
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0xFA85589F

0x51EF4E84
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x33A8A385
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x3A1A934A
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x841E7582
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0xB0D4F7BB
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x51E96746
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0xD0D593D6

0x51EF4E84
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x1C7B12CC
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0xE57B2D13
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x628734C3
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x5B58710E
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0xDB694BC4
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x36D91342
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0x44A9AC01
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x72132EDF

0x51EF4E84
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x94A0B002

0x51EF4E84
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x9CDF14E7
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xBDAB8A71
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x63FE78BB
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0x089CCBFD
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0xF627FD29
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xD53A7A08
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x49431FB6
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0xF55CF23F
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0x5F62E40B
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x0FD11E12
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x95D71C36
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xD80AAE04
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xE862AD6B
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x052D81FC
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0xC4D6D413
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x6A31FB88

0x51EF4E84
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x2955BCCD
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0xA74D436A
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0xB7A8428A
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0xAD584211
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x11672C74
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x5BBA0872
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xEB2EA173
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0xF7A27FD0

0x51EF4E84
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0x5A997FFB

0x51EF4E84
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x4B911F5C
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x24D63F6C

0x51EF4E84
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0xCB93D91C
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0xAD1F43BB
to all."
0xA3693DCD

0x51EF4E84
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x4E0123B7

0x51EF4E84
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0xB35363AD
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xC1530829

0x51EF4E84
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0xA789160E
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x24B3D01D
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x2EA3C9BA
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x18F71EE4
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x1EF41737

0x51EF4E84
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0xDFB2F41A
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x3DE3B851
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x480865DB
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0xBD7BC982
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0x862C60FA
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0xC1E23F66
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xE93CDEB5
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x4928473A
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0x9269D0F4
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x3F5210E0
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0x688E8690
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0xD74BCF6D
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0x38E19BD5
hollow cough.
0x074D36A8

0x51EF4E84
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x1C014017
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0x8344C630
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x15DE18A7
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0x32CB834D
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0x7A57CA24
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x37E9DA28
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0xAC54A385
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x8E66DDC2
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0xA2D2F975
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x721A77FE
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0xA6BF3628
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x373B6D6F
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0x8F2701BA
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0x1A2D8657
this inscription:--
0xD3C2B450

0x51EF4E84
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0x3D3E9A27
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x48281D3C
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x4FA6AB28
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x2D39ED2B

0x51EF4E84
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x8902C926
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x9B049106
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0xCFFCA4A5
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0xB71225DD
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x749ADA22
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x54B5764B
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x04AADE34
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0x702A9236
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0xC6E5F29A
I said to her directly--
0x6D6D5DFA

0x51EF4E84
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0xD02CE24A
her to lend it to me some day.
0x7FA29109

0x51EF4E84
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0xAE6CFB2E
she examined me.
0x74A3FDF7

0x51EF4E84
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x5E5FA62F
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0xEDF68E3D
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x745A5AA2
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x90F7EBDE
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0xF9CDBFF8
or substantial.
0x69259989

0x51EF4E84
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0xDBF3D80B

0x51EF4E84
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0xCC757420
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x3BA25BA2
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0xBFA2D7A2
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x6C9CB44F
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0xC2B067D9
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xEF160351

0x51EF4E84
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0x6A4B62E6
is Lowood Institution?"
0xCC242FA7

0x51EF4E84
"This house where you are come to live."
0x2A70F0CB

0x51EF4E84
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0x219701B7
other schools?"
0x1902B160

0x51EF4E84
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0x4B1E3196
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0xAB9C544E
father or your mother dead?"
0xDBCEB539

0x51EF4E84
"Both died before I can remember."
0xE9D13D05

0x51EF4E84
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0xD1C91409
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0xC8F1E45C

0x51EF4E84
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0x78A7CD7B

0x51EF4E84
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0xD8BA6C64

0x51EF4E84
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0x82A217C5

0x51EF4E84
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0x32AF488B
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0xEB9DD443

0x51EF4E84
"Who subscribes?"
0xC64FEFB5

0x51EF4E84
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0xC7BF1B29
and in London."
0xB724D5B5

0x51EF4E84
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0x5A4C2B81

0x51EF4E84
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0xE51980AE
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0x5FB6FB6C

0x51EF4E84
"Why?"
0x66842582

0x51EF4E84
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x69D47630

0x51EF4E84
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x44A77AD1
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0xC4480F35

0x51EF4E84
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0x97D6D0E7
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x68FB4987
all our clothes."
0x7004CD9E

0x51EF4E84
"Does he live here?"
0x672FE892

0x51EF4E84
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0xB2E606F6

0x51EF4E84
"Is he a good man?"
0x2D204C04

0x51EF4E84
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0x9A9C5598

0x51EF4E84
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0x98EB3CDA

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0x2DE9E405

0x51EF4E84
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0xA3A1D198
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0x0649210D
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0xA361E0B4
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0xCEBB8717
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0x484D2D87
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0x6ECB36E2
teaches French."
0x083016CE

0x51EF4E84
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x669A0213

0x51EF4E84
"Well enough."
0x3B2DC1D0

0x51EF4E84
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x14C84206
pronounce her name as you do."
0x9F84B4A1

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0xBD1F449B
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0x3FCE9E54

0x51EF4E84
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x74B5FA4B

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0xCF5BE2AD
she knows far more than they do."
0xF292F6E3

0x51EF4E84
"Have you been long here?"
0xC767234A

0x51EF4E84
"Two years."
0xD3687222

0x51EF4E84
"Are you an orphan?"
0x6CD0C2A8

0x51EF4E84
"My mother is dead."
0x31D81187

0x51EF4E84
"Are you happy here?"
0x072264AB

0x51EF4E84
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x49D7017B
the present: now I want to read."
0x919315C5

0x51EF4E84
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xAAFB49AB
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x0CFFD9EA
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0xBAAE7CBB
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x1A1B9729
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0xD6D0AABE
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0x890A8286
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x6E2F19E5
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x373C7913
day's fare would be like this.
0x131A6FD0

0x51EF4E84
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x08E25FEA
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x127BA2E1

0x51EF4E84
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x407C71CE
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0xF54BA265
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x6FDA200B
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0xC2C5A973
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x7A228AC4
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x3CEEEC93
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x9DF7D332
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0x56D4B65D
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x6BB5BA71
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0xD75F7F55
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x27D44FCE
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x2E0338C2
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xDA3FA094
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x2E4457A5
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x7073578F
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0x8869BE3E

0x51EF4E84
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xA7709826
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xF5A0B49E
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x065194DC
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0xA514E45D
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x5BED5257
first day at Lowood.
0x54B46F58

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER VI
0xAC2C00F4

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0x4B9284EC
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0x31EAF469
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0xA4D2FBA0
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0xDC28002F
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x5C607DE7
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0x3B70F272

0x51EF4E84
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0xA13C98EE
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0x6665FFB4
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x5F55F2B1
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0xE8B033E2

0x51EF4E84
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x3A71BC71
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x865B0D90
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x3D631564
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xFB9CB3BC
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0xC2C7DA7C
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x8DD8CB57
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0xE7619B20
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x01D98701
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0xD94214DA
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x2FD70BD6
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x5F8F7DE7
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0xE5035173
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0xE2C16203
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0xF24CD38C
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x21EEA9EB
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x140ACF24
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xF137ED8D
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0xB2D05829
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0xFFBDB91A
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0xCFA5AC2C

0x51EF4E84
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x51A2CDF4
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0x73BF7B35
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0xAAA8A478
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0xBAF83A5B
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x019AE5D0
&c. &c.
0x885BB6F6

0x51EF4E84
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0xB3D8AD17
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x5AE0144E
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0x4BA5FA8C
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0xBC589153
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x5D913D3A
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0x93251647
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0xFDDB8283
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x664AF2F2

0x51EF4E84
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0xC41D550D
morning!"
0xA3718E14

0x51EF4E84
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x2CF01AD0
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0xFC501AB9
as the water was frozen?"
0x0B084261

0x51EF4E84
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0x749E7103
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0xA5279011
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0x4DF4B888
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x70E4EBBA
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x20BF1D09
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xB8C1FA1C
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x6D6B6F9A
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x8C5D5ABD
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0x8AF70B50
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xC831C62C
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xA2817CDB
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0x4EDD001D
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x3F3A6EEE
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x476C1C79
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x68C821BC
altered its ordinary expression.
0x23169A82

0x51EF4E84
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x9FF727A1
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x03F052AD

0x51EF4E84
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0xB871CCE5
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0xC4E543C9
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x4633004D

0x51EF4E84
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x15DEFFBE
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0x55A0F171
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x37499A27
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0xC815D942
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x43E0DD2D
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x53DBB416
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x15EA123B
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xB8AF975F

0x51EF4E84
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x84CF7B62
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0xF5971E39
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0xDEA2544D
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x83517C45
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0xF439348D
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0xEA4DA21A
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x614B094E

0x51EF4E84
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0xDB1D43C3
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0xD1F145B4
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x64F35110
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x8ACF0F1F
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x0C8BE6AE
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xAD4D308E
to clamour.
0xF9827970

0x51EF4E84
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x34CAFE03
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0xB084180E
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x407565A6
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0xC3061A9A

0x51EF4E84
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x08F91C3E

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x58257563

0x51EF4E84
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0xB812DE4C
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x8B204A2C
floor.
0x063C419D

0x51EF4E84
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0xCE9EC887

0x51EF4E84
"Helen."
0xC62A55ED

0x51EF4E84
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x0F53C184

0x51EF4E84
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x337019AA

0x51EF4E84
"Will you ever go back?"
0xCC70D730

0x51EF4E84
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x29A229E3

0x51EF4E84
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x4E9F6BE5

0x51EF4E84
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x62899E8D
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0xE4485621

0x51EF4E84
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0xA61D1DC2

0x51EF4E84
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0xC0E81D35

0x51EF4E84
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0xD538E600
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x5683144E
break it under her nose."
0x16149903

0x51EF4E84
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x93EEB429
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x66085C9C
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0x6D87F581
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x3FD6D8B3
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x6C5B1F91
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0x642FB328

0x51EF4E84
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0x68DEE8E2
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0xFD9FF507
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0x4C10A593

0x51EF4E84
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x6142C05C
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x84AA8005
required to bear."
0xD8ACF1D1

0x51EF4E84
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0x3AD0B391
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0xCC3854C9
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0xF933315D
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x1CC234FF
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x9CB436E0
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x62628AC5

0x51EF4E84
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0xC9891B22
good."
0x93D0D630

0x51EF4E84
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x9FE80BDD
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0xC4085B57
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xB3B24CC1
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0xF96D46BE
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0xAD8030A7
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0x4A735D3A

0x51EF4E84
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0xF894949B
addition: she kept silence.
0x1E658939

0x51EF4E84
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x203F8856

0x51EF4E84
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x0BBCA91D
grave face.
0x27108809

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x2AE8A2B1
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0xCF53860B
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x4C248973
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x0BA16994
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0xA997C327
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0xE1929A56
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0xAEE0E3BD

0x51EF4E84
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x5A708651

0x51EF4E84
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0x9CE92B5D
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0xBEE65A3B
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xD9FD9EFF
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x9D2F4218
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xFFAAF1F4
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x01403E4E
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0x94C2C29C
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0xF2068F97
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0xBB843FE5
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x1F2D8256
answer ready."
0x0E8F7D2A

0x51EF4E84
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x49ABA0B5

0x51EF4E84
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0x531EE8C9
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x077B084D
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x7156D6F4
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x9BEFD356
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0x58DC2016
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x6574E24F
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0xEFF9D39E
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0xC89A5773
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x0C46BBC4
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0x958F232B

0x51EF4E84
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0x56565A6B
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x3A8FE063
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0xD5270520

0x51EF4E84
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0x8A96BFFF

0x51EF4E84
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x0DE6A571
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x73B9D176
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x38C65995
I wished to gain."
0xAC2CA427

0x51EF4E84
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0x0036A3F6

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0x6EC1B6BB
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0x6DB27BC5

0x51EF4E84
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0xAE7E06B7
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0xC20E7504
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x90BCA5C7
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xF551C60F
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x86847496
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x167CF2C4
person who struck us never to do it again."
0x0DC010B6

0x51EF4E84
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0x8A2DCC69
but a little untaught girl."
0xAEBFBB95

0x51EF4E84
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x82FF8A4D
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0xC618D294
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0x627A19EF
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0xAD630F91

0x51EF4E84
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0x33BF6631
civilised nations disown it."
0xC128C507

0x51EF4E84
"How?  I don't understand."
0x6882E4B6

0x51EF4E84
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0xD2EFB156
certainly heals injury."
0x18810B4A

0x51EF4E84
"What then?"
0x4FA63001

0x51EF4E84
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0x9E798846
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0x568E95FD

0x51EF4E84
"What does He say?"
0x856668DF

0x51EF4E84
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0x24EA0EB4
you and despitefully use you."
0x9AAB2A9C

0x51EF4E84
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0x51FCB130
John, which is impossible."
0xC931F3F9

0x51EF4E84
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0xB29D1096
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0x099D6048
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x672A835E
softening.
0x076FE309

0x51EF4E84
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0x8DA9E5D2
remark, but she said nothing.
0xA47CF64A

0x51EF4E84
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0x26421D49
woman?"
0x186BADE9

0x51EF4E84
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0xD0CFF81B
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x19665BC6
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0xCB919A7D
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x465A791D
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0x0A449D57
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xA9EA055D
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x88EDEB47
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x5A4818F2
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0xF0A411E3
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xE821FC71
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x1B0FC73C
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x658D3867
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x872B44A5
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x9DBE9134
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0x1F1C3E54
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x22421B2D
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xBC0639F6
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0xEEDFB747
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0xFA2F41AF
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0x10E334D6
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0x6CD1307E
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x62EAA7A3
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0xCAD4C18F
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0xD7D47A2A
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x6CA8F6D3

0x51EF4E84
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0xDFDBC69D
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xC41C961C
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0x51B60AA6
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0xCC5A7813
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0xBB98F658

0x51EF4E84
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x8C3BF5F7
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x34012E04

0x51EF4E84
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x01DA131E
without reply as without delay.
0xABB15152

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER VII
0xFB91A214

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x6F82A548
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x1A61FC0D
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x7AE8974D
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0xA178C2CD
were no trifles.
0xED3C2BA4

0x51EF4E84
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0x163E056D
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x4CAFE012
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x11F2950C
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0xDE36996A
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x561CC06B
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x079720B0
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x1353120D
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x598DE5EF
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x285C30AA
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0xAE1553C1
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0x98E28656
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0x186DE785
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0xC1E78B0B
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x8EA71A30
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0x7152550E
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0xED305604
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x998524EC
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x6D4E3915
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x7C4658FE

0x51EF4E84
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x336A1F97
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0xE2BA0334
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x894446EE
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x0049847D
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x0E9C9B39
meals, was served round between the services.
0x797D5E12

0x51EF4E84
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x535CCBFE
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xA5227BD4
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x4407AED7

0x51EF4E84
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x9F432B52
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0xA21EE0D6
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0xEAF439A0
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x48703661
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x2A22756E
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x0AD911DD

0x51EF4E84
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0xA3581C12
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x94FC9E10
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0x010E6DD5
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xB696DA64
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x1293E8A4

0x51EF4E84
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x6D9A0910
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x70014975
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0xD7DE23C7
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x336696A2
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x5BEDB3A7
invariably obliged to part with.
0x09490A1F

0x51EF4E84
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0xB402952A
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0xF0D105C7
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xADF094CD
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0xBFF6E663
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0xB035FC5B
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0xBED307AF
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x6F9FC9FF
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0xBE789970
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x54EFD459
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x9FE697AB
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0x199D445E

0x51EF4E84
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0xB5F2E72E
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0x2888051C
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0xFB9BB0DD
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x15E079FD
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x090FF991

0x51EF4E84
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0x6FF1C8BC
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xB96A73CD
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0xAD32924F
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x09D361FD
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0xCB0A44DC
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x20DCE03B
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0xF65F38A2
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0xB1EF6401
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xB2F43814
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x549AA76C
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x85649DB2
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x76FC444A

0x51EF4E84
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xE9415DF4
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x413D4B33
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0x707406B1
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0x28A44E47
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0xF2B55F1D
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x697EC648
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x5027611B

0x51EF4E84
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x7CEDCB4D
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x1AFBBC4F
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0xE164D50E
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xBDFE123C
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x68B93B26
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0x8F8CABF3

0x51EF4E84
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0xD1C3F84B
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x03C0AA40
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x9B32002A
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x2C692EA7
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xD7399FBD
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0xD9A30A34
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0xF41F6131
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x69EA4D38
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0xA12D9293
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x81B56414
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0x2158E7D1

0x51EF4E84
He paused.
0x341D687F

0x51EF4E84
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x5F2F10C5

0x51EF4E84
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0x571B9AB8
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x374C0A00
to one."
0x351AAEE0

0x51EF4E84
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0xC7F78525
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0x75185DDC
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0xDCB9C506
occasion."
0x9BC7E281

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x725F7EC3

0x51EF4E84
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xE19EC266
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x4527AA95
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x033FF3A8
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x9EA135D5
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x7C24C18C
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0xF62F32C3
what authority?"
0xF88A8562

0x51EF4E84
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xD1C3D5CE
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x47367DED
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0xC3F04107

0x51EF4E84
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0xB56470EB
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0xD882E468
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x664649A5
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x3F06A9AC
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0xE0A9A925
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0x1C3F839A
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x1F43A570
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x83FEFDAE
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0x64F16910
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0xE8FC3049
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x61B1ED1F
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0x67F59C25
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0xEE02BB18
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0xAF0BF5EE
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0x99A6E3A9
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x6809E6EB
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x75EBD3E9
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x2B68E30E
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0xEB36BF53

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0xE99EE579
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x793722D5
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0xDACFDA95
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0xBB2553D2
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0xAE93FFCC
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x6BEBEC09
severity.
0x80C2E634

0x51EF4E84
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0x0BB4CA0C
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0xBA2D5FF7
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x6EC8767A
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xDF2B81D4

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0xC6E1A967
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x3EC81169
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0xEB606B97

0x51EF4E84
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x53C05E51

0x51EF4E84
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x089306EB
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0xB928677A
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0x68BE9791
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x273016AA

0x51EF4E84
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0xBDDADE19

0x51EF4E84
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0x6859E46D
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x00E2BB43
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x29685E05
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x2F300AC3
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x6F173B3A
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x322065D4
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0x2C0A83EC

0x51EF4E84
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x8DF874CC
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0xABB93C05
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x26421827
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x8AF98E82
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x17284AD3
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0xF22E89A3
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x8C055092
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x6373A17D

0x51EF4E84
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x86069BDB
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0xDACA72F7

0x51EF4E84
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x02B24D28

0x51EF4E84
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0xB86B32EE

0x51EF4E84
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xAC9C1D02
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x6CDA8F17
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0x41261803
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xB13C138F
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0xC7735F54
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x4B50D8F7
time wasted, of--"
0x067F094F

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x017C98E9
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x4EF7F0C1
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x708986B5
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x4A59FD16
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x780B3A04
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x9732040D
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x58C49302
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x0245A70F
false front of French curls.
0x54A6EDE9

0x51EF4E84
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0xF77A8470
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0xB570FEB9
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0xC2ED09DF
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0xB1204D80
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0xFBC55872
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x4AC96E26
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x636BF25C
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0xC39EDA5E
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x250DD9E1
my attention.
0x83DF3CA7

0x51EF4E84
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x7A4DB15E
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x0EC7A402
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x3AD84BBF
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0x7BA69586
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x713BFAB3
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x96DDB8FA
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xF71E3B43
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xA7436653
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x7CB31F75
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0xAED93424

0x51EF4E84
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x5EEA6077
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x20A9C5E7
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x96032559
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x774A8F66

0x51EF4E84
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x4F083C25
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x2D6EE673
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0xBCC44D7A
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xBD704207

0x51EF4E84
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0xF1C0D1CB
punished."
0xB4270C08

0x51EF4E84
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x70E904CB

0x51EF4E84
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0xAAF62431
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x3233810F
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x8C2DA3EE

0x51EF4E84
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x13AFD4D3
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x0184841F

0x51EF4E84
"Place the child upon it."
0x5C1FF75B

0x51EF4E84
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x3287152A
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0xB6686D9D
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0x85E19709
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x50B18DF0
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0xE93BCA1D

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x962C91DD

0x51EF4E84
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0xE3FD788B
children, you all see this girl?"
0x13E26DEF

0x51EF4E84
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x076C851E
against my scorched skin.
0x74407DFC

0x51EF4E84
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0xA4AEB3E9
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0xAC1F3073
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0xA9703A9E
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0x341D8952
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x8AE5C58D

0x51EF4E84
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0x64066A0F
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xAAA4045F
must be firmly sustained.
0x3BEB3C00

0x51EF4E84
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0xF34F313D
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x82CDB7D8
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0x81137D7E
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xD5A57F28
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x874B3C72
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x21497BEC
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0xBC64B615
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x48641514
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xF49C247A
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x5B46CC30
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0xBBBB2C57
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x5D1709B7

0x51EF4E84
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x8777C892
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0xF0D77948
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0xD2CE7570
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0xCEBDCBC3
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xF4EFC820

0x51EF4E84
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0xE55953E1
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0x69895B87
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0x418E3377
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xC903B985
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x33C9EFB4
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x14A4EFC9
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x2662E31C
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0x91C7B421
waters to stagnate round her."
0x086AD1A5

0x51EF4E84
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x4799D951
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x8210CC0B
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x16A70826
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x4F43DF9E

0x51EF4E84
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0xA77E20EA
her during the remainder of the day."
0x19DA72AB

0x51EF4E84
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0xF563BE1E
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x3C610B98
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x22CAD77D
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0xAC70B11E
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x74B9EFD3
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x357B622E
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xD2470570
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0xCCAB925F
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x19950C2E
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0xDC20C5F2
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x6DAA42FD
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x3E400C9F
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0xFD70085A
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x64714EEC
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0xE654382E
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0xD802046D
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0x36CA134C
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0x04005666
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x8322A4A9
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0x91A1975E
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0xB8064E6C
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0xA378C8AE

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x522AA31E
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x6C5B903C
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x6F188856
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x0ED015AF
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x00D1BBAD
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xBD27B5FE
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x5C2A0DBB
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x439F74AE
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x6F77B07E
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0x84290618
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x00BA5D7A
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x748FB5CD
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x2AD4EED5
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x6915CD72
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0xC98F17B8
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xE583A38C

0x51EF4E84
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x7412735D
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x6B22447D
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0xD45D25D4
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x6C3B31A6

0x51EF4E84
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0xC3BC368B
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0xB48D5CB2
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0xF3A55A33
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x8F10FA94
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0xA2B6CC50
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0x2118A590
first who spoke--
0xDE602272

0x51EF4E84
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0x3B37133B
liar?"
0x81C7B19E

0x51EF4E84
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0xAAD81F32
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x98F7804C

0x51EF4E84
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xB0DC70B5

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x2FDEA363
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0x8A3430DE

0x51EF4E84
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x4E96B061

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x639B0AD5
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0xD7BAF35B
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x9853E1CF
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0xFB3ED9C6
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0x804B2F00
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x08D55831
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x1D115BE5
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x760EC904
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x1A472015

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x02DE0599
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xA070D97F

0x51EF4E84
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x92A3CAC3
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x6AE2A672
without friends."
0xDD1933A4

0x51EF4E84
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x92F57236
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x30158C98
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xE095FD1D
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x2963EE5E
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x863C2CC0
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x51049959

0x51EF4E84
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0xF881A0B8
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x15FC916F
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x58BFCF11
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x63FA4C42
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0xDAA4D0A4
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x6E8A7FAB
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x5CB8BCEB
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0x233752C5
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x46F239C0
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0xC98BBAB0
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0x90282562
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0xB4454246
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0xE2663625
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0x39FB7E6A
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0x68D2F504

0x51EF4E84
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x81A6B001
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x9888C6DC
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xB12EF985
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0x7D17E959
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0xB433953E

0x51EF4E84
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0xCD2C240E
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x3FB81369
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0xAB1536D2
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0xAEE09E2E
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0x6A9E3147
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0xD0BA8614

0x51EF4E84
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xE98F4D76
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x912EC53B

0x51EF4E84
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x5EC59DA6
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x539B340B
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0x59EE63D7
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x63F2B5BE
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0xF2ECE6D2

0x51EF4E84
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0xD5034E40
your grief away?"
0x9FF61434

0x51EF4E84
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0x3A03D62F

0x51EF4E84
"Why?"
0x66842582

0x51EF4E84
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x0DFE1499
will now think me wicked."
0x314750C1

0x51EF4E84
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0xA07B8EA0
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0x86CCB5A8

0x51EF4E84
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x6E6CB2E6

0x51EF4E84
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xBE6A0162
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0xEC7BB7D0

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0xDA3F8C6F
care."
0xA1AA6258

0x51EF4E84
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x4185060A

0x51EF4E84
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xE526AD2E
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0xC5CFC577
always keep me."
0x1C4BDFD7

0x51EF4E84
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xC4677D73
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x82A18C98
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x53BE4146
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x603347E3
exaggerate nothing."
0x299A484A

0x51EF4E84
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0xD7F5DE4C
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0x09F3BE45
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0x59C17178
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x6EAA1394
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0xEAA817A8
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x0AFBF99A
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xFA541B4F
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0xEA6052CD
Temple fully believed me.
0xEE142B33

0x51EF4E84
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0xA82E6392
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0x93C71ED9
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0xEB337BFD
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0xA587EC63
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x3225B689
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x7D2A4FA5

0x51EF4E84
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x3D2C68E9
then said--
0xF7B41E1E

0x51EF4E84
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x6AE4CF25
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x0E643D85
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0xE581FEB3

0x51EF4E84
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0xDC7A6778
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x23F274BB
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x6EE52B63
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0xDD390922
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0x0431718F

0x51EF4E84
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x0712AA45

0x51EF4E84
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x584BA967

0x51EF4E84
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x77E67E9E

0x51EF4E84
"It is a little better."
0x0E85D7BC

0x51EF4E84
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0xE382078A
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xF4CA2876
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0x6E6E82AE

0x51EF4E84
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xD9DEF6C0
rang her bell.
0x056822F7

0x51EF4E84
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x3AB5274C
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x27189CA6

0x51EF4E84
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xF42A62CF
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0xD47F6E4E
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0xAE083B10
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x11F1A645
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x63C49D3C

0x51EF4E84
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xD9549B23
There is not enough for three."
0x1E792CB8

0x51EF4E84
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xFD1C5723

0x51EF4E84
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0xC5088A9C

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x297C567F
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x838DAB08

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x4A9D46E9
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x8DAA093C
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x92B96905

0x51EF4E84
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x2186A3A2
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xBD4D0872
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0xF3A4E328
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x21942DDF

0x51EF4E84
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0x65FB186D
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0xADF9BAB9
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0xB1CC5914

0x51EF4E84
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0xDF12ADCA
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0xDE8CB0A4
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0xFC845916
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x66541695

0x51EF4E84
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xF08FB278
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0x68780C92
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0xB9AC2635

0x51EF4E84
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0xA75A995A
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x8AD8E7FA
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x92A4CEE4
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x51022754
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0xA581CE1D
struck with wonder.
0x2C818598

0x51EF4E84
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0xECBCB998
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x2FB4232F
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0x53588D5B
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0x4EC5F364
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x14836EA5
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0x70A9C667
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0xCB1F609C
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0x86AE0753
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x4CB56543
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x74D5A03F
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xD527F0D5
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0x4E4C405B
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x1A0E04CA
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x04125A7A

0x51EF4E84
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x09574849
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x1EB4895B
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x753D197E
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0xF3827E1E
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x16312DB4
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0x00F3BACA
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x1E321BBC
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x147F7008
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x100B2F0E
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xB768D456
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x58BC0A64

0x51EF4E84
"God bless you, my children!"
0xCA678117

0x51EF4E84
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0x1024EE4D
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x133CE611
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0xE4ACC3D0

0x51EF4E84
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x96C2B2F0
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x09567510
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0xC92A66B1
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x98DC0EC6
shoulder.
0xF41930A4

0x51EF4E84
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x1157A912
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0xE17E2BCF

0x51EF4E84
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x27EE05E9
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x7F118770
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0xDE561C10
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x5E0CDA57
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x4A1DA197
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0x326C78EB
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x829B7623
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x56C0F547
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0x4C238A09

0x51EF4E84
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x918D1CF0
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x0E4C7F0A
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x8A5BFC04
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x0E6924E8
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xD8DDE2E8
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x41E12A53
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0xEF4F1260
through the ranks of my companions.
0x7E53D4BA

0x51EF4E84
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x7EF02735
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0x90B98E21
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x5EA935A0
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x7B3562AF
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0xA7E41617
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x4FD9883D
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x0575BED5
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0xA7177E07
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0xB82A47E9
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0xF8B6C2E8
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x6872BCBD
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x668E1583
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0xB297B0AA
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0xB0FC2EA0
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0x8A2B1A9B
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0xC0ADA16D
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0x0ECC7EEA
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0xD60B53E5
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x48BD0062
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0x41DCFDC2
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x4EF1C2B1

0x51EF4E84
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0x721BC6B0
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER IX
0x32958A27

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x80989D06
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0xB2E7CF5B
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0x8538C733
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x04F3E178
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0xD9DE08D2
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x75FFC1EB
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0xC984DCD8
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0xFDF5B0DC
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x52CDFF4D
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0xE0964402
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x8244ECE7
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x61CA290F
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x73B3C312
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x4B9E9E5D

0x51EF4E84
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xD905FB8F
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x6323BB66
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x41DCF3CA
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0xAFAD92D2
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x267D652B
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x967802B4
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x5991C62A
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0x8685E9B8
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x8F41BD53
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0xA1B2C9C5
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0xEEC0E987
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x844C340E
of skeletons.
0x1D95DEED

0x51EF4E84
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0xFA6B1B87
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x06781E26
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x7C19C24C
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x9C6B70AE
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x456A5170
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xEA987A0E
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0x23423AE1
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xA44DAEA1
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x8820F997
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x2B816B33
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0xB5E54074
advert.
0x7043E84B

0x51EF4E84
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x33DF2A5B
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x467D3B1E
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0x7A39640C
question.
0xCE0E73A0

0x51EF4E84
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x1B3C5FC2
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xBBD72668
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x5C6A2003
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x9A7F834B
hospital.
0x3B61CF09

0x51EF4E84
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0xB649010C
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0xE987827E
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0xEC8BE8AB
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0x7736B588
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x06D5E237
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0x5167B9D9
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0xECE632C7
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x89CCEC01
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0xC4A0D005
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x9920F15C
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xBC645BD4
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x87733058
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xA31B8C77
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x050B7FC1

0x51EF4E84
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x853764A5
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0xEA52DB27
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x25AE790A
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0xDF10EFD4
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0xB63BF0F8
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0x5FDB0F3D
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0xC9480B1B
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0xA64E66B2
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x8A7A7163
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x4A160A20
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0x49361971
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0x70B3A02B

0x51EF4E84
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0xC9179E9E
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0xBDF081BB
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0xC8A4B9FD
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x48D5AB30
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xB6454FED
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x9ECAE9D2
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x2AAD4A22
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x2140BF41
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x5ADDFFF2
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x4FD97281
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x9FED74C7
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x37FD4CB4
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x3334D017

0x51EF4E84
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x27A386CB
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x03392E21
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xFA5A9DE9
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x815BA71C
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xA854DAA4
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xA33A012B
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x89E0DED8
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x3F242BAE
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x3E79223E
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0xE6CE251D
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0xCE0BF6EB
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0xD7365798
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x8D5A55DE

0x51EF4E84
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x833360CC
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0x82B3A794
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x3042C9B7
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x1A5F768C
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x0C1A0CB6
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0xB27F1A87
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x879AF95D
higher things.
0xDB885674

0x51EF4E84
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x9E427B24
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0xD0E23F8A
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x30F1A5E2
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x09957E15
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0xC02D1D86
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0xE921B05F
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x01E3D5C8
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xEBCE8B4D
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x81496452
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x3DD36641
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x37E1E69E
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x55596BC0
alleviate.
0xB8F4857E

0x51EF4E84
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0xB9C8B669
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x84F6A774
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x3D90B790
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0x7E44621A
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x7BAEF0DD
verandah.
0x8E261538

0x51EF4E84
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x465EE095
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x29C9EB94
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x68901E05
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x7794C6C5
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0xA587CB2C
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x535901AE
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x8F43FCC0
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0xB6FC0CB7
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x2636B41E
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x69001549
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x535EFB7E
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x897A6895
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xEF1EC6AC
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0xA18D69C5
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x54CFA9FE
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x0F37CCD5
done before:--
0x69F1319C

0x51EF4E84
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0xD755DB3F
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x0687635D
have to go who knows where?"
0x73ABD41B

0x51EF4E84
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x582EA975
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x970E3240
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x51EEA4D1
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0xD87F2EF8
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0xF7E6FDCC
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x974A6D88
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x377996A2
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x9F8EDF94
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x450C06B1
ran up to her.
0xFE2E98F1

0x51EF4E84
"How is Helen Burns?"
0x7408C53F

0x51EF4E84
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xEFE5C368

0x51EF4E84
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x700CE501

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"And what does he say about her?"
0x2E570DE7

0x51EF4E84
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x9F3BED30

0x51EF4E84
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xA8B84244
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x3D26D503
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0x70569674
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0xEA80D360
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xCA3ABBC2
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0x38DC2EF3
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x20175110
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x8272E022

0x51EF4E84
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0xC79CD1AB

0x51EF4E84
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x98CF8E64

0x51EF4E84
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0xD1C2ECC1
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x0C0E74C8

0x51EF4E84
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0xD77788AD
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x43736B82
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0x507D05D7

0x51EF4E84
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0xBBC3F2F6
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x835A94B1
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0xA97F1E23
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x5D4A8CD4
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x4CC9BD5D
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x36AAF507
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x4CF7E12B
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0xD3A5B366
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0xC4858A5F
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x2C33CEF5
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0xEABACCA2
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x574611C9
with her one last word.
0x73AADE10

0x51EF4E84
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0xB3FA829B
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0xE9513692
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xDA4FBA43
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0x8C6694D8
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x8B4BBF32
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0xBCB2F75C
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x2F2C4C49
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0xF6D823FE
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0xFE64213E

0x51EF4E84
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x527D97CC
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x6472F32D
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x920A789F
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x77F36F5D
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0x81F02F7F
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x6EC47A32
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0xFE40A4C0
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xA3920786
of seeing a corpse.
0xAB3ED8A9

0x51EF4E84
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0x05217520

0x51EF4E84
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x5307EE1B
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x3A3FF3B8
instantly dissipated.
0x2574F3AE

0x51EF4E84
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xB832CDB9

0x51EF4E84
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x82141DE5
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xD483CACE

0x51EF4E84
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0x7F00CDF5
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x51268860
old.
0x84EC94DD

0x51EF4E84
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0x5481A75E
strike some minutes since."
0x0F29ED61

0x51EF4E84
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0xAFD67501
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0xA9E180D4

0x51EF4E84
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xCDE0852F

0x51EF4E84
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x49F363EE

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x2242114A

0x51EF4E84
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x362A4C4F
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0xBB2A5458
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x2ED7F4F2
whispered--
0x886FF5D8

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0xF878A68A
quilt."
0xDA0D6D9A

0x51EF4E84
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xE93E1EA9
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0xB98345CB

0x51EF4E84
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xF8BE88ED
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x02346C4C
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x2918DE25
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0xBB2FD5CA
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xFF69F1D9
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x8782D5E8
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xDAFA79F6
been continually at fault."
0xF8230583

0x51EF4E84
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xDD952678

0x51EF4E84
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0x4D367017

0x51EF4E84
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x57BB3DCF

0x51EF4E84
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0xAB6E2934
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0xC115A117
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x30CB6359
reveal Him to me."
0x53BBD9FB

0x51EF4E84
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0x6E53FD5A
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xA86FE3F5

0x51EF4E84
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0x47747C21
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x0EEB47BE
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0xB8571668

0x51EF4E84
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x5CEB70C8

0x51EF4E84
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0x5D8FE283
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x55FF27E9

0x51EF4E84
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x9A68DF20
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x7D4B40ED
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x1DEC937E
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0xEDBBFB36
tone--
0x730E24B1

0x51EF4E84
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0x7CBBE152
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x4B45DCAA
near me."
0xE3B3C56B

0x51EF4E84
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0x5C67382A

0x51EF4E84
"Are you warm, darling?"
0xFC02B9E0

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Good-night, Jane."
0x46457C90

0x51EF4E84
"Good-night, Helen."
0xB744FB03

0x51EF4E84
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0x75E6792A

0x51EF4E84
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x5166F1C9
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0xD04D4361
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x680EDB94
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x7B7D2B22
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0xDDB4F83C
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0x0E1E8522
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x58CF128E
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xBF498654

0x51EF4E84
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0x2F972B9E
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x2E9DDA7D
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
0xE70E4D1B

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER X
0x6EC51A44

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0xB74CFA59
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0xCB080D29
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x6711C2B4
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x22FE5879
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x1B5FD71C
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0xE40CC6FF
connection.
0x9CA4439A

0x51EF4E84
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0x8D096576
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x9CE61C45
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x0D0EF30F
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0xD38DFD88
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0xA65D5EAE
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x214BA486
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x37ECEF1B
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0xF890A881
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0x8AF930AE
beneficial to the institution.
0x52C57C29

0x51EF4E84
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x84896940
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x12D44DF8
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x66DD2842
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0x238CC37E
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0xCFBE89F0
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0xC72E0299
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0x5C840A98
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0xC61AF17F
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0xB6E5BC03
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0xD4777007
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0xE45C065C
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xA55E0AA1
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x01AEB402
testimony to its value and importance.
0x5FF4DB68

0x51EF4E84
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0x03F3C721
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0xFF742338
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0x84BEFCE2
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x0571142B
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0x80504CD9
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0xEEBBA879
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xE73E9E9F
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xAF99CD49

0x51EF4E84
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x65E72871
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x54CAD9AE
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x2B7D8057
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0x4211672F
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x964DD962
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0xB92D55D6
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xB242722A

0x51EF4E84
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0xA7AE5B6E
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0xD0C2F088
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0x006D2003
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0xB3B56D82
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0x36E7581C
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x8EE264A7
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x9BF5D5E8
character.
0x5ACEFAB8

0x51EF4E84
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x1FAD98DB
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x397C8007
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x22CFD8CB
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0xE5C820CE
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x99FE95F6
of the occasion.
0xBCC02887

0x51EF4E84
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x8701B899
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x70655D9E
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0xEEDA8107
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xE1EB6681
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x1B8E7BC6
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0xB5C0A3CB
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x134A17E4
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x8F9BA977
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0xDD3596D5
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xADBC385D
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0x81D6CE9C
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0xB6B6D26D
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0xD7F82E5B
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x8605ED96
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x37126473
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x1ECF8455

0x51EF4E84
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0xFDFDE004
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0xFABD5CA9
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x96A7E949
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0xE23999CA
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x78A8837C
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x7643371D
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x7584B093
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x103372E0
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x1C804E84
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x3C11A625
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xCEB93EFF
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0xE1BB6C0C
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xAE889E1F
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xF1ADFFCA
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0xC36E1665
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x0F354F6F
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x07C36E69
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x0B1BF204
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0x620BA7C3
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x7694873B
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0xF4DBE089
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0x256C80FA

0x51EF4E84
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x9385A7CD

0x51EF4E84
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x80976D1A
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x7C2AE129
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0xFC997407
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0xAE15C8F7
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x9EA5BCDE
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x2B36AC96

0x51EF4E84
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x4F658F79
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0xCF8CA276
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x770B821A
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x38A56BC8
instantly revived.
0xF8061A27

0x51EF4E84
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x57FDF1AC
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x8FA76B32
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x6B1E1F2E
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0xAFAB4AD3
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x47EEF669
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x3C1816F9
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0xC8B35A67
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x29472AF5
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0xB0403CE1
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0xDA968FD5

0x51EF4E84
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0xC771CFD1
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xB259B61A
think_ again with all my might.
0xE3C3AC8A

0x51EF4E84
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0xE5348B33
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x8EBD4CDF
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0xEB6932FE
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x58308F51
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x2A562D30
their resource?"
0x6A61B9CD

0x51EF4E84
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x167639D4
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x4BC1F06A
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x82ACB7DB
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0x71C40A8A
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x4CF458C9
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0xF22F1995

0x51EF4E84
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x73F1F57B
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xA4050654
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x8894F277
_---shire Herald_."
0x3EA55B11

0x51EF4E84
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x955ACB52

0x51EF4E84
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0xBF323766

0x51EF4E84
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0x02DB9A96
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0x4677D639
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0x4AFFF4E4
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0xB526AF91
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0x917458CF

0x51EF4E84
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x5AA1DBCE
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x925FBBE3

0x51EF4E84
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0xCE9C4D47
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0x41300932

0x51EF4E84
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x0842FC1E
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x855B655F
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0xE4975E4E
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0x85B5B726
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xA9B5A92A
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0xA9BB40FD
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x80DA0297
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0xC4FCF724
shire."
0xA63C8CDA

0x51EF4E84
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0x28DE6A8F
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x128608FA
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x0F719351
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x74E03745
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0x79A4EF18
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0xBCA85783
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0x0F348412

0x51EF4E84
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x35CFE1EA
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x3804F094
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0xD79B6C69
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x1FFBCDED
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xF3CA0FB9
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xEF63FBBC
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x1A1FACD8

0x51EF4E84
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x19E487C4
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x931619B2
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x1F948F3E
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0x2C0EA1D9
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0x5FD26C8C

0x51EF4E84
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0x00354A9D

0x51EF4E84
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x3E71B802
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x5E670508
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x8E25BEF1
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0x48F7EDA0
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0x900C706A

0x51EF4E84
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0x9693DE39

0x51EF4E84
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x312BA85A
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x04CDDEB5
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xAF675B24

0x51EF4E84
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x7ECECA50
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x433E4337
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x0119F967
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x04DA6AD8
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x8D1E36F2
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x74E86068
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0xE9BA87EF
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x0C6393A3
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0xC0F36F89
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x18C4C388

0x51EF4E84
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x0A7EB81D
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0xD55ACAD7
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0xD1F4BC5D
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0x9B33367D
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0xF2EDB517
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0xEC77B04E
direction:--
0xFBDEFB56

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x37302863

0x51EF4E84
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0xC8AEDCB0
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x03DD04E1
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0xDB047E67
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0xF665A6F9
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0xD43D0721
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0xB71FF919
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xDA1DEB01
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0x25344ADD
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x849FC57C
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x4960B368
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x2E63C28A
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0xBCEC2DDA
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0xECF14A8A
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x1FD5F6A3
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x64CEE188
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xC7046F7C
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xA07C76F9
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0xB8E0970F
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xBF66D592
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x8F1F6124

0x51EF4E84
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x1EBF2E61

0x51EF4E84
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0x0E013437
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x273E0F52
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0xCCC05A51
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xF71A666D
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x63850875
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x208ABFFF
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0xA0D35FC1
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x2E69F59C
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0xDE2C7433
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x209B33F6
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x0F8E9993
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x4A17EA13
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0x6CC81B8D
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0xC884B81A
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0x1B17639B
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0xAE764662
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x9A8AE0B1
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0x7DAF0234
forthwith be furnished me.
0x2B51578A

0x51EF4E84
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x6884C615
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x4BB26688
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x5BBF9BBB
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0xBFEE817C

0x51EF4E84
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0x0044ED8F
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x18A08AE0
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0xD8769105
years ago from Gateshead.
0x49CF2E4C

0x51EF4E84
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0xEE6DB33F
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0xE79F1BFC
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x39B37E9F
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x715A4DB8
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x6ACCE0FA
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0xE92A0662
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0xE30BAD68
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xAA3915AD
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x51CD90AD
while the change was being accomplished.
0xBE6D48A5

0x51EF4E84
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0xD83DFDC6
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0xCEA884E5

0x51EF4E84
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xBA268EEA
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0xF2086113
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0xAB8FAACA

0x51EF4E84
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0xD71F0585
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0x1AFB492F

0x51EF4E84
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0xA341D7A3
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x7A93CC30
complexion.
0x6EB5FB7B

0x51EF4E84
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x3ECD5284
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x47A83444

0x51EF4E84
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0xFC019221
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x54759BE8
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x0745E112
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x047EA2AF

0x51EF4E84
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x4C9D4C3D

0x51EF4E84
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x3195F301

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0xF4233862
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x8ECF3AB8

0x51EF4E84
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x343B700D

0x51EF4E84
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0x725B1E4E

0x51EF4E84
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x2D470E12
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x58A5A4D0
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x75CD4AF4

0x51EF4E84
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0xCD9CE8AB
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0xDFF68942
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xCC4745D1
would make two of you in breadth."
0x3991AAF9

0x51EF4E84
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xDBBF4EBF

0x51EF4E84
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x7E171412
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0x04AB38E4
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0x1DCB3020
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x685643FF
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x69BF750C
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0x40491755
quarrelling--"
0xD75C1E6E

0x51EF4E84
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x2DAA1579

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0x88B31EB5
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x0C963052
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0x252DFB0A
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0x358EC931

0x51EF4E84
"What does he look like?"
0xD1EC7B90

0x51EF4E84
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x5010476C
has such thick lips."
0xA3D71246

0x51EF4E84
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x364525EF

0x51EF4E84
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x288A15D6
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0xB9BE737A
a deal of money."
0x3633D217

0x51EF4E84
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x79AC9A26

0x51EF4E84
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x20B47DE9
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0xDD111817
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x628FB406
you were quite out of my reach."
0x433FC028

0x51EF4E84
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x233F456D
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xF05B0D49
shape denote admiration.
0x9CAF50B8

0x51EF4E84
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x703E627B
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x612466DC
a child."
0x06FE5495

0x51EF4E84
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x5F32BB30
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0xE4C8B397
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0xCB8C7E27
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x2372F1E2

0x51EF4E84
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0xB2F90DA2
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x70D98E87

0x51EF4E84
"A little."
0xFB0D6913

0x51EF4E84
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0xF8249EAB
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x303F56B0
charmed.
0xE1575A0B

0x51EF4E84
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0x35389A84
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0xD9AAF8D2

0x51EF4E84
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xFDCD0FC5
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0xDAB7FC6D
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x8E8E9B56
and which she had framed and glazed.
0x77752B39

0x51EF4E84
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0xC839ED2E
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0xB143486F
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x131E2805

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x7A3F2AE6

0x51EF4E84
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0xA90F68BF

0x51EF4E84
"I can."
0x3A91D69E

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0x2088A1F4
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x6D851C88
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0xDCD81DF9
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x83199058

0x51EF4E84
"Never in my life."
0x21D93FDB

0x51EF4E84
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x3C7C7273
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x53DCFDE5
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0xA2C5C085
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0x5C38F5A5
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0xED921A09
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0x050BD5C0
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0xFCE0B28F
father's brother."
0x9F6E590C

0x51EF4E84
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x2287F3D2

0x51EF4E84
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x4E369AC5
tell me--"
0xEA5FCE7D

0x51EF4E84
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0xAA55CF2D

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0x5FC66186

0x51EF4E84
"So he went?"
0x801A15CB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0xAAC085F6
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0xB1EC6F89
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0x9586A5DC

0x51EF4E84
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0xD3C69A54
wine-merchant."
0xB4856526

0x51EF4E84
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x5AA346EC
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0xEC48FEC0
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0xEC413CE5
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0x78531A9D
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x5B4C0CBF
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x40B0F98D
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x5A82C7BB

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XI
0xDD46DD29

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0xE807474B
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x655D490C
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x563CC8D2
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x8A29B279
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x5FA4B6D7
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x26260760
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0xE9D3DF4B
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xB4265FCB
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xF2685FD9
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x8CD73D58
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xE46F1BD4
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x79542B3A

0x51EF4E84
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0x20F279AB
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x85359D3A
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0xD7196D4D
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x71B66D94
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x2180BE3D
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x1E3427E8
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0xE558BA10
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x86561B33
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0x1D2E68BC
troubling my thoughts.
0x04429A71

0x51EF4E84
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x45C03E94
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0xFCD22FEE
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0xF88FF19E
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0xCDEC0216
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x3AC06EDB
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x6E6F8D17
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x0F0A4153
the bell.
0xD4ACF15F

0x51EF4E84
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x4A2306A3
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x0E9FA76D

0x51EF4E84
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0xED6287F3
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0xF4E8CFD0

0x51EF4E84
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0xCD7A3570

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Person here waiting for you."
0x0926130E

0x51EF4E84
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0xCCE13A91
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0xEE034782
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0xC3E25AAD

0x51EF4E84
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x0E44D3EB
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0xBBCCEFFE

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x35DE3980
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xDC5CE2DB
Thornfield.
0x4B2DFA1D

0x51EF4E84
"A matter of six miles."
0x295BAF36

0x51EF4E84
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x00E4EE98

0x51EF4E84
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x06E49D89

0x51EF4E84
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0xF6083350
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0xC088C50B
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0xB7130A2E
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x6C4A5B96
much at my ease.
0x98B7DA1A

0x51EF4E84
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0x4FA7FE7D
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0xEF78D44C
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x3979F176
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0xD37E92DC
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xE7F100DF
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0xE7291F8A
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x4795A08C
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0xEA325C91
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0xE33A75CA
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0xCCA007CD
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x32FC49F1
road now, I wonder?"
0x2E67DABD

0x51EF4E84
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x09998C39
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x792AB03B
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0xFCD9095E
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0xB43C33AB
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x0327772F
more stirring, less romantic.
0x3EAC5614

0x51EF4E84
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x817F65B4
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x84121FC3
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x2FF65ABF

0x51EF4E84
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0xAE31A952

0x51EF4E84
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x47F57CD4
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0xD5915F1D
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0xBEE2F62E
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x38857CA1
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x926957E1
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0xA4F0C9E3
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x3C26CF60
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x424C48A1

0x51EF4E84
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x5AE2DCA1
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0xFA41305A
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x0B4AC36A
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x9216AEBA
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x5DB8151B
itself to my view.
0xA9B71BF4

0x51EF4E84
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x848BECF1
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x146264DC
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0x3CA51F84
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x11179E7D
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x3E90281B
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0xB92E59B9
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x30AA2A2C
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xB764C456
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x776F6BA5
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x72EA7196

0x51EF4E84
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xE0789A61
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x1A166955

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0xEA2C1C93

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xFDE820D2

0x51EF4E84
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0xA80A9E28
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x99B79AF8
trouble.
0xA1CD0638

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0xFD3BEE70
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x19D87B7B
the keys of the storeroom."
0x23AFF907

0x51EF4E84
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x18D3CBEB
delivered them to the servant.
0xCB23DF2A

0x51EF4E84
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0xCDBB9BE6
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x96DEDDD9

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, ma'am."
0x4168FCD0

0x51EF4E84
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0x2728A27D

0x51EF4E84
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xDD1EF912
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x6E4EC9C1
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x1AFDC42B
too soon."
0xB76BC4D7

0x51EF4E84
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x118A6D3E
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x1B7339B4
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x0F782C8B
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0x6C7BD6A6
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0xDE662D75
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x924574EA
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xC38A3B91

0x51EF4E84
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0xBE1325A1
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0xEA89534B

0x51EF4E84
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xA288C668
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0xAE76BCA1

0x51EF4E84
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x1CB37288

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0x3C5968FA
future pupil."
0x3CC131B9

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xE031494C

0x51EF4E84
"No,--I have no family."
0x48C30F6A

0x51EF4E84
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x8CFC9C64
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0xA8FDDA61
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0xFB1A272E

0x51EF4E84
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x23B49049
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xD3C9EC9B
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0xCB6157CF
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0xBDA08980
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0xB7DA1BB7
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0xBE25EBAD
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x2C3F7809
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0x87A3A78B
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0xEF2688B1
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x33603CBF
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x3783149E
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x9B020E6C
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0x78501565
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x61F9A324
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0x2EBE93C7
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x8C137B5B
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x8AAED669
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x0D9CD3A0
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xA4046C20

0x51EF4E84
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x1D8E4E11
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x45E2AB31
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0x4CD250FC

0x51EF4E84
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x208F2EBF
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0xBB6F6CED
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xEF46955D
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0xA31E234C
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x9F3783FF
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0x32A6510F
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xA9982886

0x51EF4E84
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0xD4F51A6B
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x27CFB0B6
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0xB52DA697
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xF575A651
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0xFA87A6AF
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0x463A2EFF
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0xB1BA7332
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0xCCABF179
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x761E51AF
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0x44CED260
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x8E18963E

0x51EF4E84
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x01B152EC
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x2E2F9586
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xEF00349B
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0xA2AE0FEF
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xD745D7BF
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xC0460A3C
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x4E37E699
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0xD4534E40
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0xFD636C74
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xC5590284
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x35772BDA
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x895EB03E

0x51EF4E84
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x3B8DBFAE
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x522BD027
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x55E0EA14
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0xB8ABF8B4
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xB28BB6A7
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0x3058AF45
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0xCF46BF2A
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0x3B5E96E4
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x58272E2A
an indefinite future period.
0xC98A17A0

0x51EF4E84
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0xE944183C
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0xACC2AFD1
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0x8BDB71AF
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0x7057EE68
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x00CF71C2
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0xE3DFCC84
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xA4DD672E
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0xD4C8D14C
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0xE2D8E78F
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0x2BCA3E7D
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x9A25253F
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x50715F80
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x624C5878
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0xDF765D89
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xE8E0E302
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0xE19FD73B
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0x351CC4B6
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x3F4077BD
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x249DD3A1

0x51EF4E84
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0x967223DB
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0x057AC56D
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0xFE7BBDE3
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0xF6CA86A3
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0xF378BAE8
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xAD46EC86
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x085C16B0
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x7DD7CDEE
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x3F8C31B4
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0xB10D8DEE
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x02A53032
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0xA5D1940C
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x25A6B904
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x85451F40
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x8A9A18D2
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x3CE09751
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x1845ED9E
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x855FBECA
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0x7D9935BB
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x0F19DF61
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0x7E5A37FE
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0xF25A4171
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0xF2748B59
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0xFDE9CE12
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0x2F0A242F
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x262271AE
house and gates.
0x79C8EE56

0x51EF4E84
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x12AB562B
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0xE3C183D3
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0xA878EF54
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xB8035D60
appeared at the door.
0xD638ACB1

0x51EF4E84
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x1FBFA80E
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0xA08FEE89

0x51EF4E84
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0xF43BFD29
much.
0x71478DA8

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x048DA143
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xD63F4DD2
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0xA6BF0DB4
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x5DA0C390

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x61FCAC4D

0x51EF4E84
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x3546CEE9
was called Rochester?"
0x94A1B63B

0x51EF4E84
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0x6ECD7FCD
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0xCEFD0F7A
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x87B31F5B

0x51EF4E84
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x9CB24622

0x51EF4E84
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x90BF4FF0
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0xF3C46BBB
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0xDC7AA854
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x43702127
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x2C43C8D9
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x6A83370B
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x63538FB4
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0x59984624
expect nothing more."
0x6CF060CE

0x51EF4E84
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0xB2A32C0F

0x51EF4E84
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x775B94E3
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0xD2AAACCC
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x17C79128
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x9CA73CCD
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xE4DE7FF7
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xC21A575F
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x51A21F39
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x542BE0B9

0x51EF4E84
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x88058B28
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x6F3B53D7
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0xA6018C9B
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0xE09186B0
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x09314F3D

0x51EF4E84
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x07819CF2
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0xF7FF30EE
approached.
0x19F07738

0x51EF4E84
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x7F0C71F7
nurse; who answered--
0x90929ECF

0x51EF4E84
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x0C8F7B5D

0x51EF4E84
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0x92063D3B

0x51EF4E84
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x4C91C8BF
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xD0DF9829
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x4F22189A
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x1746651B
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0xE9A0B0D2

0x51EF4E84
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x2AF23D57
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x020A26F0
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x139BB602
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x97A28DB4
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x4FEA8175
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x7AAB0224
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x9E5D0400
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0xF699591B
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0xE4AEF4F9
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0x8324B6A1
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0x3C45C938
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0xFD34C001

0x51EF4E84
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x8929C418
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x14883534
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x0B4F3330
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0xF90AA6A5
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0xC5BAF085
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0xCD2A3A8C
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x874DA909
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0xBB54D683
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x061954D6

0x51EF4E84
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x44068609

0x51EF4E84
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x5783BFFD
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x8DBBAA82
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xC53B0502
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0xE7EC9EB5
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0xC8F5828A
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xE70B7B9D
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x48FDC91D
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0xAEB16D9E
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x676AF6E5
fed with crumbs."
0xB9C8CC7C

0x51EF4E84
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0xB1FDE6A5

0x51EF4E84
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0xF10DA6F9
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x3360E182

0x51EF4E84
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0xAF71A1B8
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0xD0924AD6

0x51EF4E84
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x3595CA54
clean town you spoke of?"
0x46564E5B

0x51EF4E84
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0x9CF9FE29
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x41107F11
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x514627F8
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xD6336B26
hear me sing now?"
0x90C0D8EB

0x51EF4E84
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x0EA0C46D
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x5F3CE1F1
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0xEA81D5F7
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x2ABFD150
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x96C0F12C
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0xED7D97D4
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x5CF4ACBC
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0xA6F5E401
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x786B1011
affected her.
0x6DC5C1F5

0x51EF4E84
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x760B4D50
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x3C4449A0
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x1DED0B31
at least I thought so.
0x862B36A8

0x51EF4E84
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0xB90CF696
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x7E0A6696
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x07484BC4

0x51EF4E84
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0x41E5A47B
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0x6D066AE2
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x8BA56246
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x6831F4AE
carefully trained.
0xEED715B2

0x51EF4E84
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x08112B7B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0x87EE21EA
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x16979917
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xE710FA63

0x51EF4E84
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x31D3C228
say, with whom did you live then?"
0x5DDC38CF

0x51EF4E84
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xDA5091EB
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x98766436
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x523F87D5
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x248635FC
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x62E5CC30
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0xB28ED579
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0xEC92D73A
and I never see him."
0x312D2E10

0x51EF4E84
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xF4588B04
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x26783BC0
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0xEB366A34
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0xE4F46C9B
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xC6C04D61
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x27362FD3
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x9C6144D6
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x53032C27
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0xF66181FB
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x33B00209
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0xB78F0E86
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x984E0C29

0x51EF4E84
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0xDF70BFAD
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0xE3E34DDE
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x277E00A4
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0xE9B88E02
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x35F41165
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0xCB1A47FF
use.
0x53320040

0x51EF4E84
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x3BD93D32
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0x74F493FE
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0xB0AF938C
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x493DEF5E
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0xC83FBB1D
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x8D5F0262
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x1857E788
sideboard.
0x36DD7D45

0x51EF4E84
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x88A400B3
before seen any half so imposing.
0x852024EB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x77BC82B5
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0xD459FB6C
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0xCE68967E

0x51EF4E84
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0xB448AAB2
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x982921A6
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0xA69EF7AF
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x05B64C67
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x59A8FDD9
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x0B9C952C
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0xB629A516
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0xAC8B9EFD
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0xDE6100C9
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x9B8A0902
general blending of snow and fire.
0x7094BC76

0x51EF4E84
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x15AF3BD9
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x65312A65
were inhabited daily."
0xEB89BDC3

0x51EF4E84
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x8716C6C7
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0x92C35559
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x90E861C6
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0x63171F21

0x51EF4E84
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x94466A3A

0x51EF4E84
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0xE39F01EB
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x4330828C

0x51EF4E84
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0xDFACC48D

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x8FE51C48
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x3C5AB2D5
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x1D95064F

0x51EF4E84
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xD98134A4
liked for himself?"
0xF8EDD856

0x51EF4E84
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0xD9AC1422
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x2B3F2B53
lived much amongst them."
0x174DFF33

0x51EF4E84
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0xBACDFE34

0x51EF4E84
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x5A2BA5A4
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x72ACBB49
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0xC44A721D
conversation with him."
0xE8F19244

0x51EF4E84
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x1BC0283A

0x51EF4E84
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xDCDD7AF2
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x29E8BBD3
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x6040E434
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0xF42F4093
he is a very good master."
0x9ECE1A07

0x51EF4E84
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0xF40AEF9B
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0xA1BD5F04
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0xA8B03E94
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x7FAC85E5
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x5D62D448
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x1AAC6644
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x6F20CD2D
definite notion of his identity.
0x68FED454

0x51EF4E84
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0x0377D227
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x238641BA
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0x04B71E4C
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x4B84AF55
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x314558CA
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x954296CD
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x2559E95D
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x32555091
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0xDA236ED2
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0xFC6FA41D
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0x32719412
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0xCEBCAA4D
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x89E6240F
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0xBDC497B7
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0xCE9BB979
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0xDAC5E0DF
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x425317B1
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0xFB310ACD
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x5195AE3B
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x1F44E21F
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0xBB62B837

0x51EF4E84
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0xC5FF2450

0x51EF4E84
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x2F56D9CF
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0xF78D8BFC
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0xE799AC67

0x51EF4E84
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x45BA8664

0x51EF4E84
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0xE3D16031

0x51EF4E84
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x7F0D01E7

0x51EF4E84
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0x46A81420
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xCB33785D
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xBBCEC870

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x4053E7AD
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x0C5626EF

0x51EF4E84
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0xE22ED28E
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x8CF1EC41
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x57AA8A65
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x5BCF5154
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x2BBF4F0F
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x03703C85
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x710577F4
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0xD87DC223
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0x50248510
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x822795D7
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x77CBBE1E
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x8F43959E
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x9E44CEF6
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x8192F7F8
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0xD6659BD6
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x9A936932
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0xEBD454A3

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x76BFABB1
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x9646D089
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0xB5D462D0
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x1A45192A
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0xA297A169
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x00B09C29
Bluebeard's castle.
0x331EA901

0x51EF4E84
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0xFE2F2065
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x6F151BAD
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x745D7FDF
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0xDE6CF930
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x50853380
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x7D156BE7
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x3C0D39A7

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0x28369CB3
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0xCD1B57D4

0x51EF4E84
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0x83F62419

0x51EF4E84
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0x1B414F01

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x68D3F5DF
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x6D9CD12E

0x51EF4E84
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x5EB6E984
odd murmur.
0x618925B9

0x51EF4E84
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x37028BD4

0x51EF4E84
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0xE6F60D45
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x84DB576F
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0xB2C924D2
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0xCEF5B096
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xEFD4322C
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0xDBBD680E

0x51EF4E84
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0xB539418A
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0xB7591AD1
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0x83C06EE0
be conceived.
0x1DD2F8D6

0x51EF4E84
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xB5150032
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xF236D46C

0x51EF4E84
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x62E526C0
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0xCB910C26
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0x6EA49854
pupil this morning?"
0xF2F97B32

0x51EF4E84
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0xF5AA032C
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x016BC82B
hall, exclaiming--
0xD5F3A086

0x51EF4E84
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0xBC8FDA67

0x51EF4E84
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
0x2B606C47

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XII
0xDACE0BC6

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0xE52C0CBB
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x48D3970A
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0xC37EC6D6
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0xD7DBA5C0
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0x74C2CBE8
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0x1AE619A0
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x878EDB86
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x31819111
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0xE1FD59FD
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x2850735C
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0x09D7D238
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x41A1854C
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x2ED68760
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x347F7211
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0xBB5C85CE
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x4DD942D5

0x51EF4E84
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x9693B32E
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x1E1BB5AD
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0xE34B18E6
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0xAE977840
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0x5971185C
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0x5DCB56EA
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x3284FB9D
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0xC013E8EA
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x741F3D90
of her mind and character.
0x6E565915

0x51EF4E84
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x2D2AFD01
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x6DCD894C
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x299407C4
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x97EB8CBF
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xC244C9EB
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x7BAA031D
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x6A0C59FD
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0xFB19C945
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x7872005B
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0xCD4037C7
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x7045473F
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0xA345B958
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x43AA14F0
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0x5BDF694B

0x51EF4E84
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x5FA6B5D8
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x65D52C7C
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x3F28ECDB
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x3F531B39
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x67B32F3C
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x7F79BE0B
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0xA313E2F0
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0xFF3CFA2F
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x583E8EEB
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0x197ECC38
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x8F3740CF

0x51EF4E84
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x9B889CC2
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x50576E30
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x5F0F62AF
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0xF8AC4043
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0xAAA597FA
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x00C7651D
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x36620766
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0xA25BCED3
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xE06F8069
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x0D612B41
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0xDB56303A
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x65F38BCC
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0xBC63E87D
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0xBBEFCEE6

0x51EF4E84
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0xB39AEB9E
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0xB3D493D2
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x502CAF42
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0xED0B622E
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0x9686F66D
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x2A3288C9
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0xB92989AF
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0xEC74D343
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0x05E8EE2E
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x743955D5
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0xFA9DDCDF
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xD99F17AC
every effort of that sort.

0x51EF4E84
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0xF10E0E76
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x17E50380
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x47AF3BB6
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x3B9762F7
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0x3093813B
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0xB3EE9F2C

0x51EF4E84
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0xD109D347
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0xB58F8B25
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x29887B95
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x6DD1F57D
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0xC26838E4
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0x84BA5E44
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x07EFECC3
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0xE168767A
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0xCD2EE854
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x2FFE8D14
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xABF013E6
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0xC5ECCC1A
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0x19B59A89
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x9E8436B4
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0xE2FA2D07

0x51EF4E84
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x761FF853
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xC319BBDC
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x3189CE5C
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x42F42B47
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x6BD2440C
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0x4F848DE1
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0x5927C36E
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xE67E46AB
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0x07CCCE52
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x56E88084
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0xC66A9F0F
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x50A3208B
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x1CE9F99A
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0xC7F7DB6A
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x53B031BB

0x51EF4E84
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x0F06A664
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xA497823E
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x701A7D3E
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0xB74EE480
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x111080CB
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x2A767DF8
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x6654AE63
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0x71A6F4C4
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xFB054B44
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0xEC6CD709

0x51EF4E84
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0xBA37EC48
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x2CF12669
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0xCAB72276
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x38C6B04B
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x0F811C49
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xC82CCB61
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x01E33339
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0x73CC2093

0x51EF4E84
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x4CA4B7E5
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0xCD628EA7
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x85BF65C2
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x1294A95E
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0x98FA6282
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0xA1B8F650

0x51EF4E84
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0xFD137E3E
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x06BBFAFF
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xD76789F6
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x2A7F4DFE
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0x6E52054A
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x6D5ABAFA
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0x031E3BC9
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0xC602BEA1
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xA3AA93E6
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0xF8B9B68B
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xA91CF521
me.
0x75545466

0x51EF4E84
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x4B8E3929
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x90D8C417
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0xBBEE3614
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x4EE47CBA
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x0AF83A51
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x1F8F7419
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x0BF17E83
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xF7CB0BC1
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x49B6E8FD
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0x00509681
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x2A0F83C9
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x7632073B
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0xA7305922
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xF0B6F306
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x5226D36C
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0xBA8E7C62
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x570BBEEA
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x0888FAA9
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0xC575BC27
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0xD8ABE2BC
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0xB990F529
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x6881D946
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x11310674

0x51EF4E84
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x2A2BC0DC

0x51EF4E84
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x8AD14F31
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0x2E2DF3D4

0x51EF4E84
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x56D7A3EE

0x51EF4E84
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x227D95AB
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0x386A4878
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xF18E1185
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x4E3D01A1
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x3DE4CC1F
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0xD933C5FE
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x53F16B70
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x76ED556C
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x7B755FD9

0x51EF4E84
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x02F87D05
now drew near him again.
0x38814962

0x51EF4E84
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xC7B7F876
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xD56CBE9D

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0x85D6A8EA
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x962BEB93
involuntary "Ugh!"
0x459A6883

0x51EF4E84
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x5BB8613C
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xAE6A0F1F
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x44E012FE
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x3F81B5EE
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x911F1860
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x6513C88C
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x4683D488
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x1FF91C94
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0xB7B980ED
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0xE5ED2CA7
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x54CF1F06
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0xDB1443C4
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0xB941167B
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x7884D5A2
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0xC0846BDA
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0xB3E70C59

0x51EF4E84
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x3A0387E1
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0x9C83B5F2
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x5845CE26
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0x1F8EBB35
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x24B12EF8

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0x717C0AA7
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0x4E8E18BB

0x51EF4E84
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x3EDEB0BB
direction before.
0x21E6F2C5

0x51EF4E84
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0xA9A5D2C4
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x6C82A67F

0x51EF4E84
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x4C3125B4
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0x034CAEF1
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0x49C62BE6

0x51EF4E84
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x782DBF18
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0xA05E77C3
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x3A834C8B
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0xF873D560

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Whose house is it?"
0xD58283C2

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester's."
0xB994E984

0x51EF4E84
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0xCECE38F4

0x51EF4E84
"No, I have never seen him."
0xA6816397

0x51EF4E84
"He is not resident, then?"
0x3BE0247D

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x3B1D3FA2

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot."
0xED583675

0x51EF4E84
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x841BA5FD
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0xF429FE5A
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0xC813CFB1
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x8694338C

0x51EF4E84
"I am the governess."
0x96ADA3E8

0x51EF4E84
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0xB79D0322
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x7105EFAD
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x12DA7EE5

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x6F60C4BD
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0xB055CA32

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0xC7FE0A84

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0xD3D8E742
afraid?"
0x58EC6F62

0x51EF4E84
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0xAAD7B554
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0xA2F1A836
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xFA805BAE
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0xD4C51348
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x15B92D0E
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xCF9F38A3
he laughed.
0xA0B2A040

0x51EF4E84
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0x4B45A0D9

0x51EF4E84
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xAE58F654
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0xDAA030BA
come here."
0x4C913319

0x51EF4E84
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x8BAAC0F0
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xF2D826A0
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0xFD0BE125
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0x37FE7912
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x68882C3D

0x51EF4E84
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x0D5F7BFF
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x88C6A762

0x51EF4E84
I sought it and found it.
0xAC1D558A

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0x7FBFB1BC
you can."
0xC2AEEE8D

0x51EF4E84
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0xEC6F69AE
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xE6A7030B

0x51EF4E84
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x5AF7062A
   The wild wind whirls away."
0x1DB1481D

0x51EF4E84
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x0ADEB3B0
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0xAA37BDDC
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x7B5C5460
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xF30A3641
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0x462CD627
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x98237B90
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0xF2A71888
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0xB8FE27C7
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x921FCE4D
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0xFE008560
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0xA5259081
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0xD70DC716
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0xD111DF38
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x04671451
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x96FC37B8
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0xAFF6F3A7
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x1D3E3DD8
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x86DE8BE4
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xD1405E7D
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0x6EC5F55B

0x51EF4E84
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x9C249FE4
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xD32921B7
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0x466AE837
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x4566C5E9
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0xC2D493B5
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x57DF8AFB
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xDCC88E91
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x5A19748D
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x32A3D803
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x09AF632F
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x92D28D28
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x205173A1
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x0115912D
as it would be under his.
0x0C4E8150

0x51EF4E84
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xA9B82E08
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0xA3F988F7
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0x181F4F4E
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0xBD3CEEDF
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x26E9F968
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0x577233D2
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x5A4F9C88
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xDA32FA37
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xF8776B15
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xB6662FFF
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x5B8474C8
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0x778CA9E6
door, and went in.
0x894E3FFB

0x51EF4E84
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x150842F1
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0xFE797916
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0xD7A5E23F
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x43032C0E
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0xBF42CB3E
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x8C79DCB0
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x4CA2BF35
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0xFA4ECD86
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x392E4EB0

0x51EF4E84
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0xAC60862C
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x61D073AA
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x5D88E1DD
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0xEB2A925E
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x15BE1074
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0xAD742505
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0xDB18C9A0
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x3D15F8F0
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0xDFE16997

0x51EF4E84
"What dog is this?"
0xFB9AC343

0x51EF4E84
"He came with master."
0xF70701AE

0x51EF4E84
"With whom?"
0xF08C1E3D

0x51EF4E84
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x1EE36DC0

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xF6EF6F99

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0xF2F499C8
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x1E21AED5
sprained."
0x37ECCFF0

0x51EF4E84
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x91322671

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x3CC60F9E

0x51EF4E84
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0x6BF6BF26

0x51EF4E84
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0x1B77DEA4
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0xC95B893F
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x6AA57CE7
upstairs to take off my things.
0x77DE3D09

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XIII
0xBFCFB4CF

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x44B1854A
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0xF99B8322
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xDF2B3808
and waiting to speak with him.
0x86DBC1C8

0x51EF4E84
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0xCA7DF51A
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x18EA38C2
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xADBD57F5
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x838CDFDC
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0xE7524C72
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0xF43AEE3B
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0xFFCAA79E
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0xE14D8092
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x078CBC0B

0x51EF4E84
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x81F6F9CE
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x3D658321
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x6FB9C728
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0xC6C8FB7D
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0xC8ADC1AD
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x3E3BC2E2
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0xF8022F08
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x46927B41
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0xA7BEA800
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0xEEA220FE
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0xD6F5BC3B

0x51EF4E84
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0xD1164C72
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x724DFC3D
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0xC4140A33
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x64F23301
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x30749171

0x51EF4E84
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0x5B68CF9C
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x1CA01F37
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x8FB2EE6F
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0xE503C6F8
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x7346B97C
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x1642EE6F
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0x547CAC68
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xB24BDA88
fireside.
0xC524218A

0x51EF4E84
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x475B3FD3
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x55C2CD39
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x9A41DBCD
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0x61774D6B
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0xF10C06A2

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0x58035D5F
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x77CF8958
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x59EEE6A9

0x51EF4E84
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xFCFFF531

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x34E61DAB
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x023D7A50
candle."
0xD2F3FCD8

0x51EF4E84
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x7CF918DF

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x3B203118
is here."
0xA4546891

0x51EF4E84
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0x98879663
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0xF9660B77
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0xEAF5B06E
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0xE75DF3A7
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0x068AEA17

0x51EF4E84
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x81A87F33
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0x32EC8E8F
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x1AF8DF93
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xA339977D
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0xFA117336
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x4008C0E1
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x46F2C753

0x51EF4E84
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x374AF8F4
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x7E4BCB6F
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x7CB728FB
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x9FFA58D8
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x77BF71AE
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0x27FB5C61
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x675CCA01
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x9263D626
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0xDC00DA3D
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0xADF43D13
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0xDF9C1AD7
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x78775BAF
neither tall nor graceful.
0xE0EB2410

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x173D8CD8
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0x93D5DFD8
lifted his head as we approached.
0x92B6E25F

0x51EF4E84
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0x9F06A9D7
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0x6608853A

0x51EF4E84
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0xDD653C79
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0xC2F394A3
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0xC43D21DB
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0x099768BD

0x51EF4E84
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x5E6E75AB
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0xB2F521A9
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x33B5F6F9
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x1508D9D9
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0x0335732F
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0xD9DBAC58

0x51EF4E84
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xBC83BD7D
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0xCAC0D1B4
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0x9DFFA01C
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0xB5AB3EDF
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x74096A15
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0xAD7C0C01

0x51EF4E84
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x45198383
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0xA1C2EE21
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x97759F43
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xAD3C7F82

0x51EF4E84
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x90AE6DD8
might perhaps spill it."
0x53419160

0x51EF4E84
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x7C5D1C24
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x7BC06359

0x51EF4E84
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x9421DFFC
votre petit coffre?"
0x14F635D0

0x51EF4E84
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x1EBED9F0
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0xE51290F8
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x901A7523

0x51EF4E84
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x6FE8C862
thought pleasant things."
0x883EC263

0x51EF4E84
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x76FB7CC4

0x51EF4E84
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x12D14BD6
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x3E643B07
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xBF730B10
nature."
0x3AF7734B

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0xD74D0ED7
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0xB79737A8

0x51EF4E84
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x121BC1CD
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x09B299DF
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0xF8BA0ADF
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x9B5FE7A7
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x89E03592

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x37302297
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xCF912708
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0x77FAEB7B

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x6130A3E5
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x1E90BE92

0x51EF4E84
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x74CAAC8F

0x51EF4E84
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x7C7D7FF9
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0xC3A161E2
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x4ED69D1E
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xAFBFDF63
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x84EE608B
amuse herself with Pilot.
0xD4C81893

0x51EF4E84
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0xC7E74E52

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And you came from--?"
0x8AACAF82

0x51EF4E84
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xA5D2EA89

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x6AAFE72E

0x51EF4E84
"Eight years."
0xBAECB0D8

0x51EF4E84
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x185479C2
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x683B791F
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0x06A97C1F
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0xCFACFC28
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x4839C73E
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0x6FEC44CB

0x51EF4E84
"I have none."
0x46A8983C

0x51EF4E84
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x548121A3

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0x97D77094
that stile?"
0xB571703E

0x51EF4E84
"For whom, sir?"
0x08166903

0x51EF4E84
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x9857790A
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0x50B4A36F
causeway?"
0xAFC4E1A7

0x51EF4E84
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xDF29FD02
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0xEBB90E66
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x4EC56DF0
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x817589B8
revels more."
0x8BCA5F43

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xBB011090
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x0F785E75

0x51EF4E84
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0xA2C1473F
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0xED6ED4E2

0x51EF4E84
"No; none that I ever saw."
0x0AD27AFF

0x51EF4E84
"And your home?"
0x7389E302

0x51EF4E84
"I have none."
0x46A8983C

0x51EF4E84
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x8F957A07

0x51EF4E84
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0xE10A4998

0x51EF4E84
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0x12F76CF7

0x51EF4E84
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xEBE6537D

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x24EC3032
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x33E4885D
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x83174EB3
Adele."
0x3A2EFD67

0x51EF4E84
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x6B95C731
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x4FADCFF4
felling my horse."
0x507CBC76

0x51EF4E84
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x5BC9FBBF

0x51EF4E84
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0x82941DD1

0x51EF4E84
The widow looked bewildered.
0x289FA71D

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x1700FB7E

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir."
0x2F5C6E86

0x51EF4E84
"Have you seen much society?"
0x69540410

0x51EF4E84
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0xD2EB8291
Thornfield."
0xA74ECBCC

0x51EF4E84
"Have you read much?"
0xD58FAFD6

0x51EF4E84
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0x53F27F69
very learned."
0x29DB1211

0x51EF4E84
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x06008BE2
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0x9BC98417
parson, is he not?"
0xE42A05B9

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0x03677F3E
would worship their director."
0x5BD0AA82

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, no."
0xCBD7581D

0x51EF4E84
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x70442916
sounds blasphemous."
0x33218FC3

0x51EF4E84
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x3E6B6F06
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x4B00AD80
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0xDDE2C1DC
hardly sew."
0x7AF967A8

0x51EF4E84
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x1502D2F1
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0x44254D81

0x51EF4E84
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0xE5472640
Rochester.
0xE1C3D8A5

0x51EF4E84
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0x902C2689
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0xFB80A105
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0xFB8A1E01
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0xD7621A84
to bed."
0x3B09A49D

0x51EF4E84
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x0741F49C

0x51EF4E84
"About ten."
0x657E6104

0x51EF4E84
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0xDB0D6929

0x51EF4E84
I assented.
0xB98AA100

0x51EF4E84
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0xAE9B7A61
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x8269307E
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xF44DC843
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0xDC8F6A53

0x51EF4E84
"A little."
0xFB0D6913

0x51EF4E84
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0xA6C6576A
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0xC3E0DE19
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xF5EFCB60
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x807097DA
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xB0F7CE3E

0x51EF4E84
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x78F03A5F

0x51EF4E84
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x9885D968
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0x36C60A75
not well."
0xD76F2554

0x51EF4E84
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x08859F59
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x1A550694
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0x54421E0A

0x51EF4E84
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x3D27FFA5

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x37EDFC98
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x2316E86E
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0xBF5F926F

0x51EF4E84
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0x9316A0CD

0x51EF4E84
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x9703BDB9

0x51EF4E84
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0xBA7D809F
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x73370FC5

0x51EF4E84
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0x7A952D67
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x040CC114

0x51EF4E84
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0xD8BBE14A
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0xE485B271

0x51EF4E84
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xD727346E
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0xA51E56F6
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x979E0B17
hand yours?"
0xC4764A7A

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x79652A8D
some thought."
0xA18891F5

0x51EF4E84
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0xC0E22126
other occupation."
0x3E88B9CD

0x51EF4E84
"Where did you get your copies?"
0xECB6838F

0x51EF4E84
"Out of my head."
0x5A34A59F

0x51EF4E84
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x5EC59E7D

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0xEEEA2A73

0x51EF4E84
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0xBF3D32F6

0x51EF4E84
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0xABE2AEE5

0x51EF4E84
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0x3D714CD3
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xF55C4DC5
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xA859C5CD
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0xDC1BBF2F
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x7087D5BD
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x36504314

0x51EF4E84
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x8FF571B8
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x3EEB5668
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xE120E03A
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x0CB9516C
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0xF28F344A
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0x5CC64209
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x89E9C306
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0x05B92543
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x3232E3F0
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0xDB7248F7

0x51EF4E84
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0xFD89B091
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0xED4441AB
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0xAAC3F346
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0xEA3A3EB6
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0xF3D8D9F4
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x6B84BF5F
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0xAA71F4D6
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x24248E8D
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0xB1D2A915
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0x0ED3782D

0x51EF4E84
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x8AD57AA8
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x21EA08F8
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0xE04EF18A
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xC98FE54D
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xA0F2E58D
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x5BBB542B
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x5664EEC7
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0xBE7CA5A0
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x50ABD52A
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0xB382B177
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x48EA08C0
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xEC80C2F3

0x51EF4E84
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x6A74A2E7
presently.
0xF641B8C1

0x51EF4E84
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0xF2F47725
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0xABDEE042

0x51EF4E84
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0xBE7A5D44
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0xFBD049BB
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x227326F4
each day?"
0x486E1F43

0x51EF4E84
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x2ACAE480
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x5B8E7FB9
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0xEAAFFB59

0x51EF4E84
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0x839EC641

0x51EF4E84
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x2B1A952D
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x4268C34C
powerless to realise."
0xA4E413C8

0x51EF4E84
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0xF99EB2AF
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0x2657B3F2
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x25E6AC59
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x03FC65BE
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x057DEEE4
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x92767D1D
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0x7ED4C168
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0x55929AFF
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x6E05F070

0x51EF4E84
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x96B95CE4
watch, he said abruptly--
0x20E50891

0x51EF4E84
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x2D5B0A8E
so long?  Take her to bed."
0xBBA18A8A

0x51EF4E84
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x61606618
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0xFA3E18AB
much.
0x71478DA8

0x51EF4E84
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x5F905F40
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0xB49B2C54
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0xC9358F39
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x76548EBD

0x51EF4E84
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x14B29739
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0xF8EF4F97

0x51EF4E84
"Well, is he?"
0x3F0EC54B

0x51EF4E84
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0xA08E2678

0x51EF4E84
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xC293B0FA
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xB4104731
temper, allowance should be made."
0xD5E33AC5

0x51EF4E84
"Why?"
0x66842582

0x51EF4E84
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x79C65284
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0xC926FB56
make his spirits unequal."
0x521DBBB2

0x51EF4E84
"What about?"
0x106562AA

0x51EF4E84
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xD332A78D

0x51EF4E84
"But he has no family."
0x2B14DD30

0x51EF4E84
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x64C114DD
brother a few years since."
0x701860F5

0x51EF4E84
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x271A23C4

0x51EF4E84
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x266ABC61
the property; only about nine years."
0x1EC5BC10

0x51EF4E84
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xAE62EBEA
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x9CE5AC6F

0x51EF4E84
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x4EC3C134
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x7FA043D6
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x24BF146F
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x439D004B
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x876EFBE5
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x71AEF629
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x805E0859
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x426D638F
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0x664DA45A
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0xB270D734
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0x5D760211
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x2CC63205
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x069AE81F
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0xACAC5FF8
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x3872FCED
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0xB63DB43A

0x51EF4E84
"Why should he shun it?"
0xEC85D641

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x381253D2

0x51EF4E84
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0xA567EC83
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xA4E2060D
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x6B58AC88
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0xBFAAFE65
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x76198E79
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x45B02894

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XIV
0x11AC8DC8

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0x7B9CC6A8
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0x48D497FF
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xED93F924
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0xFF942654
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x407155DD
generally did not come back till late at night.
0xD5F2F5C4

0x51EF4E84
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x834077A8
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x5DE65827
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x9CF79359
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x0FCC927C
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0xA08A7D37
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0x6AFD8A71
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x74A5D37F
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x5EBCDF97

0x51EF4E84
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x56BA52BD
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x9BBB306F
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0x4FB2F164
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x8A1A5DC0
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0x7A3F3655
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xC99DA0A3
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x88C1D802
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0x6916055A
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x1A47B3EB
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0x73754F90
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x53FC5DFB
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x9D61C339
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x8ABF6951

0x51EF4E84
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x9C39E991

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x96643B50
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0xF9A6511F
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0xD2B19BC6
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x1909C48C
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x50CA7A65
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0xB6B8E9A3
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x771E23A1

0x51EF4E84
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x4E0AA28E
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x55466380
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xD1F5B31F
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x11A61607

0x51EF4E84
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xB90424CD
contemplation.
0xA282E907

0x51EF4E84
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0x8E38CFA7
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x0EE9DAD7

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x4BBFB6C7
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0xFD0AD522
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0x295E123B
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x8EBA8FD6
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x509FB4B1
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0xC94B4383
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x9BF2E87F
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x947A136F
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x6D82DA6B
said to be thicker than water."
0xC92066F9

0x51EF4E84
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0xF7C2F611
knitting-basket in hand.
0x8C7AB9FC

0x51EF4E84
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x8565FE66
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0xD892071A
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0x807091E1
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xF0794C49
performed."
0x34A07449

0x51EF4E84
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0xCC6665AD
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x373A5969
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x3FD0D9C4
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x352B1652

0x51EF4E84
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x99148B90
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x79AB6778
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x8C93380A
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x12C24AEF
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xE5A94B2F
mind to do."
0xDC2C924F

0x51EF4E84
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x80857596
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0x6769D68D
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x80811078

0x51EF4E84
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xC77EC05A
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0xA0D65A46
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x01FF3322
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x506213FE
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x8292AE1C
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0x47B0D4FA

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x2D5D65B8
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x5B8875B5
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0xB7C78472
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x49056477
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x74EAE693
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0xAEB11F68
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xD4EAF75C
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0xD6D73673
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x924957AD
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x83122C23
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x7CEA0A5A
feeling.
0x72807FB6

0x51EF4E84
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0xAFC95500
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x4C6802F8
fastened on his physiognomy.
0x68B8E362

0x51EF4E84
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0xFA39F4A2

0x51EF4E84
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x85256C92
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x0A37C4AE
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x0CAECF7C

0x51EF4E84
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x145A4798
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x579635F2
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x7041DE00
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0xA57715BB
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x81F492E7
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x7FD4F8CF
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xBA2FDEFD

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x9533D5E5
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x8875C057
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xD2F74FD8
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xC59459C6

0x51EF4E84
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x142ECE26
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x4CC316E1
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0xDCCDD205
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x02DA2A3C
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0x30AA7CEB

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xB668F500
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0xF9EAF8E7

0x51EF4E84
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0xD53579D9
does my forehead not please you?"
0x3D46C031

0x51EF4E84
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x83F96B4A
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x5B081EA5
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0xEB234BBD

0x51EF4E84
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x630634D0

0x51EF4E84
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x81C063BF
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x9524BD48

0x51EF4E84
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x535B9A79
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0x7B4A9FD8
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x5B8952CE
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x840EB634
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0x4ACA4EC1
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x9D39E590
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0x5854F9DA
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x0DF939F5
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x7931AF44
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x05C53B8F
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x2A3A96E7
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x751662D2
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0xB92A5603
me?"
0x0F923AE0

0x51EF4E84
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x86F6C9BA

0x51EF4E84
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0xA877D933

0x51EF4E84
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0xDC14F19F
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x6ED9E427
capable of being re-transformed?
0x11807258

0x51EF4E84
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x76D021F1
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0xA3622A96
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0x0A80A001
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0x291C0074
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x4AC33B73
to-night."
0x6C8DEFDC

0x51EF4E84
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0xE3CF52C3
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x982DABB9
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x2A154587
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x6CA0B001
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x2A3C1D4D
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0xABF7DA10
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x3798EAAB
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0xEED09A86
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0xE18C6A14
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x3BC6D467
confidence.
0x028988D6

0x51EF4E84
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x17DEB480
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x81D742E9
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0x161226C2
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x5080AACD
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x9B20B8CA
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0x233CD3F9
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0xDF92721A
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x3AB365F0
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xFB2E403A
you--therefore speak."
0x0FCD64D0

0x51EF4E84
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x72BC43A7
smile either.
0xEDB83FB0

0x51EF4E84
"Speak," he urged.
0x9922B874

0x51EF4E84
"What about, sir?"
0xE3FB2696

0x51EF4E84
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0x538AFDBD
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x76B45B45

0x51EF4E84
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x10833433
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xC8927735
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0x44185D8E

0x51EF4E84
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0x8A787C40

0x51EF4E84
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xEFEDAE94
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x8758BDE5

0x51EF4E84
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xA327DB84
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x1CEAEFCF
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0xB73BEF50
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xC88F337B
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x64CF8392
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xE46B61AE
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x977A5ED2
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0x87E1A550
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x9743C6FC
rusty nail."
0x4B9EABAB

0x51EF4E84
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0xB52CE113
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0xC3682B81

0x51EF4E84
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x43715409
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x219C46A2
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x3808D653

0x51EF4E84
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x9F097E4B
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x981EA02E
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x6299D10A
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x0A7E9475
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x2165BBA5
people in one house?"
0x6CD714ED

0x51EF4E84
"Do as you please, sir."
0x38C14B88

0x51EF4E84
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x671466E2
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x126B22C4

0x51EF4E84
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0xDBA93C0E
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0xCF1094D3
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0xBABFF9B3
and experience."
0xDB7705C6

0x51EF4E84
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x77A6EDD5
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x8E7BF389
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x26245B1D
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x8B80B94E
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xFA926E24

0x51EF4E84
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xDD30DB02
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0xF0EFA827

0x51EF4E84
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0xE9303727
expression; "but speak too."
0xEED34286

0x51EF4E84
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x5D8859F6
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0x1E762399
their orders."
0x8B320F0E

0x51EF4E84
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xF8A5ABBC
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x13B8A5C8
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x9669511B

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x690E1465
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xE720DB75
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x5CD77A1D

0x51EF4E84
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0x09DB5F05
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0x76A82499

0x51EF4E84
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xF8F4F77E
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x9F3F8481
salary."
0x9C838B29

0x51EF4E84
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x1FAF7C67
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x5067872A
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x21160B20
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x345108CD
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x2834BA1E
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x378101EA
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x1FB99C9D
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xE70091C0
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x4B273328
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x0E7079BC
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x4A067F82
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x43288182
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x34D6C9FC
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0x80CEE136

0x51EF4E84
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x26FB54CB
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x61537391
as well as imagined--
0x691F264B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x08DAEB4E
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0xA1B556B3
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0xE19A6C21
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0xAC4E741D
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xBD16F8F3
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0xB7F592B1
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x2795122F
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0xB1B94F8C
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x6CEAA582
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0xE721B278
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0xB6B2C70D
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x16B25883
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0xD8D10927

0x51EF4E84
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x8FC10B9E

0x51EF4E84
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x45671EAC
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0xCAAC76D8
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x95AF075E
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x3E88F6A8
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xDE5F4D69
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0xF993D581
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x984489AD
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0xED415CAE
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x3BCC3E64
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xD80306AC
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x4F0D3BE8
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xCDFCACD4
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x71CC5BAB
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0x5AC24510
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x35689182
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x277BD216
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0x7AB008A0
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0x46C6BE72

0x51EF4E84
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0xAEF61F69

0x51EF4E84
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0x642D2AD8
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x1C9ED6DA
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x16222CDD
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x7EE471E0
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0x203ABC69
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x6C4AC199
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0x079A7DD8
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0x62C060FD
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0xA8851DD8

0x51EF4E84
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x5154D0E9

0x51EF4E84
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0x574E18AA
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0x235148FE
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0x03C578AB
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0x43AC31F7
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0xC80E6297

0x51EF4E84
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0x650749A6

0x51EF4E84
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0xD57470CD
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0x0F8CE82D
moor."
0xA49B52AB

0x51EF4E84
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0x68FDA77C

0x51EF4E84
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0x545E4137
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0x9C0B1237
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x025C6D5A
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0x2036E079
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0x61C1F3B2

0x51EF4E84
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x3E83CCFC
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0x7239402F

0x51EF4E84
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x710F010F
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0xD4F7775A
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x58C563FD
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0xA205B2A8
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0x999495D1
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0x12CD0B9F

0x51EF4E84
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0xCE5247D0

0x51EF4E84
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0xEF5574E8
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0xE4E58FE9
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0xA178D305

0x51EF4E84
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0x8FEC7870
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0x28C26815
misery if you listen to it."
0x91715447

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0x56C03E0D
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0xEC213426
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0xA8252D43

0x51EF4E84
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x6F5957F6
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0xB7B51510
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0x6392808A

0x51EF4E84
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0x8025A4C3
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0x7F06165C
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x57316E66

0x51EF4E84
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0x77C6116D
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x5277BB50
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0x2096AC36
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0x6FD83806
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0xF36D6E64
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0x1E96F519
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0x88BC2368
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0xC6C719B8
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0xCDF3EB0D
which you might revert with pleasure."
0x55B192C6

0x51EF4E84
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0xF07E77E9
paving hell with energy."
0x60052D5C

0x51EF4E84
"Sir?"
0x2E978866

0x51EF4E84
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0x93769E40
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0xAB9F6270
been."
0x463034CF

0x51EF4E84
"And better?"
0xF8143C1F

0x51EF4E84
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0x3137A526
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0xB22CA11C
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0x47C329FD
and Persians, that both are right."
0x9A72A835

0x51EF4E84
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0x11BF55CE

0x51EF4E84
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0xD22F0A7D
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0xFD1E1B05

0x51EF4E84
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0x4B8ABC86
is liable to abuse."
0x59D479ED

0x51EF4E84
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0x8A347A6C
abuse it."
0x019DB597

0x51EF4E84
"You are human and fallible."
0x6D092722

0x51EF4E84
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0x8B476709

0x51EF4E84
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0x9B65F4C0
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xBEDF6085

0x51EF4E84
"What power?"
0x2B5036A9

0x51EF4E84
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x573B3235
right.'"
0x78A175A7

0x51EF4E84
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0x2D3958BD

0x51EF4E84
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0xF0BCDAE8
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0x65933218
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0x7E3DE6B6
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0xF1476E6B
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0x707183BB

0x51EF4E84
"Where are you going?"
0xAAF6DC89

0x51EF4E84
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xCBEFD355

0x51EF4E84
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0x12F5DACC

0x51EF4E84
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0x9DA43F15
certainly not afraid."
0x2A721122

0x51EF4E84
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0x510F1DC0

0x51EF4E84
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0xADEF484D

0x51EF4E84
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0x981C6A7F
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0x51653177
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x628C683F
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0x0C88592A
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0x4A5A70B5
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0xA5D47BAE
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0x770439D3
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x9ADC729D
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0xF2A51E9C
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0xBF9B5BE2
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0x65D06A60
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x2949C61C
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0xDB884CF2
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0x72C09FFA

0x51EF4E84
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x1396F845

0x51EF4E84
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0x41B385A2
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0x8346F088
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0x9F197BAD
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0x22A85CEC
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0xC6B13AE1
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0x8888C19F
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0xA2D0B38B
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0x19058D9E
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x71CB4661
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x05573E6B
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0x6D4D9580
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0x7CC35A1B
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0x7C78CE09
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x0C065BB5
will be realised."
0x22AE425B

0x51EF4E84
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0x188A2F33
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x423B1167
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0x1C17F161
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0xAF1E4BB2
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0xDFD1C44B
and small white satin sandals.
0x0A67CA17

0x51EF4E84
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0xC390AD2C
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0x2704C743

0x51EF4E84
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0x5A94DD5C
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0xFFED203A
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0x102B865A

0x51EF4E84
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0xC0F4C17B
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0x594F0518

0x51EF4E84
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x281C7460
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0xD5CF1DD5
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x6F226B2F
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x5DB9F8CA
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0x1D9B37EC
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0xC0D4E637
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x1316D8C2
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xD1BFFC6D
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0xD5D499D2
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x58CC599A
Good-night."
0xE97209D5

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XV
0xE6A26BDA

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x8E68CB5A
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0xE817E124
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0xD851C738
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0x8BF8484C

0x51EF4E84
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0x0979C532
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x95687CF7
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x1A1BC9E0
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x701FEB16
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x807DC5BC
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0xBE464F06

0x51EF4E84
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x59FBE8F6
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x467B80B9
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xC84FC9EF
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0xB6CB6D8E
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0x632F29C4
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x782FFE52
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0xA51BEEE1
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xDE2DDFE1
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0xF6E1BA4F
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0xD098A810
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0xBAEC1F55
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x2F75F654
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0xCB8CCA63
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0x98646A1F
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x3B2AD6BE
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0xDF3E4C21
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0xF26748DE
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xB864702A
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x4466BE83
now, if you will excuse me."
0xEB641BBA

0x51EF4E84
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x4F22F343
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x3B1A6C2F
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x9E8B3DD6

0x51EF4E84
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x726F8BF6
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0xDEC94851
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0xBA37E5B4
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0xA9B06603
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xE02C8A05
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0xC9B6DFD3
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x23E478E1
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0x6EE30196
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0xEE91E055
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0x01F5850F
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0xAF6EE38B
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0xF32B9DCA
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0xB8B6D109
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0xAF1549F1
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x53F85BCF
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0x549839F6
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0xF8DF2E60
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x949452C0

0x51EF4E84
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x09CC2C6F
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x5BA524FF
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0x5CCD493A
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x0828C279
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0x76D8E1BE
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x83C9FFF4
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x82A77E08
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0xCB158C63
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x19556B96
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0xBD94F3C2
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x0349404F
current--as I am now.
0x172DCB2B

0x51EF4E84
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0xA78694E3
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xF873E8FB
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0xCFC48B18
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x603D907B
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x60683D0F
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xC781966E

0x51EF4E84
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x59A4BD73
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x8BC9996A
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0x9EF43A13

0x51EF4E84
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0xC92CF27E
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x14564193
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x7C26DC60
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x6ADCA324
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0xDB300914
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x46948F2C
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xF7DD92C0
his countenance: he went on--
0x9DC8A251

0x51EF4E84
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x84A09D50
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x510A7E91
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x5C7F24F4
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x211C8EF6
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x8B689E8B
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x28AB70BE
if you dare!'
0x885B73D5

0x51EF4E84
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x5F896035
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x5C567CFC
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x4CAD845E
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0xF4680F24
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xA56FFC5C
but straw and rotten wood."
0x20C37719

0x51EF4E84
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x3D21D5AC
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x30B41BCC
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x81E0C08C
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0x70603A5E

0x51EF4E84
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0xCC88AA8C

0x51EF4E84
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0xD146861B
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0xCB192165
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xEDC58CDD
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xC508761F
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0xF3215C6D
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0xDB907569
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x296CDA92
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x81482E49
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0xF02F46BF
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xBE8F4975
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x105B9184
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0xB2BEB072
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x9EDC8B1F
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0x0A0AFD31
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x97A43B0E
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0xC40DD489
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0xD28DDF19
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x690E2282
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x1DA3C37E
After this digression he proceeded--
0x111F4249

0x51EF4E84
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x603C946B
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0xD1537E4E
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0x939B500C
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0xB822F6B1
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0x56C61050
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x0F6D100C
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0xA737EA83
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0xD746FA1F
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0xB5C23EBA
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0xAB510667
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x574E5ACB
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xEBA73A1F
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0xC0994F2E
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xD8A633CB
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x51FA5B94
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x4CF7A540
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0x8717028A
who had been her dupe.
0x63B1C598

0x51EF4E84
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xC9F4C97F
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x0D4E976C
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0xF1053E06
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0xB605F7A4
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0x51A82F2A
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xA7A6D597
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0xD55D683D
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0x1DDAD907
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0xD4C7E8EA
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0xD75E161E
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0x4F6B819F

0x51EF4E84
Adele here came running up again.
0xD864FDCB

0x51EF4E84
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0x8A8AB01F
wishes to see you."
0xC4DA23C6

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x718733E4
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x5D05B2A6
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x5B6F9F12
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xF7E3A476
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0x92E03CB4
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x3427ED8B
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x345CEA88
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0x79D77DAC
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x93E16802
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xD11567E1
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0x6E1F5F44
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x2DE14D0D
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0x61967AE2
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x58FB294D
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0xCDAE1B46
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x21658F9E
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x56F86470
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0xBA55BC10
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xB75BFB1D
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x61EF3854
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0xA6FDF95D
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x9321DEE8

0x51EF4E84
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0xAC0CAFEE
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xE05203F0
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x1BA9BBFA
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0x2C0F408D
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0xF8290950
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x582580F9

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x7C5FEF10
you too: it darkens."
0x972524FD

0x51EF4E84
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0x2C1BCAEE
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x3ECB64E4
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0xFD404E17
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0xF6815E61
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0xBB6B5E48
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x34A78AE6
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0xDA5CB3C0
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x30A3F49D
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0x868A9493
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0xFFBFB2A7
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x588240B3
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0x48AF9522

0x51EF4E84
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0xB3AC37D9
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x77D4CBC4
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0xA6A17C92
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0xEE9AE67A
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x5EE227B4
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0xE7CBCE6D
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x2F1D96AE
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0xA81028A3
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x3399694C
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x44018704
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x4C169D67
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x95E944C9
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0x49CB5B96
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x85697DBD
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0xFCEA7A00
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x1BE8EDF7
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0xCEC22E19
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0xB93AAEA6
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x04643C3B
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0xBC7FC78A
benefit.
0xB1181DBB

0x51EF4E84
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x7520B506
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0x3B6832C2
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0xDAE78E85
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0x523E51F7
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x8440FF4A
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0x10355535
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x72622DA6
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x57517142
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0xBADC0441

0x51EF4E84
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0xC2F4ED3C
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x72574656
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x5B001764
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xC94C84A8
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0xA9015DF6
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x937D7C61
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xE40859C3
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x84848D92

0x51EF4E84
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x8D5EA058
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0xEE4D33A3
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0x1EA0805E
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x51FF878F
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0x147BB5EE
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0xA936AAD1
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xBB5561AB
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0x34ADA54E
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0xE505F557
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x39DB7C48
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x0979FE08
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0xD3D7F998
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0x0DD89E47
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0xAB4E9418
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x34B467C0
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xD87D1B19
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x2544DE07
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x21E9A9E3
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0xF9824D0F

0x51EF4E84
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0xAED47E78
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0x7F26A6E2
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0xBB60D3B3
Thornfield.
0x4B2DFA1D

0x51EF4E84
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x4669F770
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0xB91DF88A
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0xBD9C6A0D
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x52A7DE8A
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0x3A855098

0x51EF4E84
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x224F5DF3
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x94D3373A
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0x2FE7F467
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x560D26EA
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x1F40C5D5

0x51EF4E84
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x4893C1C0
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x606420E0
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0xAB1D6367
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x49BB7E12
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x75ECB767

0x51EF4E84
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xFB1D236C
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0xDAF06FE8
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x5D5A9986
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x68C1D773
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0x9AF5F3F2
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x59D29467
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xABC46FF6
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x31A75457
enough.
0x9E1B2D77

0x51EF4E84
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x165BF2E2
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0xA20F6587
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x9D02DF6F
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x9514924D
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x269F1B8A
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xE0207236
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0x830BCC83
there?"
0x96C1A014

0x51EF4E84
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x146A68CF
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0xE3B0D195
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x1AE55051

0x51EF4E84
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0xEAF6B0F3
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0xA2C56642
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0x0A296107
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x0EB567C5
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x8543D68B
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0xCC80638B
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xE78F1ED2
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0xFFE4FA68
burning.
0xE2AE3798

0x51EF4E84
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x56BF006C
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x34C4B5F1
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x2EA27FDD
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x38A8A570
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x6C301E1B
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0xD47812AF

0x51EF4E84
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x1F67EE63
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x1499C857
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xD6DEC5C2
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0xFCDC75A3
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0xAEB7A3FC
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0xF9DA468D
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x305E4D2C

0x51EF4E84
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x9C2EC400
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xB5429553
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0x323F27CC
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0x824672BA
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xA89DCB7E
water.
0x28DA81AD

0x51EF4E84
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x3E6BA411

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x8CD68C96
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x2F1A6F49

0x51EF4E84
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x907925AB
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x3F873556
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x08BA1FA5

0x51EF4E84
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0xCD90EE1B
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x35ECD339

0x51EF4E84
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0xE1CE75B0
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x9E9DDE01
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x97EA5D1D

0x51EF4E84
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0xACF038DA
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0xC6F1D981
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0x049D69BC

0x51EF4E84
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0xD63D2DAA
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0xB2927D90
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0xC9DF3F06
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x13C4B8D9
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xA7A33A3F

0x51EF4E84
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0x1C90AD4D

0x51EF4E84
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x0DA3042A
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0x554ECAA7

0x51EF4E84
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0xA8720E89

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0xD4AB4FEE
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x58AD486F

0x51EF4E84
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0x3AB57F7E

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xCE27486D
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x104853D3
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x6D7857F0
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0xB8F8C67C
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x55806389
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x09256021
move, remember, or call any one."
0xF02A142F

0x51EF4E84
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xF2EF8AAE
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0xB9AAD3D6
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xF71E75D8
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0x3BD90DAD
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x5B71A426
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0x1BA385BD
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0x08F234BC
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0xC3982622
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0xD001ACCB
"and not something worse."
0x98FB405B

0x51EF4E84
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x59CBE1DC
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x4A07BE90

0x51EF4E84
"How, sir?"
0x7D176CC4

0x51EF4E84
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x18373F42
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0x261C8D31

0x51EF4E84
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0x73BA1B37
door."
0xD2C08B78

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0xB6F58A9A

0x51EF4E84
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0x54970021
think, or something like it?"
0x1585D348

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x8AAEB672
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x49DCCBFE

0x51EF4E84
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0xDDB35226
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0xD88D4AAF
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x05DFE75B
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x73C3F154
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x7D48BE24
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x8E951A43
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0xACA4C72C
hours the servants will be up."
0x3AC28774

0x51EF4E84
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x5D18CD40

0x51EF4E84
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xABA53B5D
go.
0xEF751A70

0x51EF4E84
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0x0805FD07

0x51EF4E84
"You said I might go, sir."
0xD4A49EB6

0x51EF4E84
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0xF4EB2B74
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x67CA8BAE
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xBD434255
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0x52441B02
At least shake hands."
0x41704B3C

0x51EF4E84
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0x85803385
both his own.
0xC04B1FCA

0x51EF4E84
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x6051907D
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x7C873594
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x15D5902E
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0xC977E41D

0x51EF4E84
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x90BA616A
his voice was checked.
0xD14E201C

0x51EF4E84
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0x44A46F65
in the case."
0xE6675490

0x51EF4E84
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0x6C18B90E
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0x99996EA1
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xD68E6F3B
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xC45F7728
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x5BD71E5D
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0xBA98C771

0x51EF4E84
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x732A9F5A

0x51EF4E84
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x76464150

0x51EF4E84
"What! you _will_ go?"
0xF4A72D65

0x51EF4E84
"I am cold, sir."
0x5A8A0E32

0x51EF4E84
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0xB8760D7B
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0xC73FD5EC
expedient.
0x9BB1A08D

0x51EF4E84
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0xBFD4FC85

0x51EF4E84
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x7A4B04CD

0x51EF4E84
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x1D3AFC6D
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x3DA903F0
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0x50E492DA
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0xD42B51C8
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xC5C9C173
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x13CFC32D
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x6F7730FF
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0xF3A4BD03

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XVI
0x4B161E5C

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x0838EB03
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0x914CEC2C
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x1C864BAB
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0xD7FAF10C
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0x31ACED47
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x07B0C5E0

0x51EF4E84
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x6AE610A3
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xDF3BD232
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0xAA1F3899
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0xF4D4A6EB
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xD1AA20A3
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0xDCE7637B
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0x8C77F654
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0x7D6690A2
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x9E916E40

0x51EF4E84
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0xDBE96685
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0x32EF1FF0
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0xDDED78D2
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0xC3E90435
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x038E24DE
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0x940D1E67
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0xF0399EF7
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0xB5E70A3C
no other than Grace Poole.
0xFF9E49AD

0x51EF4E84
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x1171F7EA
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0xC2F8C290
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0x60B6AF2F
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0x38DA412D
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x0FD3961B
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x84D15DA2
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0x257E12DA
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x9FA527F7
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x8CBAEAD8
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0xCFB5539E
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x639D2260
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0x05DDE220
went on with her sewing.
0x40579B6B

0x51EF4E84
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0xA8F25D67
is past comprehension."
0xB7F6AEFD

0x51EF4E84
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x752F856E
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0xD89BE9BD

0x51EF4E84
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0xC2600CEC
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0x80657A9D
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xF93E9A3C
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x029D8F09

0x51EF4E84
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x3D42110C
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x302F789F

0x51EF4E84
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x266E8579
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x8B6BC92B
she answered--
0x1830D634

0x51EF4E84
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0xDC48C0AD
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0x537B6232
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x1BAD3CD4
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0x0D7CCAFE
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x783FBCCD
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x7326E43A
a noise?"
0x090EFFE6

0x51EF4E84
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x7D0DD119
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0xC0D28753
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0x01E48F25

0x51EF4E84
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x6BF64F0E
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x46DA3054

0x51EF4E84
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x44EEDC81
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0xFACCBD9E

0x51EF4E84
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x4094C00E
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x069108A4
conscious eye.
0x8BADE7B4

0x51EF4E84
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xA989CDB3

0x51EF4E84
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xAB98D1F5

0x51EF4E84
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x1F0F6DA3
gallery?" she further asked.
0xA7829677

0x51EF4E84
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0xDE3A7B85
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x83954D28
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x491DDD26
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0xC9EDF6E5

0x51EF4E84
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0xFAEF12E7

0x51EF4E84
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x0392BFFF
you get into bed?"
0x49DEB6D0

0x51EF4E84
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x3941C1C9
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0xD8B0819D
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0x032BB8AD
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x1574A205
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x86954A91
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x4B72B70B
lie down."
0x65145F0E

0x51EF4E84
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x75896314
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xE373D9C2
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0xD4AF9D7A
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0x78AA18ED
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0xAFDFA633
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x3268A969
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x6E1D05B1
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0xC5B21CA0
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x901F9B85
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xBD773547
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x4E1531B7
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x697BE109
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x51C9929D

0x51EF4E84
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x4C75413C
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x0C367826
entered.
0x6F1F776B

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x9BB18D30
be ready: will you come down?"
0x0A05EA7C

0x51EF4E84
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x4877F9E1
carry it upstairs."
0xD17E225D

0x51EF4E84
"You'll have some meat?"
0x0398AE06

0x51EF4E84
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0xE04B1B84

0x51EF4E84
"And the sago?"
0xC404D303

0x51EF4E84
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0x4F5CAD45
make it myself."
0x3AFB5CA7

0x51EF4E84
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x886CF11B
so I departed.
0xBA18F24F

0x51EF4E84
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x50C95907
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0xBDFC6AED
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x8677D6C1
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x3C7A5EAB
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x8B2B0DBF
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xFA78ACAC
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x0487096C
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0xE248C9CE
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x058A6A85
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xEEF08861
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0xF19ABE9D
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0xB787BD5B

0x51EF4E84
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x1D3D41E6
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x377EA5FE
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0x5B1A71D4
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x10A0389D
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0xEC8EA98C
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0xAFA58BA9
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x9D80CC40
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0x892D55A8
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x536395D8
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x7D8E289D
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0x953DF29A
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0x8DF3AEE7
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0xE9F46ABD
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0x54097A4F
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x552AADF1
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x019B79C0
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x9482D879
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x9BFF3D9A
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x302CE417
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xCBC9BA04

0x51EF4E84
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0xC7441E5B
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x3E2DAD26
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0xABF85B11

0x51EF4E84
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x8846CF87
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xA4DC5B6E

0x51EF4E84
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0x699916D6
thinking.
0xBCFB2345

0x51EF4E84
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x88EC0AF4
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0x5B47E19A
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0xF5866A92
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0x1B6A127B
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x2BBEF03C
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0x06B380C7

0x51EF4E84
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0x571B38FD
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x0FFF1470
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0x69B943CC
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x5C4BA86D
impatient."
0xFC32AB83

0x51EF4E84
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0xD75813A6
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x5CFF750A
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0xE2EF3116
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x9DDC1A92
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x4D5F8156
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0xAA0FCF62
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0xC6A7EDC4
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x91882491
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x464079B2
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x7622F3EA
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x64C7B7EE
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x21E0036B
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x5E7AEB7B
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x3ED6C21B
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0x1F57F713
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0x785C2279
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0xF1949013
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x14485912
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x47763182

0x51EF4E84
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0xB0DC5D6D
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0xBA692B93
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x668EBC07
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x874B1BEC

0x51EF4E84
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x0EE36A1A
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xFD26251E
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0xD093FFFC

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x05B375D1

0x51EF4E84
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0xAF272044
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0xF1FA9E37
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0xD72CC56B
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x3227AEA2
deepening into total obscurity.
0x7E03C8CC

0x51EF4E84
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0x9ABEDF9A
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x90E79FA3
his journey."
0x1F453AC0

0x51EF4E84
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x47217ED1

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0xB6BCB808
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0xCA4FE424
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0xE4379001
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x0A030731

0x51EF4E84
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x98106A40

0x51EF4E84
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xE20C8925
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0x46A9A95D
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x37E60F35
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0xCC3C4E3D
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0x436101C8
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xDC40E8BE
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0xD7788C9B
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0xE6D57770
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xB3154764
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x3DBB7AB0

0x51EF4E84
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0xE12DC646

0x51EF4E84
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x0197BC84
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x7594F6A5
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0xE2CD14FC
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0xF627B4EE
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x5699B440
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0x75C73207
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0xE663B836
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0x5F68A26E
the evening."
0xFAD7F326

0x51EF4E84
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x6C24FF6B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x3AF5DB77
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0x46D91D43
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xA0CD929D
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0xA89F3004
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0xAF6BAD88
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0xD08FD5FE
was certainly the queen."
0x12BB19E4

0x51EF4E84
"And what was she like?"
0xFA16521D

0x51EF4E84
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xE771614A
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0xFE9D8C6B
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xE41CA6A5
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x4D76DD9F
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0xAED65CC6
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0x942C7DA6
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x3FF01780
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x522CEC4C
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x6767851E
jetty mass of her curls."
0xD97D7D07

0x51EF4E84
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x45D6B2D3

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0xB97A858E
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0xBECB0968
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x5AC5A476

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0xB98BB4D1

0x51EF4E84
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0x049A2E97

0x51EF4E84
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0x85E2D6CD

0x51EF4E84
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0xF8DCB440
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x914233F5
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x659ED976

0x51EF4E84
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0xC74F0412

0x51EF4E84
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0xC14FF5C4
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0x61421532
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0x011E5B9D

0x51EF4E84
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x50149C73
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x76CE1C45

0x51EF4E84
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0xC26891DA
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0x5221705C

0x51EF4E84
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0xF39DD1FA

0x51EF4E84
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0xFCB22585
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0x67F48C13
began tea."
0x20D972E2

0x51EF4E84
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0x3E784FB6

0x51EF4E84
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x4EEF5E97
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x61AFAFFE
conversation was turned into another channel.
0x74E1ADEF

0x51EF4E84
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0xE405D9F6
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0xB41316F6
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x3E8E5052
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0xAD801721

0x51EF4E84
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x2864F544
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x3E8DC4E1
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x8D9C21AF
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0xA9F2B515
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0xA000F3DE
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x1CF3E7C9

0x51EF4E84
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x6AA9ECCC
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x8829867A
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0xF1BB80F9

0x51EF4E84
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0x7D4FED75
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0x23629649
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x01A44AC6
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0xC79DFCED
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x5C05BAAF
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x7CA5C50A
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xB6107400
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0x37D76514
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0x7D2452E8
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xE7B83537
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x5E941AEA
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0xD69FA774
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x1ACBBBA9
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0xBC20CAC8
is no extrication.
0xFC5E500B

0x51EF4E84
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x92131D10
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0x1D7CDCDD
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x299B82D7
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0xF6F2E654
poor, and plain.'
0xF08FD71A

0x51EF4E84
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0x71AF6898
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xD86B6A61
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x7A424413
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0x50A5D8A3
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x9AF01843
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x692DD1C1
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x710A5E7E
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0xB45FEDA2
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0xA1947782
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x0570FE8F
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0xA5B90C01
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0x3834BC47
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xC098BDD2

0x51EF4E84
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0x4559ED01
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x15D6A3D2
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x24EB68FA
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0xBFF83FEA
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x4963DB92

0x51EF4E84
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x4029763D
calm, and fell asleep.
0x00CB1E69

0x51EF4E84
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0xB1F10DDF
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x367911F4
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x23DB5D42
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x96BCA83C
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x8AB5285E
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x175BDF26
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x6B9EF79A

0x51EF4E84
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0xA4D6F38D
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x4F209A18
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0xF69EA61D
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x2272FEA9
maintain, even externally.
0x08CFD161

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XVII
0x506E26AF

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0x527B94D8
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0xC1854F06
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0x744BEBE0
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xF3B7E7A2
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xA89D7811
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0xEB0D33B9
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0x656D1192
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x9F6D0CE1
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xCA6EC009
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0xD211562A
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x4B69DDC2
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xE4EE35B8
on the contrary, I just said--
0xBA7D8DC2

0x51EF4E84
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0xC7E4BE31
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x23715229
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xB0FDC2BD
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x7A830F65
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x23BF5539
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xC0B2C34A
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x09847829
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0xEE4CCBBE
wanted and would be despised."
0x22960ECB

0x51EF4E84
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0xD086EFA0
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0xBB18D472
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x321847D5
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x3871BFBE
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0xE6EEFBA5

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0xF90739B6
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0xDFF78688

0x51EF4E84
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x24CD5BB8
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x461A497E

0x51EF4E84
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x38CDAA87
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x8E299C5A
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x8A7E0719
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0xAFCBA379
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0x57B65DAE

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0xCF5CAC63
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x9A2608AC
holding the note before her spectacles.
0xF8475E79

0x51EF4E84
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x90C2ED51
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0xAB24A9CC
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0xB6144BAA

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x1846C34D

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0xF1F33E4B
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x71281381
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0xD2837B19
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0xFCB05145
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x5ACCBCB7
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x298099F5
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x3F302F5E
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x412D3445

0x51EF4E84
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x7BC47354
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x2752B88E
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x93FCD199
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0xF482A2D6
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0xD3608163
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xC90DA2A0
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x90328886
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0x65769E48
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0xA81D2A51
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x52C96BB4
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x1C4A9743
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x884A9C52
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x3D68B837
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x5E2C68FB
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x6DD47C00
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0xAABD00A8
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0xE33E9221
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x0040647A

0x51EF4E84
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0xE49B4A55
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x6E360C08
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x95B5037E
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x95772CE7
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x42E4305A
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0xB7877DEA
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x0EC72077
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x5B270A82
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0xA7707CA9
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x56757B92
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x8D96DF16
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x373B3766
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x32E54524
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0xF02D0317
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0xD3A15098
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0xE0D6785E
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x94FF6A32
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x41FED765
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x65315BF4
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x493C5145

0x51EF4E84
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x01969731
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0x61150D20
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x14162AFB
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0xFCE19008
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x7492DE3E
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x86E944A1

0x51EF4E84
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x2A606C62

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0x104AB387
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0xFEB8872E
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0x61563E1B
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0xEC14A777
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0xCDCC5174
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xDCF3A1F1
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x83E88CF1

0x51EF4E84
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x7E176E60

0x51EF4E84
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0xFE945426
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0xEF012DE4
the money she gets."
0xABE09023

0x51EF4E84
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0xFF07C595

0x51EF4E84
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x35117A5A
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0xCC20AC48

0x51EF4E84
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x5FA5EE6F

0x51EF4E84
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x684FD09C
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0xDB84A071
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x9DA5FAD7
excluded.
0x020EF23B

0x51EF4E84
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xC5DBF656
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0xC08886D4
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0x9BFFEFAF
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x88A93F4F
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0xF2EC3987
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x83A4A094
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x89FDEB2B
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0x2AD6BD93
sides.
0x946AAC18

0x51EF4E84
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x416D454A
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0x02A48458
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x99073872
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0x771C1944
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0xDE6E1091
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x28733090
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x1F80C346
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x689E0AD8
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0xCC1666E6

0x51EF4E84
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0xEE260CA2
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0xA5E7EF84
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0xBD947093
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0x06CC08DF

0x51EF4E84
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0xB9D8CA19
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x8DC97148
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xE80F3C7E
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x971E85FF
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x5AC0E037
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x28AF3311

0x51EF4E84
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x17DB55B5
minutes."
0xAF26B1EF

0x51EF4E84
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x9A7C2735
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0xB58BE5FF

0x51EF4E84
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0xE4255059
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0xF3556277
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x3D2E9048
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0x9D3BD738
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x9E24ECEB
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xB745C00C
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0xFCEE60A0
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x575F7371
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0xD3F515DC

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xFB575E0D
below.
0xD606BBED

0x51EF4E84
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0x19FC1A85
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x2DE3FBE7
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x96373ADB
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0x6392711F
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x9F743C24
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x5A05D810
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0xC522F43A

0x51EF4E84
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x1F09CE55
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0xD33651EC
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0xCA4BBF49
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0xFF526215
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0xD1FAB33C
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x4457F7BC
and, for a time, a hush.
0x359A0F66

0x51EF4E84
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x51C02D33
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0xA887AD03

0x51EF4E84
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xF95C6FE8
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x6CD9E607
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0x158F3826
on apprend."
0xFF28590E

0x51EF4E84
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0x443C412B

0x51EF4E84
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xC466F0C7
mange."
0x6C570167

0x51EF4E84
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xCC8499A2
get you something to eat."
0x1560D871

0x51EF4E84
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x9ECEB3B8
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xF2B42502
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0xE791B6BD
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0x9B01D719
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x4FF13812
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x903C7EDA
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0xF383C7C7
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0xBB2366F8
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x42F2AE3D
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0xB6EEDDEE
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x35CFBFC7
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x1A7DEA26
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0x07B9243A
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0xC69DBD41
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0xD04DA077
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x2DE27E02
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x91F5D231

0x51EF4E84
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0xC3BA73EB
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x7E855394
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x327D9B39
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0xDE5AC79C
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x218CF4BF
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0xFE8269A3
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x9FB13BCC

0x51EF4E84
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x64866936
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x3424E885
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x0B4C1F87
dinner?"
0x9DEC1366

0x51EF4E84
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0x454CB48F
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0xC9A8AD76
is your dinner."
0x3FA6CE4C

0x51EF4E84
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x828CC5D8
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0xA068567B
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0xCC2C9A89
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0xB972EE2D
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x31DBB7CC
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0xDD4B4D0C
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x0F0F827D
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x32201C7A
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xBD4A6003
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0x51435E81
quel dommage!"
0x12D985A3

0x51EF4E84
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x1A83E17C
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x04D77D00
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x1A049F6D
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xF275333F
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0xFBCF4D2B
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0xDB5B2514
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x03F8B8B8
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0xCEA8184D
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x290EC1E1
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x8B46B7DF
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x136C572A
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0xF1F104BD
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0xEDC2D216
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0x0834EECD

0x51EF4E84
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0xD92E146D
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x9EF987CD
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x854EAEF5
sought their chambers.
0x1454D6EC

0x51EF4E84
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0xEF764AF7
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0x93DFD402
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0xB67CD67B
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0xFFFCBA7D
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x9DBC6F88
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x2DA4717B
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0xB7791949

0x51EF4E84
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x01AD8EE4
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x2487EAB3
ladies."
0x1827A325

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x79728C26

0x51EF4E84
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0xA0362298
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xF024FB54
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x77628DEC

0x51EF4E84
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x7546EA16
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0x639CB967
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x80CB0A34
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xB484E813

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0x39374313
answered.
0x32FF82F9

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x7988D63D
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0xCB4A47F4
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0xC7D459B0
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0x2F8409C8
case of contumacy.'"
0x77087B3F

0x51EF4E84
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x17EB17EE
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x072DE804

0x51EF4E84
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x6A14CD2E
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0x781B00B0
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xBA7C0718
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0x7030E02D
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0x5C91739D
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x2B40DAE1
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x5D117683

0x51EF4E84
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x04E3FAD1

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0x5B4E7E8D
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0xCB54B6AA
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x6543D265
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x59E5987E
stay at Thornfield."
0x3726D6CF

0x51EF4E84
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0xBE04D91A
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x3CF81F98
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0x2743D8C3
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x53341CD5
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0xDE0DDD11
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x998A9AE2
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0x20B6F5B4
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0xDFEB03F1
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0x55C6E810
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xFE81652E
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x76C97032
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xE7A744AC
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0xA62EA91D
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0x59642356
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x4A58CFBB
descended.
0xD91F9F7F

0x51EF4E84
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x0C364830
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0xC2D4C2A4
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0x77D2EEC4
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0xFF1ABDB2
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0x28155B17
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x6082A8B5
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x6F161029
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x2D78D860

0x51EF4E84
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0x8545848C
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xD8925DAF
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x77491362
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0x2A8CEF84
touched my knee.
0xF9D87E43

0x51EF4E84
"What is it, Adele?"
0x7343CEC2

0x51EF4E84
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0xFE989D36
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x0435D69F

0x51EF4E84
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0xFF4540C2
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x88D28484
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x41A8A6A6
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x021CA4EC
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x3951ABA0
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x73A50AD2

0x51EF4E84
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0x7939AE8A
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x94268B17
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x5C5BA712
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x99D66DD8
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x1B951460

0x51EF4E84
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x22797D68
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xC9C44E07
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x5C2CBCBB
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0xFB5B46FD
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0xD70BF0A8
stared at me.
0xDC2E6CB8

0x51EF4E84
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0xA6D5E4B5
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xFCF0C430
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x66F7F7F8
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x14B36EF2
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x4A02C706
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x641DFF29
and may as well mention them now.
0x103447B9

0x51EF4E84
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xEF6C12C0
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x1CCDE2B3
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0x18A40130
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x3AA566E0
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x8E80B660
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x7260B977
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x31FC7A4C

0x51EF4E84
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x923CC8A0
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x5D99023C
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x0269C614
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0xC0F59753

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xCC80EAA9
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0xF98B871F
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x24C8C506
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xD97108EE

0x51EF4E84
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x26578E2A
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0xC30DFCD8
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x9358E74A
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x31BD4206
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x082AF6F0
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x1578E584
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0xFEE98858
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0xB447892E
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0xCA3BE410
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x7588C9FA
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0x1A0E5E20
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0x67BAD6C1
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x18ACA3F5
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x79322B00
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xB1E1B812
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x590775CB
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xA5CC3B9F
truly imperial dignity.
0x0C4E8626

0x51EF4E84
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0xD74C144A
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x5DD8CB7C
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x07CEEC22
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0xBF139A3C
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0x6BDE41AA
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x5A2F79F8
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x647AA4ED

0x51EF4E84
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x0080F950
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x1176AB93
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x31253894
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0x9B32E58B
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x3E0EEFAB
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0xEB8DBF4C
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0xB20FC768
haughty lip.
0xC8169E69

0x51EF4E84
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0xC667DC9D
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x814433FE
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0xFB11ECFC
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x10931AF8
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x0B8CBA0F
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xA7379E57
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x9733E34B
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0xB4419904
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x9A9FAE06
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xF7071720
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x2DCAFB6A

0x51EF4E84
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x0F60476A
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0xB5423929
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x63EBC418
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0xCDD48EA2
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0xDAEDED24
in spotless white.
0x503C6863

0x51EF4E84
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0xE78C4350
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x1F99AB68
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0xF2F07AC9
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0xE9B5015C
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x01CA7ABE
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x763DBD2B
together.
0x2DB8EE61

0x51EF4E84
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0xB0E34A73
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0xA3228235
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x6EF7FCB5
gravity--
0xC0C3401D

0x51EF4E84
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0x034CD12C

0x51EF4E84
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x32B6624A
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0xA8B87703

0x51EF4E84
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0xB97ED5BF
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x3B58603F

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x02D7042C

0x51EF4E84
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x3FFAD601
child!"
0x1B30B9D0

0x51EF4E84
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xF99F3BB7
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0xD6A244B5
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0xC0EBF3B9
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0xB46E4E7F

0x51EF4E84
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xBA2AAAFB
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x85E202B0
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x663182E3
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0x6842A59A
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0xD09305C3
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x25B726A2
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0xB699C36F
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x1CA1CE56
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0xE0228432
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x3402BEA4
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0xC8AB58D4
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0xB2615619
blood or vigour of brain.
0x284A10AD

0x51EF4E84
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x69A54A36

0x51EF4E84
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x47B32210
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0xB756B402
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x04345244
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x694A987D
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0xC242C437
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0xD45E34CA
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x7A87F9EE
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xD35FFF72
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0xBFF11C0F
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0x27C9C084
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0xBF52DC8D
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0x28253D9D
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x3657245F
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0xCB57C005

0x51EF4E84
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x8D1F2A18
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0xD219C14A
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x4B1D96BB
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0xBAAF809E
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0x9C9FAEFE
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x5D9C1391
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0x4FF534A3
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0xF25DD68D

0x51EF4E84
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x0108A802
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x89E5195E
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x2622CBC1
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0xAF899774
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x5CCD3D25
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x8F8B2ECC
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x486F1A37
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0xA96D9772
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x78C1E3E9
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x1E1EC03B

0x51EF4E84
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0xBB302E2F
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xB8D42BD8
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x797AC038
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x3F965684
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0xE712BDE2
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0x1FB6481E
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0xB5CBD0BC
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0xBADC8AA4
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x70B24C09
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x91243D10
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x332D8A14
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0xDBA700BE
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x1CC51A2F
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x70F138B4
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x001607B4
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0xFFAD05B8
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0x52A7DBE5
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0x63E3714F
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x3843EE97
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0xE5AAE198
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x2B6F5254
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0xC54A622D
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x39C65A0B
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0x7B78BC4B
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xC6BA55FD
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0x25D10E1C
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x762AB19C
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x347D9896
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xA2B2DC2F

0x51EF4E84
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x090A5E1B
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x9B47D564
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x04B6C7B7
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0xAF86BEC6
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x06040744
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0xDF31A9EE
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xC8E1D8B2
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x16F77CF5
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x8CA9BC1A
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x0F4D3537
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0xF65EB8A8
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0xBB01200D
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0xA638A6AE
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x04E34E9A
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x557009D1
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xE9A2E8E0
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x175267B3
selects a mate.
0x9CAC3C26

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0xF3828D1C
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x13A3155F
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0xE1CB0AA6

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0xA1503BB3

0x51EF4E84
"Nor am I."
0x6462D8DE

0x51EF4E84
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x467F4C6D
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0xDDC59C09

0x51EF4E84
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0xF22C29E0

0x51EF4E84
"You should have sent her to school."
0x5B5F8AEA

0x51EF4E84
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0xBDEDEF77

0x51EF4E84
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0xED565F70
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0xE757BB62
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x44077943
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0x6B975594

0x51EF4E84
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xEABAA7B7
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0xE206EA59
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0x5A90853C

0x51EF4E84
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0xEBF2EDEC
straight before him.
0x518FABC7

0x51EF4E84
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0x6B012A88
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0x0D27CB00
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0xC3A7AECE
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x233C63A6

0x51EF4E84
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x6C3A8A49

0x51EF4E84
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x15C05AD0
her question with an explanation.
0x9FF20782

0x51EF4E84
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0x2D27732C
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x53F22A15
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0xB1911E9B

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0x7FEE6BE8
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0x4B4F45D6
the anathematised race was present.
0x0570985D

0x51EF4E84
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0xD2A056D6
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0xDF5DC029
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x82683938

0x51EF4E84
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0xFEF9D40D

0x51EF4E84
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x42A19E07
three times with portentous significancy.
0x9E079058

0x51EF4E84
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0xD11BD7BB

0x51EF4E84
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0x59A9BCA8

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x9EBA4AE8
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x4C8F1529
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x384CBB8B
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x9AA06B79
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0xD246C1E0
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x5E349510
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x200D14C4
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x7E868512
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x91D5AFF7
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x3F07B0D5
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0xFF03AD1F
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0x885FCF35

0x51EF4E84
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0xE7FC61A7
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x81F12F42
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0xF7061A5D
when she was herself so ignorant."
0xAB05559F

0x51EF4E84
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x1D77851A
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0xC77AAF80
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0xA80495B3
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x622651D5
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0x0B9448EE
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0xC0D17B9F
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0x40F5668B
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0x94DC08D2
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0x71ED238F
lady-mother?"
0xCEC2A8BF

0x51EF4E84
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0x07349EAA
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0xA6E9D0EC
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0xC26958A7

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0xC8925B8E
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0x3B35B46F
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0xD84E3A86
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0xBAAE0D17
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0xBA8D9E25

0x51EF4E84
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0xAC32311D

0x51EF4E84
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0x6A10A3A0

0x51EF4E84
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0xCDE5FB97
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0xA4AAF130
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0xCCC355C3
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0x18DA9F69

0x51EF4E84
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0x8A329C6C
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x43A402BA
she would give us anything we asked for."
0xE369E049

0x51EF4E84
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0xDD9CD2FD
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0x11E0F710
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0xB9F511F2
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0x9BEB0F01

0x51EF4E84
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x050E6A05

0x51EF4E84
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x3477D89A
in voice to-night?"
0xE1574113

0x51EF4E84
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0x442FF79A

0x51EF4E84
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0x1F9BB96D
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x09BF2957

0x51EF4E84
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0x22316B5F

0x51EF4E84
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0x267528FC
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0x7C4FE9CE
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x30862E5B
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0x96A85F3F
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0xFDAAE3F5
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0x177C0347
hand."
0x5F6F1211

0x51EF4E84
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0x1C8C2E7E
Mr. Rochester.
0x11103661

0x51EF4E84
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0xED2FCC32

0x51EF4E84
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0x0E6E82B4

0x51EF4E84
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x9D816DE8
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x1259F115
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x31B59F60
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x13B71E78
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x1B5F2B95
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x439A25A1

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x8A22B93A
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0x2A00AF87
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0x8AA47502
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x574712ED
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0xFAFD1614
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0xDEAF3BE9
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x32F63A87
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x30648174
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x2EF8A95C
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x6E5632C7
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0xF6584773

0x51EF4E84
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0xF95E07C7
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x76265EF9
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0xD13C1757
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0xAC45223F
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0xE7B3904C

0x51EF4E84
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x963A7E43

0x51EF4E84
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0x9BC38D9C
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0x0D5DF9E1

0x51EF4E84
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0xC3A895F0
water."
0x0A62FEAB

0x51EF4E84
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0xFAD36CCA
such things _should_ be done."
0x1AF8BAA2

0x51EF4E84
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0x7A37B649
fail."
0x464DB20F

0x51EF4E84
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0x4019AA87
proportionate punishment."
0xF09E2642

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x5EA8B71C
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0xADABA3BE

0x51EF4E84
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xA3DC45AD

0x51EF4E84
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0x70A04611
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0x1188B976
capital punishment."
0x3307F16E

0x51EF4E84
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0xC4866974
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x7B8D5AA4

0x51EF4E84
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x23F7C462
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0xED0AB077
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0xC8DE51A5
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xCA30403B
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x37F6CD2A
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x92399C4F
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x6218A929
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x68335C80
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0xC4A13124
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x851BC4F8
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xF04AB6CC
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x00524522

0x51EF4E84
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x2DF69A38

0x51EF4E84
"I am very well, sir."
0x98C5B805

0x51EF4E84
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x672BC34F

0x51EF4E84
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0xA83BA347
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x11D6EAFE

0x51EF4E84
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x59832CFB

0x51EF4E84
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0xF8177F9B

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0xCAE68E20

0x51EF4E84
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x304C64E0
What is the matter?"
0xC748039B

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x7B0FBDC4

0x51EF4E84
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0xDE5AB12E

0x51EF4E84
"Not the least."
0x1201E871

0x51EF4E84
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0xA058CDF6

0x51EF4E84
"I am tired, sir."
0xB01E3EE3

0x51EF4E84
He looked at me for a minute.
0x0440DD01

0x51EF4E84
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x502F99D3

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x5DF4541D

0x51EF4E84
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x590987F4
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x113D428F
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0xBA69B99D
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x4F987EE7
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0xDF89C607
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x8FB4B1EF
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0xC433819F
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x147FC063
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
0x7771F42C

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XVIII
0xB5B9ACBC

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0xE5F83F92
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x69C7012F
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x8AA3C9D4
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x37D9C844
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0xB611366C
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x6AC9E64C
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x5B4E8247

0x51EF4E84
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xA17BE78F
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xBE5C7044
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x4E4867DA
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x73EE1A70
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xBFA4E2A5
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0xFF7B6151
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x5555B934

0x51EF4E84
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x6C9DE94F
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x6C479D3D
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x48C84CDF
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x1CBFD71B
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0x7EF1FACB
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x5BE2A504
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0xE6C7A118
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x3FA44C69
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x1D7A17B3
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0xB67A402F
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0xD6E434FB
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0xD3CA9E77
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x811A4914
drawing-room.
0xC015840E

0x51EF4E84
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x4E05383B
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0xDF890E9B
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x33D4C88E
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0x2E55DA3E
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0xF1971858

0x51EF4E84
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0x0E56EAAB
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0x6098346D
usual seat.
0x3AD71247

0x51EF4E84
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0xA8D667F4
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0xFB9A7DCF
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xEE96AA05
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x02F97039

0x51EF4E84
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x186EA9CA

0x51EF4E84
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xAC802143
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0xECEC0E08
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xD156CA97
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x4C8BD20E
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0xD61D442C
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x66BF8C78
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x68FCD906
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xAD690DE4
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x7636E6A1
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0xDE62F9AB
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x4D35D678
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x658B7695
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x61D9BA73
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x57441B62
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x93A24F67

0x51EF4E84
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0x5478B26E

0x51EF4E84
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0x2956F585
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x0D4E6D09
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0xFE881116
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x02AFAD1B
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x88981DEB
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0xD81FBCD5
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0xCDAD522F
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x32DB6A51

0x51EF4E84
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0xF76EEE3D
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x9765DAA9
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x0888E5D1
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0xFCCAB535
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xA8D07FC0
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x95FCAC3A
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0xBFF39817
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0xFD447CD1
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0xE4CD469D
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x7B87B135
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0xF5E9E86E
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x6770714C

0x51EF4E84
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x2940C24C
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x92F3EFC7
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0xE7E7F30E
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0x00C2F0A3
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x36231556
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0x20E198FE
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0xC04287BE
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x03870A8A
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0xB67F7788
wanting.
0x08856C90

0x51EF4E84
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x2BF4E858
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x098B29A7
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x3DBC0E7C
curtain again descended.
0xC0F0F203

0x51EF4E84
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x72ADB301
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x7C32BF44
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0xC77A241E
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0x2F27560F
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0x85FBF35D

0x51EF4E84
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x6E2AC7C0
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0xF3C7BE07
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0x4AF28E9C
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0x6101CFEC
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0x35233C08
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x7273CE4D
attached fetters.
0x401EC93A

0x51EF4E84
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0x003339C1

0x51EF4E84
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0xD0AA417F
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x15054560
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x303E0A7D

0x51EF4E84
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x56236DE6
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x0752A844
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0xE51749A7

0x51EF4E84
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x3D52FC4F

0x51EF4E84
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0xA6FFEDA6
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x6D61807E

0x51EF4E84
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0x8323E723

0x51EF4E84
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x1F2CA066
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x9C9083D5

0x51EF4E84
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xFF97B39B
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0x7A595486
colour rose.
0xBE15C24C

0x51EF4E84
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0x8481D3E0
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x6CE8B428
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0xA67D2F5A
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0xA7EA0F0B
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x6BEB58F8
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0xE4A19474
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x231D0E43
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0x3C276608
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0x997A51BB
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0x97646F15
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xE561B45C
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x255DFCC9
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xB6C6E2C1
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x9D893CB4
returns in memory at this moment.
0xF2C9DC03

0x51EF4E84
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0x4DFF2347
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0xD856E3F6
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0xAF7D303D
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0xCB2B3F76
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0xAB891553
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x2C63B90B
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0xB922C4E0
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x5622799F
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0xD0A91E80
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0xC130E0BE
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x5CD7929C
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0x95298D86
very pride, irresistible.
0x86A1453D

0x51EF4E84
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xA57CFFD0
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x6D317200
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x0C852364
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x3CB10850
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0xF723187E
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0xE0231EFD
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xAF7FB908
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0xA87FC81A
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x5988D917
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x92905632
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x102BEB02
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xAD8C518E
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0xBAAB6879
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x83987523
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x815D4A96
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xA6372CEB
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0xE4FEDBF8
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0xC775D4F7
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0x81E3D493
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x7214B0F0
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0xD9E97D44
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0xB93D080D
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x042FDD91
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x4FA7445B
torturing pain arose.
0x05E522F1

0x51EF4E84
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0xF7055E9F
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0x257F4F87
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0x97A5968D
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0xA3A911AB
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x46E881E8
not charm him_.
0x69489E8D

0x51EF4E84
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0xBB1F7166
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x36E95176
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0xA11136A9
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0xD2C778A5
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x03C73D15
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x2116450B
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0xEB339680
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x979DB6D4
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x353C9313
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x3450E612
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x98F625B6
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xFBAF3760
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x7DA7FBCA
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x5269D51F
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0xE798330F

0x51EF4E84
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xA1EB822B
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0x48D4EDF4
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0xA715B0DA
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x16500834
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0xC8BD946D
silent conquest might have been won.
0x948E05D0

0x51EF4E84
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0x7E641415
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0xF5FDD226
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x46C7E4A2
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x63DCDF92
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xE5F093F2
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0x22517318
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xE183051E
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0xE788A04E
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0xC68C0F15
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0x0EF5089D
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x6CEC889E
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x184E14ED
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0x1901E002
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x22394BD6
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x7D7C8BDB
shines on."
0x52D7746D

0x51EF4E84
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0xAC91EA25
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x02DE1502
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xF6002F3A
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xA2E6FEFC
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x298D416A
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x69DF1E25
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x61443ADE
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x67DB4C5D
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x46304CE3
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x01E8C91F
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xCFC0FFE7
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x9BFE99B5
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0xA2106722
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0xB9A5E889
as I wished to act.
0x176245B4

0x51EF4E84
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x35AE829D
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x0BDC6D3A
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0xDC6557A9
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x4F9D7777
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x7B71AF91
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0xA39DB6D9
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x25E8AF5D
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x8ECE3869
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x9A4ABBDC
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0xBDA1ADF3
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x68BA9D8C
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x48467E7F
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0xF8886D50
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x35B3AEBB
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x28692820
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x869DA285
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x3CA6B070
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x0749FF73
nature.
0x5E16F842

0x51EF4E84
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x1DCC4DE3
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xD1CCAAB7
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x243F9574
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x5F560800
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x8D781BA8
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x8F4DDD4B
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0xD3AD3A92
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0xEA8E85F5
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x180810A9
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xC93195B3
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x2A93C99D
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0xE671274D
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0xB5D3E57C
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xD7B14CF0
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x6548F7DF
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x1F387121
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x667A321A
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0xE8794EED
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x59D27193
vivacity of conversation.
0x9582DD60

0x51EF4E84
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x444F307E
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x3B9C724F
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0xC25DFFB7
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x4BAFBA79
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x94DFD7EB
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0xC546174F
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0xF3FA7329
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0x6F5CDEB7
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0xF1DF4467
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xF7AE7749
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0xC5CDDF53
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0xC432C016
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0x85DD1335
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x3DD8F933
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x27DAECFA

0x51EF4E84
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x3D16429C
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0x433A2212
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0xE09DEBFB

0x51EF4E84
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0xFFB0D56F

0x51EF4E84
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0x98D10E2B
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0xE06B81CA
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xD0C82D64
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x5C3A9D67

0x51EF4E84
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0xCEB5BA67
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0xFAA1D611
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x4586641D

0x51EF4E84
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x6D5A620E
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0xF71A643C
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x80E3EDF8
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0xB34E0BA1
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0xCB80121F
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0xD829760C
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0x1AAD8B13

0x51EF4E84
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x15A8276A
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x3F963A5F
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xE1655E8F

0x51EF4E84
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0xCA5C1E59
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xB9CCC1DC

0x51EF4E84
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0xB0F2129E
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x6DC2E80A
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x620FBE25
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x08BEEAF3

0x51EF4E84
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0x01B08393
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0xBE680AE9
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0xC910E09B
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x2DCDBF9F
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x019D8829
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0xFC9041CB
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x08B96E03
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x569D7186
least so I thought.
0x62C4C4DC

0x51EF4E84
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x836B7F20
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0x75422B1C
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x4CC391FC
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xC688B03D
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0x4D5397F2
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0x2E229647
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x65205C67
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x3245E40C
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xC55AD580
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0xA5206E54

0x51EF4E84
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x194B36A5
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x45803894
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x0B9A2EE3
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x432B5530
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0xA330EE16
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0xE19A1211
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x2DEB0DB4

0x51EF4E84
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0x016DFBD6
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x05206A72
that "extremes meet."
0xE245DA84

0x51EF4E84
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0xD42133C9
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0xE35DFB73
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x0F400AED
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x097B0BE8
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x084E8374
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x081FD0C2
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0xC304A0B3
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x53014907

0x51EF4E84
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0xB3B6EFAA
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0xE0DBF65F
a placid eye and smile!"
0xD4DAFF5F

0x51EF4E84
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x31A6200E
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x05BA8B40
Hay Common.
0x6CB732A8

0x51EF4E84
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x453F2986
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0xAB925AE0
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0x3E2E0B4B
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x1FF8A34A
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x2E8B70BD
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xC3FAAF3D
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x30527C75
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xF5B4C986
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x8A961EE4
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0x852AF549
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0xEFCA47FE
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0x1B45D340
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0x6EDEC5EE

0x51EF4E84
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x0D2C9649
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x9DDC5409
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0xE0A65C89
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xADCB4DB4
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0xC0612642
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x308B9958
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0x6DA1C0E2

0x51EF4E84
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0x248A8DBB
off," replied the magistrate.
0xAFC6638F

0x51EF4E84
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0x0FB06B0A
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x77F7DD44
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x388B6ED1
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0xE47627C7
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0xFF594D3B
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0x8FCFB3C3
see her?"
0xCB7FEF60

0x51EF4E84
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x7275AFFC
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x429A0791

0x51EF4E84
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0xACFAB3CE
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x78080881
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x96D4B08A
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x35B53F55

0x51EF4E84
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x48181031

0x51EF4E84
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x96371E18
must and will do it."
0xC0D7677B

0x51EF4E84
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x27A1A94A

0x51EF4E84
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0x7B0BE058

0x51EF4E84
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0x71CD6AAA
in, of course."
0xDD88AB46

0x51EF4E84
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x861FBCE3
throw away such a chance of fun."
0xF7C3AA68

0x51EF4E84
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0xD1DD4871

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0xB3A11171
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xA0158C41

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0xAD6BA91E
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x90A2E24C
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x4A5DC12F
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x338E56B7
forward."
0xC0B56BE3

0x51EF4E84
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0xD1AB0C48

0x51EF4E84
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x906E9F19
Sam!"
0x6B1DDB7F

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x691B0E6C
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x66449FD1

0x51EF4E84
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x20CA8813

0x51EF4E84
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0xFEC70F05

0x51EF4E84
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x22471C73
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0x0EFE7017

0x51EF4E84
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0xD196CD38
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x9FFF35C0
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x861EC555
one."
0xF117FBB1

0x51EF4E84
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x8BABADBA
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x91CA408A

0x51EF4E84
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x818AB697
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0xB2A8CBC3
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x215D25CF

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0xFB28D4F2

0x51EF4E84
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x28B6CB2A

0x51EF4E84
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x52966C65
once more.
0xB6D2A2B8

0x51EF4E84
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x8D0076E4
know who will be her first visitor."
0xF1C7FF84

0x51EF4E84
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0xA8EE4722
said Colonel Dent.
0xAD0FCB5B

0x51EF4E84
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x70A91FA5

0x51EF4E84
Sam went and returned.
0xBE58D006

0x51EF4E84
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x57516415
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x58621ECA
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0xD3D04284

0x51EF4E84
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0xB1D74BB6

0x51EF4E84
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0xAFF20B74
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x3A309145
of his men.
0x8EBC5FF6

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0x819103A2
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0xC3D8FA0A
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x2FBE6AD5

0x51EF4E84
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0x32816D71
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x81267E2E
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x6CD7A753
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x16C914FB

0x51EF4E84
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x940AF0C1
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0x670C28BC

0x51EF4E84
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x023DAD22
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xC5B1A287
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x44577FBD
her seat, and took it in silence.
0xB93B56B2

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0xB3E8E1A7

0x51EF4E84
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x802A6AAA

0x51EF4E84
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0x49D3667F
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xF74009FE

0x51EF4E84
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0xCB5468FD
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x4D2C65A9
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xBE9E0E68
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0xC825B1CD
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0xED3628DC
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x92E8B80F
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x33B17862
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xA7E56361
morning, as he threatened."
0xEFE4CFE8

0x51EF4E84
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x781F63A7
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x2396241F
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x38729356
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0xFA9E17BB
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x91A1FBA0
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x88913341
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x329AB25B
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xAFE571E7

0x51EF4E84
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0xA8EFCDF2

0x51EF4E84
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0xB0008B7A
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xE77B37E2
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0xE9EAF0A2
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x65F19794
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0x909293D9
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x19BAF054

0x51EF4E84
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xAAEE7C61
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xFF5DE8B1
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0x70964CCA
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0xFA26384D

0x51EF4E84
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xD027C0FD
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x60F86DC9
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0xD7064991

0x51EF4E84
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xBA9A3D87
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x4C7A47E1
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0xBEE4F970
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x2F201572
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0xAEA6EFF7
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0xA4F935ED
they most wished for.
0xBFEC8E08

0x51EF4E84
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x8423C95B
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0xAB8CB1AF
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x9A15DA2C
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0x9793DBBA
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x6007C9B9
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xBA67EE4A
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x16ABAB69

0x51EF4E84
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x850E6DF1
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x58836D59
saw Sam.
0x3C620A1E

0x51EF4E84
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0xAEA548E8
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xB26EAA16
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x2383555F
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0x9E4CF543

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0xF7C108FB
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x9A4925BF
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x973BB424
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0x7A445F0F
quietly behind me.
0x0A3AC7A3

0x51EF4E84
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0x70D198C1
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x818B3896

0x51EF4E84
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0xFFED8485
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x9853061F

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XIX
0xD93C3F50

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0xE82CC019
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0x575E6021
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0xB407752E
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x7A998BB8
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0xE77CE0A4
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0xAC07A67B
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0xBA0B4337
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0x262F6DBC
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x5F5E0537

0x51EF4E84
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x1386D8C9
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x0A6C1E9B
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x130470E4
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0xCC7BAD39
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x820F2404
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x80BB0813
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x35B50641
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0xBF6F9854
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0x2A1F85C2

0x51EF4E84
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x92A41F33
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0x7DD05D11

0x51EF4E84
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0x590ED191
warn you, I have no faith."
0x9F92C7EA

0x51EF4E84
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0x5E150226
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0x9CCB8140

0x51EF4E84
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0x84936B2B

0x51EF4E84
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x3E82B2FC

0x51EF4E84
"You need them all in your trade."
0x00778029

0x51EF4E84
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0xFF2DA769
you tremble?"
0x4A8BDA45

0x51EF4E84
"I'm not cold."
0x0254E479

0x51EF4E84
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0xC4D3503D

0x51EF4E84
"I am not sick."
0x97892BE4

0x51EF4E84
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0x6B0BD0D0

0x51EF4E84
"I'm not silly."
0xC6B95F31

0x51EF4E84
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x21AE55C1
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x773B4E2F
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x2BA2C97F
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0xA856FBD2
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x0C3F9A46

0x51EF4E84
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0x21A63121

0x51EF4E84
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x27802A97
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0xA219E61D
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x82724F2E
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x92D96030
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x3F5E9B1A
you."
0x1DCA8A53

0x51EF4E84
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x67942FD9
with vigour.
0x09799C91

0x51EF4E84
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0x255B3A16
solitary dependent in a great house."
0x43B27360

0x51EF4E84
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0xA2B55FF0
one?"
0x8A6F96F6

0x51EF4E84
"In my circumstances."
0xBD0E5D74

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x26941C16
placed as you are."
0xAEEAED17

0x51EF4E84
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x9B5B3A47

0x51EF4E84
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0xC9045136
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0xEB0063F6
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0x5D42F07A
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0xD3FDB679

0x51EF4E84
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0x28B4A3B7

0x51EF4E84
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0xF3525B9A

0x51EF4E84
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x4E943890

0x51EF4E84
"To be sure."
0x944D9E37

0x51EF4E84
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x665E7D4E
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0x0D673A8B
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0xABEF31BB
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0x299712A9

0x51EF4E84
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xFB10C6CA
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0xD8515432
there."
0x62E72D52

0x51EF4E84
"I believe you," said I.
0xF3DB7503

0x51EF4E84
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x70F3087A
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0xD40F0376

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x826BDD50
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xB83563DC

0x51EF4E84
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x847431E1
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0x64E9DEBD
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x4AA57B36

0x51EF4E84
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x02B6FA7F
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0xC9D0955C
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0xF1EECB19
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x415AD260
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0x6E35D638
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0x52F4CC18

0x51EF4E84
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0x8E999760

0x51EF4E84
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0x748FF2C4
whispers of the future?"
0xE90D93A3

0x51EF4E84
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x903D46E6
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0x19E3106C

0x51EF4E84
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0x962BA98D
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x2FA37194

0x51EF4E84
"You have learned them from the servants."
0x8DF5081E

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0x0AC45D47
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x35588F77

0x51EF4E84
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0xD1C86D64

0x51EF4E84
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0xC21A059B
after all, then!"
0x3D9D8ED6

0x51EF4E84
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0x2EA4CA24
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0xD160DEFE
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x42F4FF98
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0x70871D65
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0x1D474761
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0xB3CA599C

0x51EF4E84
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x48EF83AF

0x51EF4E84
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0xD51D0712

0x51EF4E84
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0x92739AFE
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0xD9A4D9D4

0x51EF4E84
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0x3EE2187A

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0x7AF8AF31
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0xBF4A22F2

0x51EF4E84
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0x6896ADCE

0x51EF4E84
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0xA090CE2D

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x29D53319
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x95318130
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0xCF2A97D3

0x51EF4E84
"I what?"
0x31E6F18C

0x51EF4E84
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0xA738D7B9

0x51EF4E84
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x08806CF7
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x854648F3
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0x1046D398
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x39F159D3
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0xEFEB97C6
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0x549B4633

0x51EF4E84
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0xDCF9BA58
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x9835F808

0x51EF4E84
"He is not at home."
0x26A5E283

0x51EF4E84
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0x329FACDA
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x32C74F97
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x180A11EF
it were, out of existence?"
0x509FF3B6

0x51EF4E84
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0x70FFBEA1
you had introduced."
0x955F6B8F

0x51EF4E84
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0x1905986A
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0xF40CCC19
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0xCE7F564E

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0x3AC10E89

0x51EF4E84
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0x67697556
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0x884A25E6
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0x31077FAF

0x51EF4E84
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0x78AE5EE1
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0x14DCE1D7
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0x81CA2877
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x0383887B
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0x8D0A6D3B
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0x218683DD

0x51EF4E84
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0x024490FF
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0xCBB007C1
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0x975A983E
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0xBA735642
noticed this?"
0xF5BBC3A9

0x51EF4E84
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x29356B24

0x51EF4E84
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0x637580B7
gratitude?"
0xE216C1AC

0x51EF4E84
I said nothing.
0x9D3B0CF7

0x51EF4E84
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x9F8E6B0D
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0x704A0829

0x51EF4E84
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0xA1521840

0x51EF4E84
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0x56FFF5ED

0x51EF4E84
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0xE3C076C5
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0xFB8B9CE7

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x69FDA935

0x51EF4E84
"Shortly?"
0xFEE09DE9

0x51EF4E84
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0x71AAA9F2
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0x5A523C2B
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0xEED59CA7
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x0FD0E1E8
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0xD3B3D375
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0xCC3A5ED9
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0x3316BA91
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0xCBC617EA
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0xCDF18B0B
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0xAA87607F

0x51EF4E84
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0xB86F1D2E
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0xA2A8E4E3

0x51EF4E84
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0x62F59EAE
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0x7F15FAD0
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0x7B3FACB9
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x83127319
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0x9270A2CB
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0x21D137CE

0x51EF4E84
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0x459753D0

0x51EF4E84
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0x09A7C10A
p190.jpg}
0x14B9F9EA

0x51EF4E84
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x83923E77
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0x6EABA66C

0x51EF4E84
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0x8C645D79
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0x69F2B6EC
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0xF47624C4
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0x7AFAF49E
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x4457F1DF
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0xA7CFEC0B
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0x70E69458
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0x368DBC0B
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xBF39E8FB

0x51EF4E84
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0x918EA4C8
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0xA1EF7EF1
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0xCA1E2C8D
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0x9C0BA17C
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0x954D011D
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0xB0AF7115

0x51EF4E84
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0xC44FA5B8
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0x3C202290
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0xAD6DDFA6
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0xD72680E7
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0xA2611979
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0x5FE49355
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0x1DC68A62
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0xE74E77C1
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x5D9EB3CE
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0xB68847CF
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0x3EB5236A
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x4AD8E461
dictates of conscience.'
0x590BA53E

0x51EF4E84
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x024A9733
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0x3E842FA5
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0x493A50A3
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0x9AFE00FB
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0xA39F674E
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0xE17C306B
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0x8E2F811E
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x9803C614
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0x22215D5D
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0x04AD83DC
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0xAA3D2883
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0xFC5B0AF6
me; the play is played out'."
0xF363E1DF

0x51EF4E84
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x29F9E02E
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0x02068D25
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0xD27F31BC
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x3083B232
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0x6BAB6AAF
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0xDB713209
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0xC15B2F2F
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x9F117DAD
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0x0DD97966
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0x6D971873
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0xAE53CBE7
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x645F1261
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0xE8070CA2

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x5FFD6C1F

0x51EF4E84
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0x2581EBF8

0x51EF4E84
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x0B5982D4

0x51EF4E84
"Break it, sir."
0xBA3731A5

0x51EF4E84
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x8931AA72
disguise.
0xA903843F

0x51EF4E84
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0xA8E40A51

0x51EF4E84
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0xBCB4CAAC

0x51EF4E84
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x5832F2A6

0x51EF4E84
"But not with you?"
0x875519E3

0x51EF4E84
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0xC70561A3

0x51EF4E84
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0xF57E5249

0x51EF4E84
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x18416A2B
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0x2A8EEB59
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x877452AC

0x51EF4E84
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0x293894DF

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x7991D77A
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x9DFC1E43
but it was not right."
0xA64E76F2

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0x06337577

0x51EF4E84
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0xAE6CA4DE
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x26E2261E
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0x2F03EB4A
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0x7FDF7C83
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x3C08B379
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0x4B07FE28
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xF6288A10
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x5A051F76

0x51EF4E84
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x6556BEA1
signify?"
0x7D40A3B2

0x51EF4E84
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0xDDFEB4FB
now, I suppose?"
0x1EF4BC06

0x51EF4E84
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0x819F7182
yonder are doing."
0x852135F7

0x51EF4E84
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0xEA86C6FE

0x51EF4E84
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0xFD997FE9

0x51EF4E84
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x1BEEF432
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0xA8169D1B
left this morning?"
0x9A09681F

0x51EF4E84
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0x64B54F9F

0x51EF4E84
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x7B53A163
installing himself here till you returned."
0x3F334C4E

0x51EF4E84
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x454CE79B

0x51EF4E84
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x46BCEB30
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x9242AC7E

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0xA0F76FC1
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0xCA322998
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0xF9901E53

0x51EF4E84
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x7C8D96CC
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x2A1CA46D
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x430AB36B
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0xA5C2D4DA
seemed to know what he was doing.
0xEE093CD8

0x51EF4E84
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0x76774972

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x1CA7D552

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x43E9DCB6

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x50481B70

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0x4752A109

0x51EF4E84
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x505FFD7A
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0xAD2BB332
and dreary look.
0x3CAAB2BC

0x51EF4E84
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0xD3A3910A
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x22A40497

0x51EF4E84
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0xD2259D64

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x5C7B0346

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x44072E5E

0x51EF4E84
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x0DC292BE
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x339861DC
doing."
0x8801C899

0x51EF4E84
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x175EFE94
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x6B6F9CBE
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x75C09276
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x039D097F
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xD8FF1CDB
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x504D3680
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xBDBF3F95
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xA0874D50
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0xE6CDC787

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x0BDCB657
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x8217AEA6

0x51EF4E84
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x6B79BE46
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x625A37BF

0x51EF4E84
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0x1607B27C

0x51EF4E84
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0xC1BA218B
strange?"
0xF9DA7FE2

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x2005460A

0x51EF4E84
"And Mason?"
0x5372FAC5

0x51EF4E84
"He was laughing too."
0xD383AEED

0x51EF4E84
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xB63B9289
Jane?"
0xBC06A339

0x51EF4E84
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x3E56858D

0x51EF4E84
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x69BBB042
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x34D78E24
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x3DBA90E5

0x51EF4E84
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x9BED51B2
you."
0x1DCA8A53

0x51EF4E84
"To comfort me?"
0xBB5C0068

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x96FF1B4A

0x51EF4E84
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0xA4F9840A

0x51EF4E84
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x3B2CA92F
care nothing about it."
0xD0CB5F03

0x51EF4E84
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x358D1EC7

0x51EF4E84
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x5FB76266
you, I am sure, do."
0x1F4EF0EB

0x51EF4E84
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0x1FCB58B8
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x7BF93960
and then leave me."
0xAB765EE5

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xAA3E94D3
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x49E2A6E2
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x89DD19D1

0x51EF4E84
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0xC07F3AC9
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x61B3C2F2
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x07735720

0x51EF4E84
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0x96C492AC
asleep.
0x8DDFE370

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XX
0xEF902872

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0xD863CD2B
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x0D6CF6EA
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xA8764862
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x8AC32112
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x99227A3B
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x6FE611A7
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0xEC48A2D9
the curtain.
0xBA8F57D7

0x51EF4E84
Good God!  What a cry!
0x864242BB

0x51EF4E84
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0xDD52F1EA
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0xC3F56080

0x51EF4E84
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0x2476806C
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x687D2379
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x6C6BFAAB
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xE7B76B70
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x6D14987F
it could repeat the effort.
0x39B39D77

0x51EF4E84
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xC66F78A3
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x2CD5127E
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x6AE57D68
voice shouted--
0x7AD91F80

0x51EF4E84
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x14BC31C2

0x51EF4E84
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x99BE7219
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x34C03FB3

0x51EF4E84
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xD3E1AC4C

0x51EF4E84
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0x34B14131
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0x42A5FF40
was silence.
0x0B6F8884

0x51EF4E84
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0x51BA7DE7
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0xF876DFF6
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x0A4E55C7
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x41FECBCA
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0xD5840108
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x54E5A24B
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0xEFBCEAFB
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x2C4F3A49
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x57EBC031
confusion was inextricable.
0x0AE71726

0x51EF4E84
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0xD1400B05
in his bed."
0x3D4A3AC8

0x51EF4E84
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xE680689C
coming."
0x82CAD50F

0x51EF4E84
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x630E6CB7
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0xBE195792
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x08AC4958

0x51EF4E84
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0xE28F0EEE
worst at once!"
0x75B48CD8

0x51EF4E84
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x57F2842E
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xFCE88D65
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xA0837D84

0x51EF4E84
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x59BCF1DA
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x008A745F

0x51EF4E84
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0x5E03721F
by an effort, he added--
0xB07A5D5E

0x51EF4E84
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x124B7A93
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x404C2723
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0xE7472751
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x8BD89B11
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0x224B59CC
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x3ED947B1
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x23A1F1F9
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x134D801D
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x595C2A4C

0x51EF4E84
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x097A64C7
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x47FF2B00
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x1A75DEFC
had left it.
0x14A9DFB9

0x51EF4E84
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x7F0B8E8E
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x5342C4AE
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x8E82C60F
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x72EC2BA6
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xA1CB8C97
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0x650390B3
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x52BA3C36
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x071450FA
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0xAB4CF356
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x689FF7C9

0x51EF4E84
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x4C71D68D
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0xAA52AC56
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x0EC3EF95
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0xA106366A
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0xD71BF0C1
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0xA1029AD6
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x15292CC7

0x51EF4E84
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0xEC16CAC4

0x51EF4E84
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x87FB4498

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And dressed?"
0xB0919D83

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x538C78DD

0x51EF4E84
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x72802937

0x51EF4E84
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x3514D351
noise."
0x902121A8

0x51EF4E84
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x9A4FEBA0
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x4D212A7B
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x7B58244C
side.
0x340C1DF8

0x51EF4E84
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0xCBDE1F48

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x49EEF23F

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Go back and fetch both."
0x7F401D7E

0x51EF4E84
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0xCC36DED4
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x28733254
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x6AEDC4BA
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xBA9A40FD

0x51EF4E84
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0xAE7B3F3B

0x51EF4E84
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0x3FAC5C6C

0x51EF4E84
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0xB3D53BD3

0x51EF4E84
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x24339757
fit."
0x298428CB

0x51EF4E84
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0xBB4287E9
the key and opened the door.
0x88A52B0C

0x51EF4E84
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x9E0BC6FA
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x7B37891D
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0xD2F40C2B
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0xB7C1B0BF
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0xFBB9640F
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x04D028FC
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0xADBE9991
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0xD3B63C50
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0x26B55152
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x08D1884E
came out and closed the door behind him.
0xD986C13F

0x51EF4E84
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x9CD7CC93
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x22C2CED5
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x280F7DD4
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x9A743DA6
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x4968AC43
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0x227DE9F4
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x805C6FBC
blood.
0xDDA8371A

0x51EF4E84
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x861FD953
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0xD2253573
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xB15D5C1E
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0xB00730FA
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0xDFB46386
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xFC23075D
blood, trickling fast down.
0x73742B0F

0x51EF4E84
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0xB290A970

0x51EF4E84
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xFF81F55B
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0x406D6116
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xF0B51951

0x51EF4E84
"Sir?"
0x2E978866

0x51EF4E84
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x197B53C1
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x8B1BA1B7
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x43DD6143
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0x6AB60E73
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x41BA3A1A
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x9FF69C63
consequences."
0x79FDD6F8

0x51EF4E84
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0xC16A733E
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0x12246A97
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x67A21F49
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0xBA4D0F4F
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0xB2036B82
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0xA38E890F
step ceased to be heard.
0xBEAE90CC

0x51EF4E84
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xADE4C4F3
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x74FE518F
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x89484CAC
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x14464410
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0xCABD6854

0x51EF4E84
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x7A6DE163
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0xCC63A79F
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xA445F431
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0xA19C8A01
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0x12F35C58
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xAFF8BD99
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0xC6E3435E
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0xE53A5E94
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x41C5DA6C
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0xF68707E9
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x1AE4F4AF
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x2B387945

0x51EF4E84
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0xD02599FA
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x3EF0F92D
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x3B0970A5
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0x5F104050
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0xD3855B49
subordinate's form.
0x52C00974

0x51EF4E84
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x2C1FE1DC
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0xA52F2096
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x0F3FBA6F
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0x0460EEC2
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x2FBE19F7

0x51EF4E84
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x948F1EF0
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x2E6130EC
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0xE4C0EDF5
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0xF4EC1318
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x385F09E9
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xE44BECDA

0x51EF4E84
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xF305A1C0
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x4801425A
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x2FD6F649
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x3D16C3AD
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x9F6B3EA1
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0x7074F680
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xBC07E97C
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x886A7F7F
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x781B6EEF
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xABC14586
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x604EBEE8
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x18D4B26A
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0xE81ABB31
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x608B1C89
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0xC520AEE8
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x9AB083D4
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x140C1ECD
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x197B08AE
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0x07FCDBDE

0x51EF4E84
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x0E083F79
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0xDFB14930
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x2D6C9708
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0x8164AC16
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0xDE942A19

0x51EF4E84
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0x53970DA4
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x005BF5FA
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x00AEB82B
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0x4FE6ACE9
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xF139222E
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x818E8D1E
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xD9B2B295
I might not even speak to him.
0xC2EEB8C1

0x51EF4E84
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x9B44C06A
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xDBFF0FD9
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x66675641
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0xFE90435C
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xDACCA636
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x6C597AE3
shorter.
0x6424C190

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0xC5D11405

0x51EF4E84
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0xA9C507F5
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x2220596D
patient downstairs and all."
0x45877E3B

0x51EF4E84
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0xE7AD30ED

0x51EF4E84
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x517E5F6F
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x52F210A4

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x70E66E05
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0xEAF0D1DD
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0xF0616781
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x2C52A1C8

0x51EF4E84
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x945B9DD3

0x51EF4E84
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xE4446C43

0x51EF4E84
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x114B977F
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0xA70FFE2B
there's no danger."
0x74EB0D5F

0x51EF4E84
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0xBFFAF181
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0x1148DB6F
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x132A4749
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0xE09BCE26
here!"
0x3545AF0A

0x51EF4E84
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x31027635
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x6F5A165B

0x51EF4E84
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0xCE631C89
said Mr. Rochester.
0xB37C52DF

0x51EF4E84
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x5DBB065A
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0xA0D4FA08
looked so quiet at first."
0xFBDF9345

0x51EF4E84
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0xA9B1B2D4
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x0D700CD2
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x3332B012
alone."
0x75F7D324

0x51EF4E84
"I thought I could have done some good."
0x35DC2F55

0x51EF4E84
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0xCBAB18F5
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x607EA1C0
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0x48C1DC7A
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xFF99363F

0x51EF4E84
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x7A08C93B
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x696F312E

0x51EF4E84
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x2A5270C4

0x51EF4E84
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x386BD923
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x365EA8B9
said--
0xA747663A

0x51EF4E84
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0xF2AD8E5A
it."
0x9A0BD2ED

0x51EF4E84
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x12C8644C

0x51EF4E84
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x84458A67
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0xF94EAA2F
think of her at all."
0x377F375E

0x51EF4E84
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0x2B861633

0x51EF4E84
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0x86EED57A
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0x228882BB
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x8102920E
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xCE112025
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0xA7BFF5C6
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x829A4EBB
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x25879869

0x51EF4E84
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0xEACBAAAA
and returned with them.
0xB8A537CD

0x51EF4E84
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0x6E81452E
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0xE8AE88B0

0x51EF4E84
I retired as directed.
0x85E7E975

0x51EF4E84
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x210B2807
Rochester presently.
0x9AB69480

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir; all was very still."
0xEBA8764E

0x51EF4E84
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0xF88A572E
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x6110E09A
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x8155DA02
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0x83275242
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x6E2351B2
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0x717286A3
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x5254B0EE

0x51EF4E84
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x0509274F
edged with fur.
0xAE6DF2C1

0x51EF4E84
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0x349680C7
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x36CB8245
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xE273DA71
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x2716CF15
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xD8D1FCAD

0x51EF4E84
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x8A3809EC

0x51EF4E84
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0xCF9AE48C
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x5F4FA390
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x8282DFDD
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xBC8C9025
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0x4D687F17

0x51EF4E84
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x2E238915
the washstand.
0xFE138896

0x51EF4E84
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0xA83BC19F

0x51EF4E84
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0xA10BAEDC
to Mason.
0x260F55E5

0x51EF4E84
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x1965B6F1

0x51EF4E84
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0xDA8D163A

0x51EF4E84
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0xFD2C6415

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0x9E9389B1
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0xF1FEAF64
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0x14E50246
liquid; he then took his arm--
0xA3B4F69F

0x51EF4E84
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x7DEFC3DB

0x51EF4E84
The patient rose.
0x8777B83F

0x51EF4E84
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0xFBAB4BBC
step out--that's it!"
0x5F4C2931

0x51EF4E84
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x3A2AD6D2

0x51EF4E84
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xF545C891
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0xD9BF6467
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x900B462F
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x71E81CFB
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0xC7C10E94

0x51EF4E84
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x8E3E30B9
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x281F59E2
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x94ADC55F
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x4D6A7C17
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0xD784811E
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xDC3FF3F3
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0xDBADEF26
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0xB2E6A308
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0x147CDC34
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x2387C915
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x34284B62
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x6F27B47D

0x51EF4E84
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0xE110F111
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xA95610F8
chaise; Carter followed.
0x54F56AE1

0x51EF4E84
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0x200A56F7
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x9639453D
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x11CD738F

0x51EF4E84
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0xBCB4AAF0

0x51EF4E84
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x99175F59
Dick."
0xD89575EB

0x51EF4E84
"Fairfax--"
0x5BD9612A

0x51EF4E84
"Well what is it?"
0x07A90CAA

0x51EF4E84
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x5454F2B5
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xA81AA921

0x51EF4E84
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x0D1BAF5E
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x266BB14E

0x51EF4E84
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0xCE3D1AA7
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0xEA03DC8D

0x51EF4E84
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xA901B750
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x5F20AD72
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0xE64994AE
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0xFD29D636

0x51EF4E84
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x58496E74
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x575DACC9

0x51EF4E84
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x33D13F7C

0x51EF4E84
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0x39E82AD6
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0xF39FBF1A
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x92EE3A49
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0x5A0997D3
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0xEF81B832
pure."
0x33446006

0x51EF4E84
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x52EFA59C
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x55F9F8CC
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0xC6D5A8A7
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0xD570EA2A
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x18797B65
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0xBB882144
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x39D097A1
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x58932D90

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x97BE5645

0x51EF4E84
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0x128513B0
me.
0x75545466

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you, sir."
0xA5A093FF

0x51EF4E84
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x3D3D59E8
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x1FE1117E
atmosphere?"
0x99EBF676

0x51EF4E84
"I do, very much."
0x668DC6CF

0x51EF4E84
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0xA1ADB06B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0xF4419A52
with Mason?"
0x025746DD

0x51EF4E84
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x435D297B

0x51EF4E84
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x75726B89
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x36C07688
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0x73C1787F

0x51EF4E84
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x5CFD41C6

0x51EF4E84
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0xA7D312B8
thoughts."
0x71859885

0x51EF4E84
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0x7DC7BF1D

0x51EF4E84
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0x34D8899A

0x51EF4E84
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0xED9A2184

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0x1E3645F0
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x2C9EA551
spue fire any day."
0x00509C1C

0x51EF4E84
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0xB3582913
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0xB872B773
you."
0x1DCA8A53

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0x5A287DE1
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x370608DC
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0xF91BF755

0x51EF4E84
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x67D75EA1
how to avert the danger."
0xBF23E023

0x51EF4E84
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0xB450E39D
from him.
0xEC2BD87D

0x51EF4E84
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0x5623C426
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0xB3646AF9
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xA8D4A0DE
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0xF6C60EA0
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0xA8965446
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0x2A1B5A69
friend, are you not?"
0x08D1F028

0x51EF4E84
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x614A7341

0x51EF4E84
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0xF5899940
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0xFDBDE2A0
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0x35BC15BC
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0x9C37588C
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0xE06E01C5
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x2828A536
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xFB8FDC87
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x2441D03F
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0xB3BAE828
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x8A1235C5
me at once."
0x4BB7DA16

0x51EF4E84
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x09E604EF
you are very safe."
0xA8513C4F

0x51EF4E84
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0xAA7D17C5

0x51EF4E84
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x7698E9B9
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0x4C8602BC
before him.
0x5F7F793F

0x51EF4E84
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x0FED43B5
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0xA4AF2E69

0x51EF4E84
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x23FB6514

0x51EF4E84
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0xEA9E12F1
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0x7EE9F574
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0xE4334C45
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0xA9AD5456
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0xBCE7F043
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x07F48ADB

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir; I am content."
0xFEB93DF5

0x51EF4E84
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xC98A6E72
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x8A586F08
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x9ACDAE87
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0xEC23DC0C
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0xFB28990B
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x8DDE3EF7
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0x6247EDD0
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0x0F0C6E39
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xF14B02E8
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0xBA41310F
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0xE29855CD
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0x5E6422E0
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0xAC5CA0C9
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x552CEC44
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0xE2C2EFB1
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x67494196
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x9474F043
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x474CB7F7
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x9CC457A0
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0xC861F837
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x61CEE9B7
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0x072EEA4E
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0xB8C7821A
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0xB7B06943
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x5E46BE7E
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x948E030B
judgment approves?"
0xE468CC7A

0x51EF4E84
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0xA062E4E2
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xF23D4E49
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x749DE63A
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x6FC967D8
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x705108D9

0x51EF4E84
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0x3B89E9F7

0x51EF4E84
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0xF6DD611C
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x886722FE
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0xB5E5BFA0
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xA3BD1F8C

0x51EF4E84
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x99489134
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x29CCC67C
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0xD7234EF5
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x60EAC929
amend and solace to heal."
0x78E26DED

0x51EF4E84
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x0CE22EBB
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x8C065C07
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x19FD534A
instrument for my cure in--"
0x697F74EB

0x51EF4E84
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xCC81A44B
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x82C801BB
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x2D11C510
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0x0A73B31C
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0xE4778481

0x51EF4E84
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x50360F82
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0x5E7068B2
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x50622FE2
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0x00831F95

0x51EF4E84
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x80259FAF
came back he was humming a tune.
0x597A90D8

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x407C69F1
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0xEE8EDC6E

0x51EF4E84
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x39AE12E9

0x51EF4E84
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x36FD1CA5
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xF486EC82
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x67310789

0x51EF4E84
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0x3990553A

0x51EF4E84
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0xB65AAC6A
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0xC167212C
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0xBE758AE2

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x5B207AE2

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x2D69FEFB
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0xFC49AEF2
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0xFE7F9AA7

0x51EF4E84
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0xFAAB6ED0
cheerfully--
0xEE132909

0x51EF4E84
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0x92CEDD94
I rose at four to see him off."
0x7C7E7D9D

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXI
0x095BBAC5

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x4E737DFD
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x24277103
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x555019A2
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0xCD4A18D1
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x596B9D7B
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x2754EB95
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x1F36C8D6
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0xEB3EA1F4
man.
0x0C1C79B4

0x51EF4E84
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0x4263D6B9
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x0FF9F42A
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0xE166EA03
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x3AD81993
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0x0ADBA5D1
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x782B5319
little sister.
0xB2C2CE99

0x51EF4E84
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0x0D0BC938
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xEB7739CF
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x826FF7FC
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xE4EB1649
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x0602EEAB
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x46B0412B
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x5515EF64
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x247842E6
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0xB5127861

0x51EF4E84
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x86ED974A
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x2266CC74
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x61E2E5E1
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x8FB2EB25
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0x13B8016D
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xD0911615
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0x73CF79C6
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x25B9312D
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x1E8D61D6

0x51EF4E84
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xDD7F81C9
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0xB1D6B6E1
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0x10F459E7

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x2A0E4F31
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x3DAA0872
are married to Bessie?"
0xFC0A6FC6

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xF1956D75
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x96D45EEB
child are thriving."
0xD2F40EB4

0x51EF4E84
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0xAD1C3124

0x51EF4E84
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x84722F2C
badly at present--in great trouble."
0x3271B9F6

0x51EF4E84
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0xBA822D65
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x36D9E610

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xEE26A939

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. John?"
0xEC148767

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x0865D00E

0x51EF4E84
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x3669B49D
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0xF96D1C68
his death was shocking."
0xE9474C24

0x51EF4E84
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x0B9ADC0E

0x51EF4E84
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0xAFEE7AB6
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0xEAC711AD
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x91678644
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x0B6D51B4
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x5F9BB086
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0xEFED18FC
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0xD70E0729
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x26924AEB
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0xFAD762C4

0x51EF4E84
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0xE41E5F34

0x51EF4E84
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x97659435
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x1D3DA6F8
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x4C4F9FDB
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x9011985B
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x71E2454C
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x48D7027A
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x7076F974
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0x7BADD3CB
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x9A3A406D
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x332905B2
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x7AD3F7B8
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x41E6F54E
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x49E4DB7F
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0x34F9BFDB
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x738A45B0
morning."
0xBE63C6FB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xA4E7837C

0x51EF4E84
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x2FC7BBA5
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x4A60F8D2

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0xD7CB4EFA
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x7268F194
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xB1D2014F

0x51EF4E84
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x5C7D9857
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x4FC9FB99
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x432D0576
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0xC88C1CE7
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x9B7BD263
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x0477268C
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xBC79C298
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xC5162766
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x7590C267
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0xF8EB0ED6
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0x3087A521
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0x63DD8E72
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0x73AB5337
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xF58F97EF
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xBB587FD6
lineaments.
0x91E68830

0x51EF4E84
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x9CDAC18B
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x09168538
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0x15236A86
cue and followed me from the room.
0x930AE139

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xC5B88099
which he had shut.
0x714FA82F

0x51EF4E84
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0x9271BA94

0x51EF4E84
"What to do?--where to go?"
0xBC0AE113

0x51EF4E84
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0x9D923825

0x51EF4E84
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x4517C10A

0x51EF4E84
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0xAB710E63

0x51EF4E84
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0x57B0F940
people to see her that distance?"
0x7D607DC2

0x51EF4E84
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0x04EDAB7C

0x51EF4E84
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0x707D55F6

0x51EF4E84
"It is his widow, sir."
0x2AAFAFCA

0x51EF4E84
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x63B23B61

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0x15AFEFC4

0x51EF4E84
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x9679389A
had no relations."
0x87BF0A0C

0x51EF4E84
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x334D2956
off."
0x6BD72929

0x51EF4E84
"Why?"
0x66842582

0x51EF4E84
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x0B476067

0x51EF4E84
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0x4004410C
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x3D797C6F
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0xB862D15B
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0x8482E2D4
in London."
0x975D5594

0x51EF4E84
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x657F3158
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0xB686ACAB
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0xCAD437FE

0x51EF4E84
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0x89417C35
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0xC83277D3
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x3BF936BA

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0x48411550
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0x044FC596

0x51EF4E84
"How long will you stay?"
0x35CBCCD2

0x51EF4E84
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0x83EB80FE

0x51EF4E84
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0xF535ACAE

0x51EF4E84
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0x2517FB7A

0x51EF4E84
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0x10541DA7
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0xA60735B3

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0xDD56343C

0x51EF4E84
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0xC7557CD8

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x6D1176FE

0x51EF4E84
"A person to be trusted?"
0x12D6E279

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0x426C470C

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0xA2B8A7F5

0x51EF4E84
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x0EB3DF2D

0x51EF4E84
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0xFF571E2A
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0x7EC77D99
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0xC11C37D4

0x51EF4E84
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x508B4FD5
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x5210339D
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0x39595457
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0xA7D3ECE3
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0x29A98C4F

0x51EF4E84
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0xED034E84

0x51EF4E84
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x91B84B72
if recollecting something, he said--
0x2F9A15F9

0x51EF4E84
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0x916FA665
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0xB48FCB42
plenty?"
0xFCDD43E8

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0x236C39EF

0x51EF4E84
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0x620879F3

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0x6F958982
while I have the opportunity."
0xDBD95C89

0x51EF4E84
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x1EE467E6

0x51EF4E84
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0xEB34AAEF
married?"
0x146092FF

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; what then?"
0x5D5A4FF5

0x51EF4E84
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0xD26AF44C
perceive the necessity of it."
0x05217363

0x51EF4E84
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x0BC20C74
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0xF9A0D339
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0xDEC3A17B
straight to--the devil?"
0x60E596D4

0x51EF4E84
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0xD66B7FE6

0x51EF4E84
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0x4B7350AA
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0xF49C097C

0x51EF4E84
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0x5B4B041F
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0xA34AFF44

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0xCA3E7C1A
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0x61D94D49

0x51EF4E84
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0x85A2F542
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0xB9AA7E91
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x6705BB80

0x51EF4E84
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0xDBB8E9C2
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0x4F2A51AD

0x51EF4E84
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0x72B82DF2
five pounds, Jane."
0xE7B14C64

0x51EF4E84
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0x6638D05E

0x51EF4E84
"Just let me look at the cash."
0x548BA3A8

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0x253F5093

0x51EF4E84
"Jane!"
0xC3360555

0x51EF4E84
"Sir?"
0x2E978866

0x51EF4E84
"Promise me one thing."
0xE64C7160

0x51EF4E84
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0xB8888EDC

0x51EF4E84
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0xFC38DF9D
find you one in time."
0x7AD9B09E

0x51EF4E84
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0xB93961C9
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0xD52CF334
it."
0x9A0BD2ED

0x51EF4E84
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0xAC0CDE7A
then?"
0xBE705F29

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir; early."
0xA1DDBE5E

0x51EF4E84
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0x43BFE25B

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0xAEAF0A80

0x51EF4E84
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0xD6CFD933

0x51EF4E84
"I suppose so, sir."
0x23F50AD4

0x51EF4E84
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0xF6F4CBF6
not quite up to it."
0x1C382261

0x51EF4E84
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0x846887C0

0x51EF4E84
"Then say it."
0x5F56D354

0x51EF4E84
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x87AC45CA

0x51EF4E84
"What must I say?"
0x156034B5

0x51EF4E84
"The same, if you like, sir."
0xCEE71BCA

0x51EF4E84
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0x3A1C61A5

0x51EF4E84
"Yes?"
0x02D59BB5

0x51EF4E84
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0x6D04E24D
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x38D3AA0D
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0x687796D5
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0x12C391D1

0x51EF4E84
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0x07B6A3F1
as in many."
0xA0002BB0

0x51EF4E84
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0xCCA05F55

0x51EF4E84
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0xA73A0538
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xBAEB0541
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x39BD0047
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x61D262DD

0x51EF4E84
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0x0AABA123
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x92C24B08
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0x245C3377
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xB4CA7582
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xF0B38CA1
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x4C336CAD

0x51EF4E84
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0x86E620F4

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0xC4412C66
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x0EA1060B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0xA78796AF
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0xCA0C3C25
will finally recover."
0xF536C374

0x51EF4E84
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0xC35B85EC

0x51EF4E84
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x74AAD806
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x353C9418
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0xAAB57D83
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0x8E28DC09
and then I will go up with you?"
0x667ABFFB

0x51EF4E84
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0xD7A4F21F
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0xD78A9B93
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x25455DA7
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0xE52971CC
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0xD51B8183

0x51EF4E84
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0xAB454C1D
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0xFE741D23
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x99F2FDF6
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x39D9A58A
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xC1C596E4
looks.
0xCD44D13C

0x51EF4E84
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x6162EEEC
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x4A3E767A
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x2FE0296B
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xCE6ED596
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x0587BA46
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x88212AFB

0x51EF4E84
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0xD5FA28D2
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0xB7F3800B
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x86C0EA6F
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0xDDB810E3
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0xDF41B3CE
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x28ACA9BC
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x329F4993

0x51EF4E84
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0xFB19419A
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x2F9E00C9
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0xE84B7FA8
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x4E6B0B2D
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0xE63B0F49
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x94286E6A
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x7EC9BCAA
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0xCF73BF69
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0xC60E7538
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x7FC2A178
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xAA33812F
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0x9CC037CB

0x51EF4E84
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x3D5E1116
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x36A0E6D8

0x51EF4E84
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x6140F1D1
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0x0E0E8C76
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x1060FA51
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x9F3DEED1
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x5595D2C2
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0xE3515AD2
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x466C8DAA
past recognition.
0x6E6656E8

0x51EF4E84
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xC5DA9ECE
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x9EB2C230
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0x25A6F40F
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x7621342B
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0xB4F152EB
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0x08B4BE2F
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x076887E8
colourless visage.
0xC6E735AE

0x51EF4E84
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x230D49C7
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x255977C9
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0xD118A8CC
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x2DCB6968
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0x249A0089
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0xB1331F4D
other's looked puritanical.
0xBE615441

0x51EF4E84
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xEF46AABA
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0x36D99DEC
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0xB62BB092
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x198354C7
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x5F45BDC4

0x51EF4E84
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0xD9F82E25
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0xCA4636CB
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0xD8F3A589
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xE8926AC9
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x743481DF
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x52435267
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xED543391
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x1FD020F7
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0x692DB8A5
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x85BFD9E0
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0x92E42EF7
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0x4B32A544
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0xE021BA63

0x51EF4E84
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x31B0BDB9
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x1237EB59
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0xAD607E97
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x32D8C88C
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x4AB5A35A
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0xF9A709DE
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0xEB0D41E4
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0xC881C0A5
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x9D32B694

0x51EF4E84
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x605859F2
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x205FE06C
liberty.
0xB9DCB71C

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x31A89F80
can see her to-night."
0xF94C16DD

0x51EF4E84
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x9CD4667C
should be much obliged to you."
0x7667013A

0x51EF4E84
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0xCD8CE920
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x83D2B413
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x4D07F5EA

0x51EF4E84
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0x97C2235D
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x8DC0D95D
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0xA0BA9A87
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0xAADA8172
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0xF99A7805
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x4108631D
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x2DA49362
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x01D08DDC
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x88DD6817
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0xB400B93D
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0xDEE817CA
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x3C958DC8
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x71C3D130
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x2D7E5C7C
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x0AAD9B31

0x51EF4E84
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x035C94B6
us see if she will know you."
0xAF5F44E8

0x51EF4E84
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0x842957FC
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x662449F9
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x3E444BF5
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0xBBEA6817
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0xEC0BADDC
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x579CE807
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x0AAEEABF
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0xEC2C0D80
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0xE05D14E2
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x9F2D38AE
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xC9C72540

0x51EF4E84
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x5AAB0A23
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x7CBC8490
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xB09CADC0
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x04B0312D
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x72DD7C88
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0xCE1DC150
amity.
0x122BFBDB

0x51EF4E84
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0xE8C3C182
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x0F156ED7
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x3A85011B
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x33181EC9
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0xA58C3F55
she looked at me.
0xB7CA2192

0x51EF4E84
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0xE59047E6

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0x60D4AB85

0x51EF4E84
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x6F9AA112
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0x78A105B5
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x2D7EDC8B
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0xA6675816
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x885AFEAB
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x89913032
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0xD1C09C2E
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0xFC2DA8E4
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x19FC8EC1
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0x4BEEE24E
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0xE42C7B4B
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0x4DB49D3C

0x51EF4E84
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xA61AACD9
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x0454BB7A
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x0F6A714F
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x362D11EF
the pillow.
0xE1CFB3B7

0x51EF4E84
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xEBC0E614
till I see how you get on."
0x88F17E89

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x730F1114

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xDC10D98E
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0xD6253A25
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x209A01E8
say--let me see--"
0x6C51AE18

0x51EF4E84
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0xE0B8E667
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0xFE50B17D
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x58365486
was at once irritated.
0xF8048007

0x51EF4E84
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0xC5D59978
you Jane Eyre?"
0xB9FA5B6B

0x51EF4E84
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x3F68DB81

0x51EF4E84
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x59BF1887
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x8502F369
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x1ACE1BAE
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0x74E89A9C
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x595EDF0A
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x3DD16AA5
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0xE4007224
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x364CD718
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x1EC9DAD2

0x51EF4E84
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x63BED0BD

0x51EF4E84
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0xB3B8B221
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x99550968
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0xFB2DE663
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x17192FCE
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x1FF525B8
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x77DC2C2A
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0xE4439162
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x709DCBE8
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0xB74FEFAC
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x03229A0E
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x4B12DB8A
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0xF0165E40
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x13DF18C4
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0xD46FD95C
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0xB5A99B28
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xC3E8EB51
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xCB79ECE0
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0x0EAC1853
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0xD1513C24
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x1F551AB9
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0xE17463B3
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x6FBCF699
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0x381AC552
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0xACA05D45

0x51EF4E84
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x720B3CE1
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x82428010

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0xC1D5652E
the morning she is calmer."
0xCA764D74

0x51EF4E84
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xEE504B6F
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x861BAD78
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x1D5DF830
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x968BF3B7
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x8C3723EE
had?"
0xCCDED374

0x51EF4E84
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x7D317312
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0xB0859B7A
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0x468280AF

0x51EF4E84
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0x7FB24FCC
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0x35CC03A5
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0xA767CB38
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x12C136E4
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0x93529275
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xA07D987D
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x2B5D8E14
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0xF1D63015
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0x9832348B
for both.
0x40E7F189

0x51EF4E84
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0xA4FEA12B
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x60FDDDB0
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x4FD0C309
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x27CD4606
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0xD6413BD8
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x07EEACB0
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0xD96C40ED
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0x91369EC2

0x51EF4E84
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x8EDDCB72
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x1E61C70B
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x84A8ADA7
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0xE2A3DEB6
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x43FF2AB2
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x18B16A3B
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x9D2221B1
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x7C99F0C3
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0x28B0DB67
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0xB57AE49E
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x83AF8583
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0x436CDFDD
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xE74D1A31
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x97255D3B
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x396D4EF8
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xDE5D0FAE
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x2C9B7B35
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0xA2ABE6C1
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0x942F41BD
and content.
0x3C380136

0x51EF4E84
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x2DEA707B
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0xE09CC1F2
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x438EFD84
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0x56C9D37E
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0xC7F14583
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0xAC94E528
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x0C0BCFC7
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0x1FEB2674
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x9774FF85
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0xDDD3E482
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x4EB68C3D
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xFF1CBA18
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0xA7DDDC28
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x0E4158A0
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0xFE0CC599
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x4D6210A5
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0x115161F5
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0x20792129
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x988E45F2
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x8F781344
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0xBD36D826
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x0A2AEF8B
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xAB1509D6
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0xE3AECA74
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0xC2F29653

0x51EF4E84
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x3C8805E2
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x0A039180
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0x7B7ED263
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x45780087
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xABC390CF
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x0A4CF419
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x5A63108B
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0x9FF0215F
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0xDCA2BE18
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x9A7F4CA6
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0x94889F42
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0xE72210F1
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x28A57BC4
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0xEC9FED5B
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x1AB24794
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x86F5F51F
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x5C1BDF3D
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x39E0D365

0x51EF4E84
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x23AD0C32
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0xC618027F
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0xAF0EF713
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x23CD7DFB
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0xD78AC3D4
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x1F86F4C3
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x193B5332
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x4F51B34D
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x0521E7FF
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x185C8C35

0x51EF4E84
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x9A2C8594
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0xF5709931
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x74D66DE4

0x51EF4E84
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x51601514
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xD0CCD687
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0xE7BCCA46
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0xDF22A8CE
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x8561083C
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xCEB15BA2
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0x726E5181
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x3CC00617
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0xA7E3DF88
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x9D8E3290
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0xE4253307

0x51EF4E84
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0xD46F0653
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x14672674
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x9CD619D2
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x59F66340
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x17C2FEAE
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0xA86FECD5
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x83F581CB
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x742E1A2C
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0x7A81052F
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x7E7C5555
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0x8009E943
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x0043C493
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0xB73066A5
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x6CB9F96D
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x0B467F9A
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0xB2B1B2B0
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x82044367
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x734D1501
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x6E209217
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0xC44CF60D
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0x443E8D4F
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0xC69E0AFA
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0xD4282DDC
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0xFBF860B8
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x2D6A6EDA
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0x142555D1
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0xB99DCA98
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0xEFA7E5AD
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xBC3B6B61
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x4CB9809B
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0xD5EF391D
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0xB36FCE6F

0x51EF4E84
She closed her lips.
0x28B727E6

0x51EF4E84
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0xA7466B46
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0xDA7ADAB6
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x95EFBDB6
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0xA0C16517
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x9DBEDA96
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x5D4155F1
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x514E7CDB
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x66FA01B1
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0xB372C039

0x51EF4E84
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0xC88450FA
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0xC0382B68
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0x4414171B
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x49F281B2
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x6E295B8F

0x51EF4E84
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x739F1514
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x63EBA16F
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x72168885
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0xEF42BC49
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x2DFF6207
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x341A7DDD

0x51EF4E84
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x991F1BB1
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0x644F2B4B
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0xA2481654
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x80AED689
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0xBA1A73DE
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x09F2662F
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0xD942D1BB
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x08AE8643
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0xED62CFC9
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x75309CB8

0x51EF4E84
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0xB98DADC1
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x6E15B8BC
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0x49ED7C0C
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x0C70E000

0x51EF4E84
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0xD1959B0D
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xD683A188
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0xCB284DD1
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x1C6F54C8
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x695531A0
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0xA9E11082
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x93FD3C7C

0x51EF4E84
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0xFB4A9583
her.
0x69231CC3

0x51EF4E84
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x5087FE7C

0x51EF4E84
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0xB5782AC2
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x91E3F086
me--where is Bessie?"
0xD14B144F

0x51EF4E84
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x95062D90

0x51EF4E84
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0x34F76CBA
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x3B0790F5
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0xB738A169

0x51EF4E84
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xB876E068
identity.
0x07C288E8

0x51EF4E84
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x2F0730B2
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0xF4E7BF94
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x1BCEE7B2
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x922EBA5B
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0xBECA4F78
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xD2463416

0x51EF4E84
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x4B38F135
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xA1406377
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x5E2542F7
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0xC2889E84
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0xAE04C9A5

0x51EF4E84
I assured her we were alone.
0x964B11C7

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xA3A3A27D
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x0EF53EBB
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0xC7A0433D
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x19F7F03A
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x79EDB550

0x51EF4E84
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0x6B3D6024
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x03BC2FE4
of the last pang.
0x0B632FD0

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x3AE52616
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x19709DA5
there."
0x62E72D52

0x51EF4E84
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0xE07EEE48

0x51EF4E84
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xF0278E9A

0x51EF4E84
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0xB16624E2
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0xD5B89647
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0x4B05283B
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x4C2826C2
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x57D87316
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0xF088EDF3

0x51EF4E84
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0xF29EA434

0x51EF4E84
It was dated three years back.
0x70797B2B

0x51EF4E84
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0xB9CECA1A

0x51EF4E84
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x56A4AAAF
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x4D5BD9DA
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x33D238C8
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x87C4228D
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0xE5640787
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0xB9198FFA
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0xB237082C
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0xE6BEDDEC
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0x393B1D7B
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0xC3ED4534

0x51EF4E84
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0x7DF2DEEB
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x11BB39E1
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0xB736A1DD
passed since that day."
0x99020DEE

0x51EF4E84
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0x2C1037B9
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x6BC2F70D

0x51EF4E84
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x78C75DCA
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x980C5C93
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x03CD02E5
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x54C4B88A
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x1BE64BAC
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0xF705AE72
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0x00C1570C
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x9C2AEE62

0x51EF4E84
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0x8AF1C6DA
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0xF6E7990E

0x51EF4E84
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0x4FDD4526
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0x6E75DDCF
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x404A75ED
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x8769CFCC

0x51EF4E84
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0xFA97F31D
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x37305F32
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0x368BE585
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x70563451

0x51EF4E84
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x242623B8
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0xB491BAE7
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x35E39376
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x0DEA0221
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x0758D309

0x51EF4E84
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0xF5E111BA
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x857D3B37

0x51EF4E84
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x62403C8A
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0xE289DD7E
she must hate me still.
0xF61CCA43

0x51EF4E84
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x59ED3303
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xA5210ACF
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0x630287FE
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x16072232
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0xA7CEDC38
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0x126D5C40
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0xC11615E1
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xEC21B728
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0x3120EF7E
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x931D8C1E
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0x8C649486
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x208D7E94
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x6BD37006
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x4D23D281
form.
0x22611C32

0x51EF4E84
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x9815E649
observed--
0xA8ABFB8D

0x51EF4E84
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x206C25A1
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0xA49ECFB5
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x6DFB2718
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXII
0x8985CA4F

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0xA94C37AD
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x0180DF8E
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x64E73890
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0xDDBA32A5
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x45E5546D
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x7143C4FC
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x814FC2ED
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0xF5A45BCD
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x10E3BD6A
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x2B20F7F3
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x1466ECEE
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x5D602EEC
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0xD3D2803F
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x6539A8AD
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x1B7FE547
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0xED348DC7
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xD281B904
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x248F6FC1
patient and compliant on my part."
0xF9815CD2

0x51EF4E84
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x3C2E458A
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0xFD56481E
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0xEEB08404
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x77F9D502
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0xA0859776
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0xFA54AEAB
notes of condolence.
0x08F91832

0x51EF4E84
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xE95227F8
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0xDA09F142
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xD9D5BF59
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0xA51EF123
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x81E9C0B8
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0xBCA008CB
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x1FAD8B39
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x480AD9AC
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x84B0324D
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xB0B6E6FD
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0xAA935326
veil."
0x7263BD7B

0x51EF4E84
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0xB594CE15
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x05C18DFE
good may it do you!"
0xE89B52DA

0x51EF4E84
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x7FD80F4F
you have some sense."
0x1E3855D5

0x51EF4E84
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0xF3580C22
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0xBE60140A
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xDB6040A0
much care."
0xCB9D2EF4

0x51EF4E84
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0xABD3B4D3
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0xDB7B8D1D
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0x432F9C63
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x239C4A48
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x15805266
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0xD2BF24E8
fortune.
0x7654B96E

0x51EF4E84
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x524E0404
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0xD7C39FF2
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0xF7BF912C
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0xD6912893
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0x7CDFD44F
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0xBA263AE8
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0xB6BB39C9
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0xF32DF86C
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0x6622660D

0x51EF4E84
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0x8A76617F
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x7F5DDF61
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0xEC31702F
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0xE958949A
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x41030CD8
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x8B1AA0B0
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x6973CE67
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x267C2CB7
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x882CEC48
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0xE043CF29
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xDDFF0CB7
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0xD2156B8A

0x51EF4E84
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0x9BCF086B
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x13B73B45
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0xDF770531
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0xFA80A9CC
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0xB33E1CAE
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0xD94B30F7
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0x943ECA40
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0xD86BE5A7
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x794BF16D
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x92B07B9E
don't doubt it."
0xF0B35DD3

0x51EF4E84
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x1A1668AF
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xEE0F35AB
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xCA4BCE78
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0x0726B075
both her and me.
0x24025E0A

0x51EF4E84
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0x5510E8D7
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x1816AFB4
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0xB8028C5C
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0xC0EE5D78
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x995D9CA7
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x9ED6D9D0

0x51EF4E84
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0x78C6F5C4
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x4E69BBED
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x7E611174
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0xB9434834
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x0779185D
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x94AEE900
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0x84998604

0x51EF4E84
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x3F3BB195
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0xB738F983
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x1ABC4135
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0x68996215
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0x34C6BCBA
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x42D7E87F
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x01F0ED28

0x51EF4E84
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x86A1AB92
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0xB456F9B4
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xB9A2844E
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x5E103D22
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0x17FAE4C2
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x3BB52CD4
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xCD513780

0x51EF4E84
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0xA8AD415C
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0xD3A75505
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x22FC359D
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0xD036DD4F
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x5BBD87AF
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xE14C76AA
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x876BD434
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x32FE7326

0x51EF4E84
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0xFDC00F7F
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x92FFEB31
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x345B3FE6
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0x97E8D0C8
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0x25198099
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0xF9DEBB49

0x51EF4E84
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x3A40FA75
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xBA948EC5

0x51EF4E84
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x20F0132D
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x24D08A10
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0xE56E5235
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x14C6153B
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x7F4043BC
behave with decent composure.
0xD8A73D96

0x51EF4E84
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0xBACE0A0F
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x017A2A5F
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x5EEEBB90
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0xD31391CB
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0xD49048C2
month?"
0xEAA83BB1

0x51EF4E84
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0xDA9779D8

0x51EF4E84
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0x403B5A7D
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0x08B45779
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x2957AB61
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x2EFBE372
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0xCA8492B3
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x69D45710
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x1E709538

0x51EF4E84
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x18A9A908
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x1C334E73
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x07BD7372
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x9869E307
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x5FCFE2A6
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x28D099D7
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xEE4A20CC
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0xD679C520
that it were my home!
0x09CE5124

0x51EF4E84
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x3E590BF3
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xACAA2A28

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0x75004C46

0x51EF4E84
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0xFB800518

0x51EF4E84
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xAA7A6103

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x7429B2AD

0x51EF4E84
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0xBE21AE47
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x579BB8C2
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x3482DDE4
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xAC287051
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0xDF2E6581
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x52510EEE

0x51EF4E84
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x65735D1F
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x8D58CD29
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0xC171D6E7

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x13AAECE2
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0xF0104AB8
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x2100B8FD
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x9B72AAF0
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0x9ED741EF
shed it over me now.
0xA5F75FF5

0x51EF4E84
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0xB11684BC
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x49B582B7

0x51EF4E84
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0xCE8720AD
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0xC9E231F8
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x04FAAC66
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xA7E4BD6F

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0xA9A67BA3
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0xD58E9588

0x51EF4E84
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x924C01B0
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0xD04FDF9E
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x1B519563
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x62CD6843
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xEE73505E
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x14373579

0x51EF4E84
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x6B7ACEC6
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0xEC337CA2
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x618C821C
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xF5576DCF
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0xBC599442
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0xF2920A3C
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x4679B407
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0xB4739B49
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x90A58DC4
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x6516794C
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0xADADCEDC
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0xCDDEC69F
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x8918BDB5
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x344CC07C

0x51EF4E84
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x918343B5
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x20BF15A8
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xF6D6E32B
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x586EBFF0
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x30D21198
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0x17C891EF
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xC999C239

0x51EF4E84
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0xC4AB0D2D
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0x4E123ED0
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0x7416C1E5
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0x6A03B94D
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x04065703
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0x252CFA48
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x2C4BB06D
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x8C9D68C8
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0xE270C34A
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0xD014436C
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0xC4472E40
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0x811E67EB
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.
0x6FDEEC17

CHAPTER XXIII
0x93A73EEA

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x7BFA2696
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x4E66DD7A
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x8AA5C637
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x3E23325D
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x73A1D040
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0xC05A43B5
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x312E619F
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x42A60915

0x51EF4E84
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x8BC46D11
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xEDB93279
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0xAEE2EFB1

0x51EF4E84
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x352FA68B
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x7B5B6242
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x21072B40
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x6D1FBC7D
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0x006C58B5
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x3AAE5711
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0x637A6F41
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xB9103559

0x51EF4E84
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x833726F2
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0xC5C4E3B8
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0xD1F5DB97
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x9357031C
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x78FBB9ED
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0xAEAE1011
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x94047B30
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0xCCB0558D
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0xFDDAC9F0
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0xDEC2B332
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x852DEEFA
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x4377A1AB
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xB3C37364
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0xE99FC48A
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0xA9BCFA50

0x51EF4E84
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x4F6E156E
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x4704BCB0
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0xBB387D84
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x8D429FDB
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x9DC16AB6
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0xF017D96C
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0xDC07AAE0
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x2DA1C331
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x7CA57892

0x51EF4E84
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x23E1F204
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xF7DFBCDD
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0xEC76DFC6
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xA33FB327
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0x7C7DCF71
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0xA23D2A0A
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0x0B1DBDF4

0x51EF4E84
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0xC36AA4F5
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x6668E511

0x51EF4E84
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xA86713BF
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xF33E6BE3
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0xC5EE8DC8
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0x975ED9A3
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x99408EF6
turning--
0x9AB82D15

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x2086D05E

0x51EF4E84
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x165BEBCA
started at first, and then I approached him.
0xF75C70D3

0x51EF4E84
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x598D3D88
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xC6E318D5
there! he is flown."
0xC341C51D

0x51EF4E84
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0xA5BF1D97
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x34D171D5

0x51EF4E84
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0xA25EA931
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x7BA87B9B
moonrise."
0xFD31339D

0x51EF4E84
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0x2C6CE253
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0xB5A222B7
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x915EC016
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x90A9428B
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0xD17F2701
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0xC227B814
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x637236AE
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x10EA7C57
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x5B83B221
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x537AF53C
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x63B92D62

0x51EF4E84
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x52E29150
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x7405B98A
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x56FE064B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0x1163FFCB
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0x2B9CC3D4
Adhesiveness?"
0xEFEAA691

0x51EF4E84
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x9D8AD600

0x51EF4E84
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x6ACD8F39
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0xD09DC5BC
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x32FA423B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x5683D5F1

0x51EF4E84
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0xFB7771E0

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0x0F2D9DCF
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x73C8CEE9
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0xD9425FEC
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x9F61DE84

0x51EF4E84
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0xDB821B8B

0x51EF4E84
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0xBC06D2F6
must."
0x9E176699

0x51EF4E84
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0x91232BD1

0x51EF4E84
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0x76E01B5B

0x51EF4E84
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0xB2C344CE

0x51EF4E84
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0x30F81EA4

0x51EF4E84
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0x1C342D54
straight on the head."
0xEF3A3E6D

0x51EF4E84
"Soon, sir?"
0xA64E76F8

0x51EF4E84
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x4FB3B118
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xC41796B7
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0xB144648B
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x176F7438
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0x10EDE96C
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x535D2C2D
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x3F772359
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x668BCEE6
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x07070D05
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x08A70066
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xCC8343B2
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0xBD5572DB
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0xC9F916F7
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0xA47B370F
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0xF65C4960
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x6EC8C311
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x0AC38AE4

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0x67140694
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x0DE221DE
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0xC76CDBB7
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0xB524D43E

0x51EF4E84
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xB7D650B7
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x61D89843
for you."
0x2DBC594B

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0x452246AC

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0xA215F354
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x831A4C31
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0xE0B880AB
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x116E4A7E
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x18CE9C5A
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0x5A242379
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x3902A2C9

0x51EF4E84
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x6F67147A

0x51EF4E84
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0x2EEFA75E
distance."
0x8A28FC15

0x51EF4E84
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x9C629BE3

0x51EF4E84
"From what, Jane?"
0x1B25ECE1

0x51EF4E84
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0xE1A30F0C

0x51EF4E84
"Well?"
0x2FADD6BF

0x51EF4E84
"From _you_, sir."
0xB0DE809F

0x51EF4E84
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0xFE7A1459
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0x92F98E78
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x6531109E
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0xBCC30EE9
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x21F61317
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0x14321A01
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xE13FD95B
loved.
0xF32D59F7

0x51EF4E84
"It is a long way," I again said.
0x9497003E

0x51EF4E84
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x1973A2A8
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x9F54CF88
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0xE291D5C8
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x05ED17A8

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xC287EB5C
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0xEDB656C7
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x696C7D24
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0xEC112058
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0xCAE5B6C4
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x6EFACDC7
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x6DF8E54A

0x51EF4E84
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x5F56832A
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x7D8B0E2A
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0xA4DB3B4F

0x51EF4E84
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x74262856

0x51EF4E84
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x7A97386F
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x084F58F8
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xB3AF8461
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x70DC0C6E
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0x53E1C262
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x9C642177
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x9C5AECF1
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x3697659F

0x51EF4E84
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x8BB05449

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x520B8F86

0x51EF4E84
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x19CC4F6A
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x1EFE8BB4
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x1A1FC094
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xC91D76BD

0x51EF4E84
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0x86240C14

0x51EF4E84
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x2B8E9FDC
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x0825FC7A
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x3621600C
speak.
0x9EEAAF0B

0x51EF4E84
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x6EC7467C
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x4C7E4A90
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x76DE91E9
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0xDDFCDE8C
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xA40F8290
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0xE83B6E75
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x6BDD5917
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0xAB160D2C
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0xD9BC1DDA
on the necessity of death."
0x4C8F5B6B

0x51EF4E84
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x4B276CAB

0x51EF4E84
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0x56B30B89

0x51EF4E84
"In what shape?"
0xA05D3D59

0x51EF4E84
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x1BE5CCE5

0x51EF4E84
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0xFAA16DBA

0x51EF4E84
"But you will have."
0xAD7523CC

0x51EF4E84
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x41BB087D

0x51EF4E84
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x9ABFAC4B

0x51EF4E84
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0x07EB0FD8

0x51EF4E84
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x8FEE9234
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xA7484A7F
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x8B2CA652
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x0D5FF1FB
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0xE695EFFB
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x05CA134C
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x4E43DDBF
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0xAC52DC2C
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x83E553F1
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0xCD7BE3C4
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x9FBAA3B0
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0xA8C150D3

0x51EF4E84
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0xA3E8BD17
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0xE72D462E
Jane!"
0xD64D4D94

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0xBF8DB7CC
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0x1AD1D47C
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x899508F6
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x4A17BDF8
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x74949282

0x51EF4E84
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x1B2267EC

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0xE349774A

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0xF69D1939
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x1114D536

0x51EF4E84
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0xDAE84F58
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xDD71378B

0x51EF4E84
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x9DF43BF1

0x51EF4E84
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x6DF87B34
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0x6327FD61

0x51EF4E84
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0xF900ED6E

0x51EF4E84
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x5A691AE8
best earthly companion."
0xEF3CB1A9

0x51EF4E84
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x3AC56309

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0x25CE78BC
too."
0x3509E25E

0x51EF4E84
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x58F3ADCC
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x4B76CB72
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x4DB5452F
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0x15E6ACA9
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x93677A9F
said--
0xA747663A

0x51EF4E84
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0x09240E8E

0x51EF4E84
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0x5EE35FAD
return."
0xCF4C1B26

0x51EF4E84
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x6C4AD085

0x51EF4E84
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0x592A40A5

0x51EF4E84
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0x4FD063D7

0x51EF4E84
"Your bride stands between us."
0x53DC8D5D

0x51EF4E84
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x9F08480E

0x51EF4E84
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0x34305368
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0xB0B1F262

0x51EF4E84
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0xFD5875F6
was still incredulous.
0xC4D08443

0x51EF4E84
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x5DDA4B0E

0x51EF4E84
"Entirely."
0xB3C5C980

0x51EF4E84
"You have no faith in me?"
0xD1C58F13

0x51EF4E84
"Not a whit."
0x1F8F0051

0x51EF4E84
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0xE9978645
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0xCA662EEA
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0xD8E70A5E
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x3ED29644
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x11B14494
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0xEF90B565
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0x50523A01
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x9AAE8EDA
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0xD4F04AFD

0x51EF4E84
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x43B95AD0
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0xF41AB2D4
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x3357C945
given me?"
0x1988C094

0x51EF4E84
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x1292171E
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x58F1FD62

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x18EC7D0A

0x51EF4E84
"Why?"
0x66842582

0x51EF4E84
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0xB5F41BBF

0x51EF4E84
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0xCCA9773A
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x9E7C25B3

0x51EF4E84
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x1422A8D5
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x6F1B03EE

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0xD605A546
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0x551D8330

0x51EF4E84
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0xF5ED67A0
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x7F0F193C

0x51EF4E84
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xC197512A
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x9D9FE5AB

0x51EF4E84
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x44793707
be your wife?"
0x215050EA

0x51EF4E84
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x41D49FC4

0x51EF4E84
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0x9DFF6E6F

0x51EF4E84
"Edward--my little wife!"
0x18B22383

0x51EF4E84
"Dear Edward!"
0x944D2614

0x51EF4E84
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x07E1070B
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0xEBB81E70
happiness--I will make yours."
0x8785AA05

0x51EF4E84
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0xA16A0932
have her, and will hold her."
0xD5543CAA

0x51EF4E84
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0x3DF906F1

0x51EF4E84
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xF9128D61
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x88246069
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0xAA99CB59
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x8F7A5300
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x96AB93E2
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0xEE3539F2
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xFCCC3348
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x4A6E5570
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xE7EB6F70
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x0671ECE4
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x67C5B4CA

0x51EF4E84
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x21CEAF4F
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0xCC504A24
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x6D56E12C
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x3D67A5E2

0x51EF4E84
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x67091968
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0xB0C6EDFD

0x51EF4E84
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x62D3C107
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x325AE973
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xB58C39B2
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x8A46FD4E

0x51EF4E84
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0xFA8B7B31
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xC758AEC8
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x8EC9CF49
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x90F1E26D
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x24ADA349
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xC19EDCD4

0x51EF4E84
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x1538AF6F
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x12396B8E

0x51EF4E84
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x0008DB98
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x94ADADFF
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x5D3D8BC9
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x192A7C72
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0xA98F9EAF
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x6F6E5E7C
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0x67C5AAF1
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x98ED3B41
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0xE825DC00
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0xFE1AF46C
strength for anything.
0x6DFC1922

0x51EF4E84
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x9CB06A6E
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0xEBA283FA
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0xDB99D531

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXIV
0x29671486

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x2D7006A7
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xEEFC9823
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x6C36E47D

0x51EF4E84
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0xE41FA64F
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0xE93476D3
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x52634AFB
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xDAD8D782
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x0BC90A99
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0xE89EC92F
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0xDBEA4B87
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x9E4A365C
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0x716AB1DC

0x51EF4E84
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0xAA58DA8F
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x63927B94
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0xBB406103
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x96759618
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x965EE21B
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xA779C9A0
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x22C6D7A9
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0x68978C60
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0xC3246488

0x51EF4E84
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x6CC1F083
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x7E14D40B
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0x959F14B7
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x18BC4167
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x476D30B4
schoolroom.
0xE4841494

0x51EF4E84
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x5F5E5C6D

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x3C2391E2

0x51EF4E84
"Where is he?"
0xE21C67F0

0x51EF4E84
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x860A7737
there he stood.
0xB470B756

0x51EF4E84
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0x384800B4
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x9C59CAAC
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x7A6C08D3
well loved, so caressed by him.
0xF0B23407

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x2D21030A
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x0687BE6A
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x5082C21E
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xA9ACA0BE
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x08C3D18A
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0xCA2D1325

0x51EF4E84
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x76E01638

0x51EF4E84
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x92D10641
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x5DE59ECD

0x51EF4E84
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0xF84B874C
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0xD0580EF0
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0x5FC0CA92
think almost fear.
0x52FAB44D

0x51EF4E84
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0xDB9D1F16

0x51EF4E84
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x8D7DA932
strange."
0x181A98D5

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x42DEBF8E
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xFC8051FF

0x51EF4E84
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0x8D568D75
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0xF233B070
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x21631960
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x4C1849FB

0x51EF4E84
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0x786C76E6
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0xD7CB94C0
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0x81016DD3
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x4E9662AC
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0xD6F9AA99

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x3FBA0285
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x6FB4F578
have them."
0x269BDF58

0x51EF4E84
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0xC2472655
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0xA648EA80
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0x7759803B
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0x660C7BCC

0x51EF4E84
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0xBFAEE50E
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0xB123C158
Quakerish governess."
0xB663EB63

0x51EF4E84
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xF0E15BFC
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0xAC955BA8

0x51EF4E84
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0xD7EC5DC6
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0x0620B2D4

0x51EF4E84
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0x0493AFE2
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0xE19CEB13
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0x95CF6F13
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x2E8C0E40
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0x7144C0F2

0x51EF4E84
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x468A7B70
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x494BBBD5
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x688FE5C1
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x8F27E77F
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0xE8512003
flatter me."
0x49EF2E10

0x51EF4E84
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x5530D959
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0xA1F8AF7A
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x24888B67
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x99DD0C7C
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0x38E83696
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0x10BDB392
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x5C79ED2E
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0xC1C13EAE
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x589E0288

0x51EF4E84
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x7F3B57F6

0x51EF4E84
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0x5AD56D6E
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x0F183995
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0xCA9A7154
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0xAFDD8B28
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x35FD5DCD
as my comforter."
0x0A0C0B4C

0x51EF4E84
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xAF9C0414
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0x4D1FA3A0
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x66E58A4F
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0xC12E4CBF
anticipate."
0xFDDBAA64

0x51EF4E84
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x3066CF94

0x51EF4E84
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0xCC1CF87A
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x3D955B4D
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x1422D388
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x8027EC9F
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0xC14AA817
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x9618D25D
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x3842A497
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0xB8446770
dear master."
0xD35C5C92

0x51EF4E84
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x7124A732
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x6BBE3491
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0x0D3889C2

0x51EF4E84
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0xAD668D64

0x51EF4E84
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x6566B4D1
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0x6615B6B2
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0xCDB9950B
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x29B08560
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0xB888F4E8
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x3AB87C80

0x51EF4E84
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0x5BCBDD50
such an one?"
0x50C0887F

0x51EF4E84
"I love it now."
0x75102696

0x51EF4E84
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0xAAED1CFC
standard?"
0x2DD49526

0x51EF4E84
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0xAAD2C435
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0xCF82EF03
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x687680DB
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0xD718A84A
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x10F10A27
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x52C5D766
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0xC463E951

0x51EF4E84
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0xDF86C9E0
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x8AC799FA

0x51EF4E84
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xCE6C62EC

0x51EF4E84
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0x1C864486
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0x49D74B37
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x82D932F7
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x5C77F3DD
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x6866455F
pleasure to grant."
0xBB02B7FD

0x51EF4E84
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x8BB978D2

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0x9CEB7A8E

0x51EF4E84
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x4E45D099
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0x041F43E2

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x89974339
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x55606397
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x84D231CE

0x51EF4E84
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0x0275FA8F
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x2A016B58
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0x9F9D4609
withdrawn: try again."
0xCCAF5DF5

0x51EF4E84
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0xAB4B1489
piqued on one point."
0xAEFD9B42

0x51EF4E84
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0xCDC10452
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0xBA64ED44
request--"
0x209D78E4

0x51EF4E84
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0x902D88CF

0x51EF4E84
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0xB7159281
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x7CAD2082

0x51EF4E84
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0x86E34AF8
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x167E2707
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0x3C79618E
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0xE1FA1614

0x51EF4E84
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x018AA4D3
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0x0500EAAC
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x955353BF

0x51EF4E84
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0xAEA098D0
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0x923A6305
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x1FAE7A34
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0x870A86B9
of my power?"
0xEEACAC37

0x51EF4E84
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0xEA66F94D
up."
0xECA8B4B0

0x51EF4E84
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0x67E3D919
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0xCA8E3D09
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0x99DC94D7
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x3AB03D4F

0x51EF4E84
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x1AC6DD04
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x1CB496C2
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x5AA38735

0x51EF4E84
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xCEDEB1F2
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0xD1D1EAAD
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xB1B98A7D
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x71F97CE5

0x51EF4E84
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x096AEE87
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0xA57B52DE
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x95670938
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0xB2F8EF79
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x29FAF6E4
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x7E9E9226
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0xCA268462
made me the offer."
0x1FDF357A

0x51EF4E84
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0xDA534140

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0xA5CB1614
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x7D8B1149
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0x65413393

0x51EF4E84
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x3B734F4A
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x869BCA05
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0xD2A9FAEB

0x51EF4E84
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xA4034E01
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x4A637D14

0x51EF4E84
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0xA76A9739
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x696FF6D7
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x4DCB39AE
deserted?"
0x52515A33

0x51EF4E84
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x5BF5850C
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0xFAA06A83
moment."
0x556E7CA4

0x51EF4E84
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0x340FDF77
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x315B9D07

0x51EF4E84
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0x1198FF1A
awry for want of attention."
0x20ED976C

0x51EF4E84
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0xCEBC6605
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x2153FAEB
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x9F21B58E

0x51EF4E84
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x50BD9022
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x36DE7F35
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0x453C0D64

0x51EF4E84
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x98F295F7
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x919CC781
express.
0x509485C0

0x51EF4E84
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0xF48D9294
entreated, and to yield."
0x39E7B0B1

0x51EF4E84
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0x5FCCCDB7
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0xF2AA8A19
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x583C75A1
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0xF40DD0D4

0x51EF4E84
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0xE058176B
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x12486C27
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x9F0D9BEB
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x99AE9FF3

0x51EF4E84
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0x4B218AF9

0x51EF4E84
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x9A418099
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xD75E9780

0x51EF4E84
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x33A15C22
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0x3204D4D6
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x4C49D6D8
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0xED935776
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x955B2535
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x32E2AE84
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x0F82F554
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x56366F6B
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x793438C2
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0x270A7386

0x51EF4E84
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0xAA781CC6
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x883E1F26
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0xC7D490A0
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0xBD67E2BA
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x521AE98B
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0x604B74CF
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xC2BF2301
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x81C316A1
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x53ED0466
you would be his wife."
0x2C5CE911

0x51EF4E84
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0xDF9DBC39

0x51EF4E84
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0x98D6327C

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x0F9B34C2
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0xD7CEAE4B
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x597BD0A9

0x51EF4E84
"He tells me so."
0xC746AEFE

0x51EF4E84
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x95DBD63C
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x971AAFFA

0x51EF4E84
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x1529251F
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x622E645B
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0xE6E4BB09
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x7F85B2D8
father."
0x878F088E

0x51EF4E84
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x1F85C622
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0xA8392CAD
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x8B10375D
twenty."
0xA5FB7811

0x51EF4E84
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0xBCE3FFBD

0x51EF4E84
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0xA034B711
eyes.
0x53589981

0x51EF4E84
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x5EFE7F07
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x02C32712
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x2A238668
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0xB2493983
I expect."
0x05F0DDFB

0x51EF4E84
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0xC3A6CCBF
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x8024B9D2

0x51EF4E84
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0xB5B5C63C
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0xF260A580
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xB2013330
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x3DB19571
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x5635806B
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x47DABA05
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x4AD633D1
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x4F45F620
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x53F28026
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0xA474E982
him."
0x5144B561

0x51EF4E84
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x06006B4F
that all was right."
0x319D88FE

0x51EF4E84
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xA3A99FDD
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x40E46C2D
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xC7D2A92D
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0xD6078A0F

0x51EF4E84
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0xAE5B4E5C

0x51EF4E84
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x564890B3
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xFACD2268
me go mademoiselle."
0x500DF1E3

0x51EF4E84
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x32FC7405
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x2E32FED3
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0xB80E83F6
backwards and forwards.
0x18DC8607

0x51EF4E84
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x17B9EE4D

0x51EF4E84
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0x1724CF69

0x51EF4E84
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x410DA7BB

0x51EF4E84
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x55E9D9D7

0x51EF4E84
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x86F0974C
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x52DD9B11
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x5F9E5457
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x87085DFA
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x0A8DCD1E
my face.
0xAB39A1A1

0x51EF4E84
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0xFCF6C6DA
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0x72B08B50

0x51EF4E84
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x652D9918

0x51EF4E84
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x71B1B56F
to Adele.
0x8531D0DB

0x51EF4E84
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0xBDFCA932

0x51EF4E84
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0xFF362B3B
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0xF3EF701D
company--for life."
0xF5AC66A2

0x51EF4E84
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0x62E81B8B
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0xBB0D26CE
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x0D38D46D
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x5477A124
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x79044531

0x51EF4E84
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x1841ABB2
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x71C3B3B8

0x51EF4E84
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0xB28CEE8B
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0x42902300

0x51EF4E84
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x0948D0AB
mademoiselle?"
0x72A462E8

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xE94F9738
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x228CBD93
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x088D1328
there, and only me."
0x5B4DDCD6

0x51EF4E84
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xB0ECCEC4

0x51EF4E84
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x0F457E48
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x8D74910F

0x51EF4E84
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0x2A56585F

0x51EF4E84
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0xA4DB754A
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0x0613E55E

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x03B9A0D6
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0x7158D0ED

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x5D971428
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x275E376D
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x8DF3E639
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0xB6FE8E79

0x51EF4E84
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0x208141FE
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0xE5237980
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0xA7EA4D2E

0x51EF4E84
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x9C97D180

0x51EF4E84
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x1EAE4A85
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0x31217C53

0x51EF4E84
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x613CBFA0
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0x1576299F
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0xCAD920E7
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x27AA65C6

0x51EF4E84
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xCBC97006
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0x52DD237B
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x5FC25456
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x96B61443
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0x5412A997
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x80DEA3A4
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x6DC315D5
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0xF98FFC5A
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x9F1E7EBD
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xF4BB8828
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x16929B41
effect--
0xF672E2DB

0x51EF4E84
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0x1A894F5C
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0x3F9E6B4E
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0xD04D27B3
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x03D6D4D6
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0x3053E4B2
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x90B48391

0x51EF4E84
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x4CF398E5
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x66449493
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0xA90A8E55
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xA14A4507
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0xBEE8697F
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x20CAD1CB
again."
0x276C0ED5

0x51EF4E84
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x4F1B8BFD
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x011EDAE6

0x51EF4E84
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0xE8D1F0C1
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x5944D63D
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0xD15E224F
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0xFC84F32B
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x0899D5DC
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x1914670A
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x94F6F601

0x51EF4E84
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x52C74901
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0xCB777B31
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x46555694
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0xE66D1809
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x5486F1C2
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xA50A0ED3
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x5364EDA7
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0xDDF96D35
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x1280C78F
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x869662E7
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x9BFE69E7
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x742161AB
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x9F8A5A73
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xA3A358C0

0x51EF4E84
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xD9DC21F3
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x6070C78D
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0x2FBC0DD5
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xDFA5DE84
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0x80A6F57E
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0x651E1C19
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0x2523C715
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x629EDA35
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0xB75FC262
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x298CF711
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x5BF5BC6E
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x5D46A097
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x6C412EA4
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x204AB9F4
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x74190A00
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0xE646718A
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x84DAB9C2
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x360E71A1
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x841B4A18
passionate pressure.
0x4D3EFDB5

0x51EF4E84
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x97C328DD
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x3E269758
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0xC05BE65B
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x66057EAE
satin."
0x29B5D910

0x51EF4E84
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0xED959F76
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0xCBBC2E75
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0xA9A49470
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0xB16BBD09

0x51EF4E84
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0xBECCCA49
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x0DDBB4D9
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x255A6E50
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0xEFBB0411
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0xA66B6B86
satisfactorily here."
0x6F7F756C

0x51EF4E84
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xFCEB09B0
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x9AC7C897

0x51EF4E84
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0xF1EB7027
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0x76075D35
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0xE71DE3FB
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0xED308BC3
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x70AD17FF
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x0ACFA817

0x51EF4E84
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0x9A67CC11

0x51EF4E84
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0xC2527ECF
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x3B69EE76
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0x501F7178
would be to violate its conditions."
0xB5F344DA

0x51EF4E84
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x693E24C2
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0xD60A953B
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0xABEAB2EC

0x51EF4E84
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0x7B370C0F
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x8CD082F9
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0x69EDFE75
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0xDBEFC38C
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0xBC178BE5
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0x2BC76B25

0x51EF4E84
"Well, but what?"
0xB0C68651

0x51EF4E84
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0xFAFB3EE2

0x51EF4E84
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x708CDCDE
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0xEB503B79
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0xE9768FC1

0x51EF4E84
"No, thank you, sir."
0x5E8EBA7F

0x51EF4E84
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0x927D61AC

0x51EF4E84
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0x82FF68B2
till--"
0x2C701EAC

0x51EF4E84
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0xA9E9DCB3

0x51EF4E84
"Till I can't help it."
0xEB149686

0x51EF4E84
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0xC4F2E22E
companion of my repast?"
0xB1DB200B

0x51EF4E84
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0xDA9786FC
usual for another month."
0xEAA75B98

0x51EF4E84
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0x141F1725

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0x366ABA11
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0xB1182027
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0xD76B49FE
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0x994EA485

0x51EF4E84
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x111AEA78
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0xCBEF1D02
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0x163DCDB6
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0xF4C2B3DF
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x117DEB58
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x7B19EBA8
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x9EF02D5D
my jewel I should tyne."
0xAC0BE8CC

0x51EF4E84
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x71285EFC
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x073FAEB5
retreat upstairs.
0xF7490391

0x51EF4E84
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0xE5BBA23B
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0x0D169432
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x00DE5C90
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0xC0C125F5
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x89C33979
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x3E5B38F0
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0xF47E3FDF
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x6B5CCF4A
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0xB7842643
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x5942D58D
the present.
0x40265C9D

0x51EF4E84
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x732324FA

0x51EF4E84
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x89BE74AC
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0xA3E1D66D
stimulate it.
0x8AFDDF48

0x51EF4E84
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x24D1249A

0x51EF4E84
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0xEEFD8A77

0x51EF4E84
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x64853B8F
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0x8EB0D8E0
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0xC1711003
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x663C14F4
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0xEA9DA82B
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x63D7CFB8
strain:--
0x65C2A582

0x51EF4E84
   "The truest love that ever heart
0xED83F17F
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x80DF5878
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0x308E1BBD
      The tide of being pour.
0xB9BC16DC

0x51EF4E84
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x5504E4FD
      Her parting was my pain;
0x8F7F4B17
   The chance that did her steps delay
0xD9F351DD
      Was ice in every vein.
0x76966C8D

0x51EF4E84
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x2F733D97
      As I loved, loved to be;
0x57B687A8
   And to this object did I press
0x9557712D
      As blind as eagerly.
0xF6A04F6B

0x51EF4E84
   But wide as pathless was the space
0x2964D894
      That lay our lives between,
0x6175AF07
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0x3B650C46
      Of ocean-surges green.
0x309FBE66

0x51EF4E84
   And haunted as a robber-path
0xBE3180BA
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x57C67F84
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0xCE303B87
      Between our spirits stood.
0x7EB5D797

0x51EF4E84
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0xFE4F1A6C
      I omens did defy:
0x9364E28B
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x81919257
      I passed impetuous by.
0xBB8240B7

0x51EF4E84
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0xABC6F79A
      I flew as in a dream;
0x3DB0CC7D
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0x12AA9EDC
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x270814D5

0x51EF4E84
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0x7565E666
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x1C44D262
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xB8267CDF
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x494FB5E8

0x51EF4E84
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x8BC70FFE
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x68B15934
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0xE4F3E938
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0x49B90902

0x51EF4E84
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x98F49790
      Right, bar approach to me,
0x68B98189
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x3EC5D10D
      Swear endless enmity.
0xF9863C3B

0x51EF4E84
   My love has placed her little hand
0xB6972A76
      With noble faith in mine,
0x3396298E
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x6A3BCAE6
      Our nature shall entwine.
0xFE1D7102

0x51EF4E84
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x76350BF6
      With me to live--to die;
0x43789D30
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0x6A3776FA
      As I love--loved am I!"
0xCC3262BB

0x51EF4E84
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xF82A4F3C
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x2760A7A9
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0xCBC5EA36
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0xBB5E1C58
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x3511CDD6
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xB141CB7B

0x51EF4E84
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x52B9091A

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x9EEEA5A9
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0x22CF678C
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0x6504C866

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x942A7008
Death was not for such as I."
0x74821A04

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x46D7ECC1
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x8CAFA373

0x51EF4E84
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0xF3B30659
reconciling kiss?"
0x410887E3

0x51EF4E84
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x146FCED4

0x51EF4E84
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x191E6A14
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x214E0029
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x6CCD594E

0x51EF4E84
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x2D8D55B8
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x1172F4A4
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0xBABE647E
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0x6F9A7775
time to rescind it.
0xBD5B2ECD

0x51EF4E84
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x4AE34B69

0x51EF4E84
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x9FEBBD64
myself I was doing that now."
0x1B31F495

0x51EF4E84
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x2C8F4AED
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0xD41F8D96
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x548848E8
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0x6B528543
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x4F4A1A34
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x62202C3D
advantage."
0xC0257020

0x51EF4E84
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0x765FA492
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x02C95BB4
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x0AC4C0AD
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0xE8873A3A

0x51EF4E84
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0x4E413C27
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0x7D504F05
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x018078C3
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x85923987
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0xF50F4F2C
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x53FF94A1

0x51EF4E84
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0x329FB23D
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0xF680C2F0
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0xCD3E464B
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x72BC21DD
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0xAB9C5214
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x41F3031B
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0xCDAA9051
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0xEB942D28
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x1C13E393
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xA9DCC3BD
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x8CC23E96
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0x82AB3F9D
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x70B73BF4
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0xE29F6FD3
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x321203F1
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0xD5947199
virtue, another must be devised."
0x963A019B

0x51EF4E84
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xE0197F0C
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x3C47DEEA
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0xA72D264B
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0xDC83EB59
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0xE6AF0497
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x4120771D

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x341C23E7
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0xA759C51D
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x31288F74
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0xEF011327
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xFEF73C0E
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0xC4AD1FE6
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0x70D54F5F
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x0F29B231
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x64FBCC40
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x24D0ED25
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0xB0BCEC09
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0xC2C3E599
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x164DF1F9
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x993F1777
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x14DD2E6F
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xCD23ECFE
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x4831898F
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x75656246
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x643D124F
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x804B4D85
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x57ADEE8B
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0xA6B0FF73
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0xE28D8F88

0x51EF4E84
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0xA237E881
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x92E11E67
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0xD597DB82
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0xD116DFE8
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0xE051D115
more than they.
0xD80E25BE

0x51EF4E84
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x744B0776
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0xB2FFD831
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x4F3A550C
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0x1B7BB261
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0xF0D3092C
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x3C37FE98
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0xD8417073
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0xB457C17A
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0x67070BB0
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0x0DF3954C

0x51EF4E84
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xC7127724
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x6776DD9A
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x66B815A4
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x77F090A9
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xA98C0D6C
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0xCFE459EA
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0xC7F2390E
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0xFAC63C42

0x51EF4E84
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0xCCF7F3CC
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0xA303EA2F
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0xAA43D8CA
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0xE492CE90
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x38FEE389
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0x9E90DC04
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x5842AABD
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0xBA130024
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0xF1623AF1
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x68845129

0x51EF4E84
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x4A37A454
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0xAA1E84F8
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x501FC1AF
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x1A683283
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x2C5515B4
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0xB18EC0D8
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x778DE929
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x628F94CB
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0xBE6140C2
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0x75AB5657
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0xCDB4D04B
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x6DB74FEC
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x057712B6
listen to, and I ran off again.
0xAF89241D

0x51EF4E84
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x9CF297F0
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0xA0D8E94B
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x3E780D99
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0x46F7CB0F
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0x34EE6410
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0xAFF33982
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x1C720E5F
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0xA8F57BA5
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0x4DA72EBD
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0xA13FC77E
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0xCDBB9E68
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x3CE1F56A
simultaneously struck ten.
0x9424AC2B

0x51EF4E84
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0xA02F4498
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x3FCBFCA7
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x6E9F7432

0x51EF4E84
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0xF1167919
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xFE11C8C8
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0xB099B778
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0xCBD1C358
by one moving speck.
0xAE75F036

0x51EF4E84
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0xA09F93A3
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xC3475EE3
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x9485F4EB
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x1DEB8D00

0x51EF4E84
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x133DFE83
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0x97E2C073
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x7EC17FC2
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0xE49E6F6A
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0xA64ED653
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0x34A44E82
meridian, and must now decline.
0xCB7B0144

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x0D42A92D
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0xEC643EFD
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xA3BFC057

0x51EF4E84
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0xA188BC81
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0x2E3474E0
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0x30046BF4
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x8F7D7D57
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x79B8BCA7
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0xA4C74706

0x51EF4E84
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xE020D780
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0xE5F30C83
give me both hands: mount!"
0xB24EC7DB

0x51EF4E84
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x010979B0
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x58884E97
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x2047A7B8
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x8101FA0B
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0xCD30C419

0x51EF4E84
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xEC33E5E5
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0xA03AE3B1

0x51EF4E84
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0xBFF73B00
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x519A7432
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x33FC43E8

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xBB0C1E42

0x51EF4E84
"Then you have been both?"
0x4885B8F2

0x51EF4E84
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0xD5782CD3
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x1A6DF3C7

0x51EF4E84
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0xDFB56ABC
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0x9B1B1939
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x0C1F3444
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xA7B3099C
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0x0DCD3078
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x0576CAA3

0x51EF4E84
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xA0E04753
get down."
0x39145A0A

0x51EF4E84
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x6A01EE73
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0xDAF4900F
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0x4AF19DE5
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x42C47137
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x685EEA20

0x51EF4E84
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x5D833CC3
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x469DB463

0x51EF4E84
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0x80DED0FF
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xCCB7C8B8
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xEE2208FD

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0xA0B48756
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0xBA3FF699

0x51EF4E84
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0xC94D77F5

0x51EF4E84
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0xFC0B3C1F

0x51EF4E84
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0x1194AFD1
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x460CF090
as a long, strong arm.
0x054FBF80

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xEED45F25
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x7881B4AD

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Jane."
0x6493B293

0x51EF4E84
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x0F3E0359
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x34255F90

0x51EF4E84
"It is near midnight," I said.
0xB160E9D3

0x51EF4E84
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0xC3F46B6D
my wedding."
0xF48EC0E5

0x51EF4E84
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xF37488DB
no wish to go to bed."
0xB3BFE571

0x51EF4E84
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0xE7994A95

0x51EF4E84
"All, sir."
0x4F36EA9A

0x51EF4E84
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xFA5681BD
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x211CAC5C
from church."
0xE34BAD5C

0x51EF4E84
"Very well, sir."
0xE83DB039

0x51EF4E84
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0x9A04BE61
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x43DC7D86
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0x823349B5

0x51EF4E84
"I believe I am."
0x075DC3B5

0x51EF4E84
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x605D226D

0x51EF4E84
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0x3D40714C
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0x290EB3F7
charged?"
0xA3BF01C8

0x51EF4E84
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0x154106D8
over-fatigued."
0x874838BB

0x51EF4E84
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xDAB0FCD8

0x51EF4E84
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x4C420AB9

0x51EF4E84
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xCF6B31DA
and flushed.
0xC115DFA9

0x51EF4E84
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0x283024E2
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xA3BB6055
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x51EA87D2

0x51EF4E84
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0xF0572CAA

0x51EF4E84
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x4D6AAE39
new life into which you are passing?"
0x999731F9

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0x0C7CE1F7
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0xEB639D11

0x51EF4E84
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x7B2E45E7

0x51EF4E84
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0x18A40AF9
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xC58B4991
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x6098CD97
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0xE10F93EE
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0x4EF3EECE

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x1AB748E5
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0xD5F5526B
proceeded.
0x92F24E32

0x51EF4E84
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0x75BF4F3B
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x61A0B35B
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0xFD7AF04C
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0x8596B8FF
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x1325CF65
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x2D2BD904
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x35A1ACDC
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x48A9747E
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0xE1F8BAF7
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x7F12EADA
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x32FCD4CA
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x8306294E
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x551E751D
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0x2BD1A73E
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x6C337646
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0xEBAC11C5
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0x851A23D0
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x5803F196
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x0910D8DA
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0xDDEF83AA
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x78E15C15
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0xE45BF35A
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0xA5694228
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0x408E5901
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x00F5816B
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x1A9D29BE
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x9688EEF0
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0xCE1FDF98
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0xE639DF4D
coronet."
0xD3B15538

0x51EF4E84
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xE1CE87B8
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0xE877BF54
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x34862192

0x51EF4E84
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x0B1629D2
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x0E5E262B
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0xBBA2F472
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0xBB9E5BB3
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0xAE3592AD
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0xB2AFEF70
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0xC3C6D1D6
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0x85B35434
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x263973FF
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xD01523E6
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0xA5255A2C
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0x30B5C139
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x1933A0AE
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0xEC5439C4
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x1D1158C4
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0x9D8E8078
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x61568C53
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x2FC3E6BA
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x94CD02FF
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xF0F8C32F
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x9A67545B
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x600E8C0B
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x4B617C96
moment."
0x556E7CA4

0x51EF4E84
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0xAEA12634
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0xC1E5ED4A
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xC2D3CB2B
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0xC32BCCF8
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xA229D45C
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0xE13D9635
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0x994B1BE5
Jane?--repeat it."
0xE13782EE

0x51EF4E84
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0x68F596F8

0x51EF4E84
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0x6EC2D3DE
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0xB5325D99
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xF9F2B280
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x293637B5
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0xFC9DA3FA
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x02976592
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0xBB94FC87
incensed than saddened."
0x5D424E83

0x51EF4E84
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xA7727AB4
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0xD4827CA3

0x51EF4E84
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0xEE36B79B
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x73B89419

0x51EF4E84
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x5D145129
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0xAB2AD129

0x51EF4E84
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x76BAB86C
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0xD02B4539

0x51EF4E84
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x5EFDA68F
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0xCB5A0543
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x4DEC41B2
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x319412E8
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0xCE847BD5
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x4A8D483A
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0xD1D4E4EA
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0xE8536939
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x29E16B38
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xC535EFE7
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0xFAFA6018
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x73817777
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0xEBBCA671
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0x565BED3D
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x0433871D
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x475C401F
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x5CA49BA2
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0x7D8CD9BE
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x8182E68D
woke."
0x18C6FDCC

0x51EF4E84
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x9E55ABDA

0x51EF4E84
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x4F52BF7C
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0x562CAFF2
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x2C1753BC
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x90183BAE
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x53424DAC
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x646AE3BE
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0xFF85D2A8
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x33430551
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x57110FA1
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0xBFE763A8
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x313E6169
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x4085FB35
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0x2754916B

0x51EF4E84
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xBF949556

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x36D1B0E6
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0xF618672A
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0x76F60E5A

0x51EF4E84
"Describe it, Jane."
0x6FAAC351

0x51EF4E84
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0xC6B314BF
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x5D5F6D73
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x89A29986

0x51EF4E84
"Did you see her face?"
0x0DA0F69B

0x51EF4E84
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x35D24F45
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0x4DF9BD83
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x736844DD
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0xA8B44BB6

0x51EF4E84
"And how were they?"
0xB7170955

0x51EF4E84
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0xED446DA2
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0xD9E87FE5
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0xBAF8DF5C

0x51EF4E84
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0xAC8314CF

0x51EF4E84
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x8C19A48F
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0xF82D8049
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0x6F4B05CD

0x51EF4E84
"You may."
0x10E5B274

0x51EF4E84
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0x74EB36F0

0x51EF4E84
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0x46878079

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x3DF22099
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0x8944209C

0x51EF4E84
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x460098A5
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0x10FEA02E

0x51EF4E84
"Afterwards?"
0x02507320

0x51EF4E84
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0x9872D96B
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x44246F2D
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xB609CD0D
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0xEC8EC09E
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xDA25BBEC
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x978C8EF7
from terror."
0xAD5C0D42

0x51EF4E84
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0x448E08B4

0x51EF4E84
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0x3A01C269
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0x0F4D5EF5
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0x28E8DD19
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0xABCD66E1

0x51EF4E84
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x3ECA42A5
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x40606BF3
handling."
0x7C26ABD2

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0x8FF48B42
transaction actually took place."
0x642A395D

0x51EF4E84
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0x49991C95
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x3B11B93C
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x576159A3

0x51EF4E84
"Not yet."
0x8B5230FC

0x51EF4E84
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0xEC4C744F
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xF9476A78
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x5C8179E0

0x51EF4E84
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0xC812D76E
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0xE90ECA31
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x293351C7

0x51EF4E84
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0x2188A1F4

0x51EF4E84
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0x9128DC63
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x24CF8C63
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x13840DDF
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0xB5963524
to bottom in two halves!"
0xCC6E5555

0x51EF4E84
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0x7E8E47A3
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x92B371CF
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x92547048
might have happened!"
0x49D89AF2

0x51EF4E84
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0xF62A8967
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0xFF7BEB1B

0x51EF4E84
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x75BD7871
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0xE903B894
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0x69BBD367
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0xE4F1F10F
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0xEE0C63AF
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x420F0293
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0xA7B1B105
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x340A26BD
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0x1CB56C5B
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0xEB585133
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x9491FC6B
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x40336986
solution of the mystery?"
0xE8FCCDC1

0x51EF4E84
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xE8F8B684
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x0474515D
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0x6700DCB0
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x3A654F55

0x51EF4E84
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x6FC2867E
candle.
0x4D0492E1

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0xAF683BD6
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xDD1AB5C0
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0xD1C8CA14
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0xFB7ED05D

0x51EF4E84
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0xE0E89368

0x51EF4E84
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x8499B4C8
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0x1D803184
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0x9247C93B
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0x6BEA6670
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x6739B2B4
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x81C2F7A5
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x5BA9F2BD

0x51EF4E84
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x658701CA
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x6A63A4C9
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0x5EC67AE0

0x51EF4E84
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x936DECEF
Janet now?"
0xE7F90397

0x51EF4E84
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0xFA9C3786

0x51EF4E84
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xFF76D9E5
love and blissful union."
0xF1A21789

0x51EF4E84
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0x358D3673
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0x8B070B77
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x25A77516
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0xDB37F9C5
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x1B151298
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0xE3776C9E
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0xFED684E2
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x21ABC6EC
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x6BC6109B
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0xF8B3C832
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0xD1B94C11

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0x6EC5DC15
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0xC5857FB7
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0xE5781E6C
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x3309D250
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x9EEF21E6

0x51EF4E84
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0xC7E6AD31
not taken one peep."
0xB8A66669

0x51EF4E84
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x914104F6
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0x9AED04BC
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0x86A02C60
by Mr. Rochester.
0xC383D406

0x51EF4E84
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0xA9702356
so long!"
0x327000C4

0x51EF4E84
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0xE3ADD6FA
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x8D4CDD04
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x11176ADA
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0xE43760A6
footman, answered it.
0x9CEA4A84

0x51EF4E84
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0x53BE6594

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0xCB7CC6F3

0x51EF4E84
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0xB14B94C9

0x51EF4E84
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x3B87D809
there: return and tell me."
0xCE9D9FD7

0x51EF4E84
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xD5548FFD
footman soon returned.
0x313DD8BB

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0xA395B7A3

0x51EF4E84
"And the carriage?"
0x4576C808

0x51EF4E84
"The horses are harnessing."
0x93C3481B

0x51EF4E84
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0x42C0197E
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0xB06A6E52
coachman in his seat."
0x2D2C807E

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, are you ready?"
0xFE5F06FF

0x51EF4E84
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x51148B4D
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x42D38534
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x5DE9169A
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x4361B274
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x4BC29A4C
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0x0B1EBFE2
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x096BF7F8
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x9F840A2D
and flashing eyes.
0xE8DE182A

0x51EF4E84
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x24D9EF01
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xC5152CBF
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x2EC70075
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0xE48786A1
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0xEB2A429A
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x65F38D4C

0x51EF4E84
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x0917905E
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x28932198
me, Jane."
0x1AD34DFA

0x51EF4E84
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xA02E1E1A
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x04172C9D
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x3656E917
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x8498E73D
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x3DF7458F
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0xC60449E9
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x4F0CC187
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0xF6D9099F
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0xC00C146A
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x36785C3A
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x9219E867
path to the porch.
0x071DEF92

0x51EF4E84
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x55BF3A66
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x41BBFA7B
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x53652152
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0xF7C11C5F
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0xDE034B55
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x787AE7E7
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x92309CF9
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x93B2FEAD

0x51EF4E84
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x301A4370
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0x79E4DDE5
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0x6A6FEA0A
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x39FE510A
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0xDFA31549
Rochester, went on.
0xA91AE836

0x51EF4E84
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0xEEC3DC58
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x077838ED
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x9ED86BFD
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0xF34E3422
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x31EA9AC1
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x8CAB1CFB

0x51EF4E84
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0x162337E7
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x3299C190
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x4215C8DB
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x476EC65E
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0x5A9A8AAA
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0xBC0ECCA0

0x51EF4E84
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0x877E8ED1

0x51EF4E84
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0xA78C03D1
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x09FFF5F8
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x741E03A0
said, "Proceed."
0x7B5A6AC2

0x51EF4E84
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x4042BF67
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0x025F74B3

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x44E789C4
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0xB027F06E

0x51EF4E84
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0xDFAB547F
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0xEA3464B8
marriage exists."
0x7F88E283

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0xB06F3E0C
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x568D5AD8
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x9008A857
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0xEEFC0321
beneath!
0x9A298729

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x58C2A2C5
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0xB5E60011

0x51EF4E84
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x93ACE9D8
advisedly."
0x596F97C4

0x51EF4E84
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0xE0933BBC
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x8E82D737

0x51EF4E84
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0xB3F16B21
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x1DE5ABE4

0x51EF4E84
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xF3A14296
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xADBD1008
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0x715FB54A
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x00EB3B30
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0x1D6A5229
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0x1CB32DAE
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0xFEF2BCB3
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0xA856A414

0x51EF4E84
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xB56624D0

0x51EF4E84
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x2C448ADE

0x51EF4E84
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x0FF75ED2

0x51EF4E84
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x58E8AF65
recognises, if you do not."
0xBC5AE26A

0x51EF4E84
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x12BB63BB
place of abode."
0xDD2C6812

0x51EF4E84
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0x4B2DD60B
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0xB5C97984

0x51EF4E84
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xEED7A84D
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0xA4059C7D
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x8F9FE0D5
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0x1424DBDD
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0xCB6FAFF6
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0xACC9A601
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0x60E197C5
Mason.'"
0x3A1616B7

0x51EF4E84
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0xA9443D57
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x4885CADD

0x51EF4E84
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x28675F44

0x51EF4E84
"How do you know?"
0xB3E602EC

0x51EF4E84
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x16D278CC
scarcely controvert."
0x36DC838E

0x51EF4E84
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x1870EC07

0x51EF4E84
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x4A4D0E94
goodness to step forward."
0x7E9A8704

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x8AACA120
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0x1EBC4B69
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x5A7C8717
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x86A99598
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0xAA67ECAD
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0xD90B2205
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0x2682C8DB
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x5381E885
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x40A2DB21
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x966CC0AB
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x663E746C
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0xC5E0DB41
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0xCAE4E607
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xD803B10B

0x51EF4E84
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0x55006028

0x51EF4E84
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x3696ED0B
what have you to say?"
0xF3FE568E

0x51EF4E84
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0xB21DBFB8
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0xDB59003E
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0xDC2D6962

0x51EF4E84
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x18FA944D

0x51EF4E84
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x954B910C
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x5CC736C0

0x51EF4E84
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x04479DED
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0xDA72401A
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x673F7AA6

0x51EF4E84
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x5F431300

0x51EF4E84
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0xBAACC8A5
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0xFE2079E7
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0xB172489D

0x51EF4E84
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xE3894942
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0xCBBF3A2A
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x7AB4B91A
obeyed.
0x75DACE82

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x336593B9
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x7F95C16B
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x0BAB7AF4
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x88F2232A
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xE2252ECD
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x53423F70
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0xF82C4D62
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xC8C55621
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x1E0C46C9
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0xC9A16D03
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0xD96F25D6
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xD6623E18
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0xD3676E6F
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0xC72A036B
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0xBDB42F21
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x1A4AA540
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0xD58408EA
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0xBA707196
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0xEE6FB7C2
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x36A32357
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0x6D79437D
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x9A5E4D99
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0xF734EC15
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x7F5FC8E6
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x8CEC1079
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0x7414D42D
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x10243481
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0xD0425B16
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x6160C16C
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x4D77200E
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x1DF94426
you--follow!"
0xCE0473A0

0x51EF4E84
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x9FC1249B
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x9D0A7DBF

0x51EF4E84
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0xB7ADCE0B
will not be wanted to-day."
0x6A95FDFC

0x51EF4E84
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0x5AC7440D
greet us.
0x3C89827D

0x51EF4E84
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x472BDE37
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0xBDE3A660
late!"
0x592EC28B

0x51EF4E84
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x8639C233
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0xCC6D3C53
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x3A9099C6
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0x9D02E9CB
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0xCFDCDA88

0x51EF4E84
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xCECD8F25
here."
0xC96D05DC

0x51EF4E84
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x312650F8
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0xBA92FE67
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x3B48A8B0
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x95A813D9
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x98620B4E
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0xBA6279F3
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x09D74AE7
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xB0AA72EF
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x482CF0E6
mane, hid its head and face.
0x984CA18D

0x51EF4E84
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x029EFED2
your charge to-day?"
0x288780CC

0x51EF4E84
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x2A65F67A
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x6702AF77

0x51EF4E84
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x09156DEE
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x6E62D71F

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x44DB5719

0x51EF4E84
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0xA07B3F4C

0x51EF4E84
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x1B97C3C9

0x51EF4E84
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x4854E334
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0xC0F9E8BC
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x56A40737

0x51EF4E84
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xF718FAD6
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0xE0C2068F

0x51EF4E84
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x876E40F4
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x13FC6869

0x51EF4E84
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0xDBE5C58A

0x51EF4E84
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x204A7592

0x51EF4E84
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x5DF23DC1
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x10DB87F1
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xD3F2FA2C
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0x42B24498
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x1B3F82ED
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xC017CA8C
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x4442DAC2
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x58FD12B7
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x4C528197
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x7AEF371C
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x8B01D392
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0xC3250D95

0x51EF4E84
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0xE17F3EC0
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0x09F23ABB
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x44840218
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x3009CAB2
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0xC4713200
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xCF76AD23
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x87E584B0
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x5E28EC84
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x78528142
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0xA44B5670

0x51EF4E84
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xBD51ECD6
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0xC602C5C2
the stair.
0xC69A44E2

0x51EF4E84
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x1EA8A043
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0xA84F4C2B
returns to Madeira."
0x16A7AC2A

0x51EF4E84
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0xF387F5DD

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xEC5F36E7
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xD5FF4016
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0xE54B2F26
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x8C5F1FC7
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0x589DD46E
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0xC1F14C39
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x76E75A3A
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x3C3A53CD
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x461438A8
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xBE13E25F
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x4CF9104B
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0xCB5044C4
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x87742387
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0xF77D0A25
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x6033B86B
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0xA55AB3CB
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x0BC39AC4
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0x3F2CA5C6
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xA8337B82

0x51EF4E84
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xD9B5AFEB
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0xB04E24FF
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xAAFF46C2
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x59EF4794

0x51EF4E84
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x6379BE3A
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x39A29872
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x9A794499
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xEF9F0A64
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x25BC4A9F
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x77B1C7D7
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x98AD99EB
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x67141CE9
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0x0A5B9C60
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0x987AB136

0x51EF4E84
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x3991E47E
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x4F275410
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0x0423C573
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x220D9D4B
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x854F7A90
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xE6B95701
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0xBB09A0EA
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0xA7CC6A76

0x51EF4E84
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0xBA4727A8
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x383CB926
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xD5864B90
prospects?
0x339BFFF6

0x51EF4E84
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x2E82EF96
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0xC7232CEA
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x7793BE87
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x957E9701
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x01E086DD
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x34C9E627
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xA5328A95
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0x55A94C23
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xF6158A63
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x14B375FF
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0xB59D9D28
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x6DCA73E7
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xDCD0A247
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x80B6B6DD
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0xFC16DC75
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x600A7157
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0xBEDA7819
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x8DA23B2D
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x6866A9AE
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x3771FAD7
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x3EA45D40
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x44D89DB7
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x85EA450F
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0x2050073E
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x906E7137
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0xB049F4F3
conduct!
0x30C933E1

0x51EF4E84
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0x024E8164
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x07C434F9
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x7D6B4165
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x1509C2AD
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0xDB193995
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xB77E2D78
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x06A6B5FB
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0x9A65D6A6
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x6BFC6984

0x51EF4E84
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0xCBBCCBEE

0x51EF4E84
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0xF5C3E040
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0xAC140B2D
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x1787F38D
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x85E362DD
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x3163FAEF
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0xA795B341
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0xBA692E78
floods overflowed me."
0xAB6B0A46

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXVII
0x8AA03590

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x1EDA8858
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x1DA10295
"What am I to do?"
0x3960AC7E

0x51EF4E84
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xF94F16BF
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x8B157348
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0xF0CC0C5F
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x8FA11188
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x8341A367
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0x8CC632F3
cannot do it."
0x55D2AFF6

0x51EF4E84
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x72EA94AD
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0xBD232124
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0x2463080C
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x7B0332D2
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0xEFADC3E5
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x81924E8C
depths of agony.
0x4D8FAC80

0x51EF4E84
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0xBD701955

0x51EF4E84
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x33356F56
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x1EC69A61
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0xEAFD30D6

0x51EF4E84
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0xAC9AB5C0
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x81F979B4
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0x1FFF1EDA
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0xE5EA8F95
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x7F469957
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0x51D2D8FE
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x00EF89C9
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x5E056EC6
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x678A8C20
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x0ADF1390
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0xD5873E76
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0x2559ED0A
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xC3F768E0
threshold.
0x971B670C

0x51EF4E84
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0xB40769AC
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xDC732F7C
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x75E1F0DD
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0x09090F05
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x121D75E8
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x56AB4A74
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0xFD05C679
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0x88004442
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0xC5CE8F03
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0xB563A9B2

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0xE9350878
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x4A82C6E6
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x1B905000

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0xF4D03806
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0xFA21655D
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0xCC72ACDE
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0x68EADB94
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0xEB260B04

0x51EF4E84
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0x77042E31
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x09CC23EA
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x1A95F189
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xF15A9A24
heart's core.
0x0C2B64F6

0x51EF4E84
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x10313A9E
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0xF234AEDE
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0x7CC7171D

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0x40FEDDC6

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0x4A712234
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x7B68FB3A
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x25C59018
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0xE1332472
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0xABF120FE
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x8BAA2986
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x7C243E00
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0xF3D241BF
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x42378759
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x3BE0830D
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x65FBFB92
him."
0x5144B561

0x51EF4E84
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x6A62F966

0x51EF4E84
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x030B0D08

0x51EF4E84
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0xFA1D7486

0x51EF4E84
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x0EDC4DCA
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0x2AFFE626
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0x6F7F6611
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x7251B90C
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xFC2BFBC9
put his aside.
0xFFC1FADD

0x51EF4E84
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x4D251BE0
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x0D5AFF92
appropriated?"
0x66B14D7A

0x51EF4E84
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x6C222DF0

0x51EF4E84
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0x12FF633D
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x60A7345B
rightly?"
0x05F704D7

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x0E5F9145
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x295E6350
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xE3ED7EC1
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x0923AC8F
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x82671F20
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x206A27D8
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x95DAF563
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x07ABC2C1
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x657EE32C
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x4BF636C7
know you--I am on my guard."
0x2EB8A3FF

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x6C0267AA
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0x101D960E

0x51EF4E84
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x8EEA5845
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0xD7AC2A1D
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x287DBC57
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x14FFB1F8
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x15D9B96C
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x508D90FC
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x416D2171
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x07CED772

0x51EF4E84
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x4C2F9202
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x682770FC
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x46F0EF80
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."

"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0xCA38E748
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x0E0FA9FC
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x9509C577
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0xEFEA5289
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0x3AC03E2F
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xDA567B44
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x92BCBB63
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x8A4D8464
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0x75C13337
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0x7FE7A77D
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0xDB514A98
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x5C168C3A
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x36A88FD1
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0xEC502550
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x51E0C2A4
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0xF73EDE43
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x3043C662
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0x7B454062

0x51EF4E84
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0xA771F5C8
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x82208FFC
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x0BA45D9D
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0x639093BE
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0xCBFE891B
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0xF505B329
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x44F369D5
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0xE9E60D88
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x1B4463B1
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x807DBF41

0x51EF4E84
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xA72CBA09
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xCE9927F2
cannot help being mad."
0x25CE465B

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0xC1B8613A
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x9D4ED6FA
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x379556F8

0x51EF4E84
"I do indeed, sir."
0xABF22899

0x51EF4E84
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xE476497A
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0xAA5953FA
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0xB0B3A29E
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x85C426A7
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xCF333716
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x2D8CE138
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xA0BED3D7
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0xD7165BF0
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0xAC9A4816
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x1DBCBE72
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0xC679D5A2
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x2A523D62
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x20D12C34
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x81A9ACDB
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x1B5191A2
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0x5C8CAA98
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x1F782688
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x92648B2A
falsehood and slander."
0xF7D27BA8

0x51EF4E84
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xB48F8DB0
for you."
0x2DBC594B

0x51EF4E84
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x27E87609
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0xB1223C4B
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xCFDB3CAE
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xE89938E1

0x51EF4E84
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x7224D984
too dull for you."
0x626FAAD1

0x51EF4E84
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0x7679173F
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x4909E534
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0xB2ED2BB8

0x51EF4E84
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x560E4EF5
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xDC37F71F
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xFA427D3A
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x60298F07
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0x45144D36

0x51EF4E84
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0xFFFEF2E1
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x260B2F40
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x2E9DDEFE
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xAA911853
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x86D98F38
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xB93108C1

0x51EF4E84
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x7E580D8B
before me.
0xB4E4D52E

0x51EF4E84
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xBA1AC3C3
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x01CC5E7F
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0xAEDEA534
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0xEC69FA7E
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0xE2C3E6A3
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0x415C3B7B
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0x9A46CA27
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x24084FEB
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xF6FE3A56
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x4D84FAB6
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x2336CE35
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x29FCFC45
soothingly--
0x61936A61

0x51EF4E84
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x37890DD5
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x6002BF47

0x51EF4E84
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x02328B8E
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x7DF20845
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0x28184693
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0xA58BF14D
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0xB452B88E
heartily.
0xBFFB01DF

0x51EF4E84
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0xFEE31A74
not while he was in such a passion.
0x2DA9D34A

0x51EF4E84
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x13546B87
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x0ECA394C
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x8E1231D6

0x51EF4E84
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0xC1689785
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0x1C4FBD48
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x41AB95C5

0x51EF4E84
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xB25B6DB6
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0xE7E9CDDA
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x66F829C4
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0xB04ED380
were some toad or ape."
0x9A4F7B64

0x51EF4E84
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x5C223C39
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x7DCDC44C
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x960BFC4C
where I had wounded.
0xC24DE2B3

0x51EF4E84
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x4BA67F18
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x03B71649

0x51EF4E84
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0x9797F735
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0x88D2E13C

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0x3AB0A9A7
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0xBAAAD763

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x4E0429EC

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0x2A688032

0x51EF4E84
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0xE9A2E233
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x3463CA40

0x51EF4E84
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0x262F970F
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x3621FE3C
scenes."
0xA90505FA

0x51EF4E84
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x242DB775
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x4840DB12
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xD1B73CEA
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0xE0F19058
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0xDBCECBD1
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0xBBC8157C
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0x838662D7
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x9C7752B9
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0xEDF9DE17
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0xD787D9DD

0x51EF4E84
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0xB4E147D1
still I dared to speak.
0x3B07F724

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x365426A2
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0xABDB0A73
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x8B842B17

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0xA4F21D0A
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xF411D947
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0xDDCAF9FB

0x51EF4E84
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0x875F9317
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x96AE2E21
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x1E8EE8F3
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x2A05ADF7
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0xBCB9540B
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0x0078F95F

0x51EF4E84
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0xC7D48818
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0xF34EF3F4
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0x1C5EC53D
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x7338D6AA
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0xC95425F9
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0xBF348B55
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0xD64FBF02
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0x3371F6EB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xB127D56B

0x51EF4E84
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x510E3829
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0xD8541093

0x51EF4E84
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0xA122B398

0x51EF4E84
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0xDBDEF936

0x51EF4E84
"I have understood something to that effect."
0x5DC0A579

0x51EF4E84
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x9B0B1D32
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0xCB5E4BF1
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0xCFCEFB94
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x0BDF05A8
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x6F81D3A5
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x31054CC9
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x2C5C6CC3
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x26D07056
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x7C7BDA6B
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0x5E06973C
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x607E3B0A
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xAEC29779
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x16538939
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x74E24586
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0xE30209C3
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0xAA2193FF
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0xAB57DC31
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0x836655BB
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x03B69EA8
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x77887ED7
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0xC44FFE1F
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x731E1D77
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xA84DD120
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0x0C89161F
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x90E9A6AE
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x72045FA9
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x942301D8
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x46787A5C
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x5248633E
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x0A23A83D
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x05C4095E
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x4726026A

0x51EF4E84
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0xC5264FF8
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0x426E7B5A
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0xC62218CE
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0x25462832
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0x81ECF62A
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x00427A34
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x404277E8
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x86B81B28
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0xCB8F46FA
plot against me."
0xB33D5930

0x51EF4E84
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0x726E6DAF
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0xF03C9EE2
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xB03F8149
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0x6F89CA88
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0x29673C3B
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0xAFF4DCE7
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x24F172BB
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x595569D4
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x04588ADA
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x186C1A00
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0xBE720D76
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x97416668
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0x0638172B
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x523783B8
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0x30C64C11

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x3EB40BE3
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x1BB3ABBF
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x5B62559E
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0x8D718CEB
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0xF98FD41E
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0x33CD3C4B
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x8D7EBBC2
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0x18C0FAEA
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0xB33A8FD8
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0x6F32A04D

0x51EF4E84
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0xAB1D9452
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0xCCDFBA58
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x9957587F
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0xA5C93520
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x08DA3EE8
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0xF2B53929
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0xAD53CEF5
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0xDDDBAE02

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xBB912889

0x51EF4E84
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0x36C8263C
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0x386B402E
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0xE3900CEC
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0x260721D0
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0x945AF785
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0x41C25B79
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0x9D8C2BD2
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x12958133
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0xECA5624B
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x98717D5B
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0x79621A85

0x51EF4E84
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0x646FECA5

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0xE1221EBE
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0x4D7E70E4
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x6CBC617A
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x8CB3B3C6
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x20B62C1A
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x78116AAB
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x3F92886B
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x645BF2D5
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x9980E04B
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x412F4281
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0x73319825
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x54F960DD
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0xD83361E3
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0xFF1F6FC4

0x51EF4E84
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x5B3BF50A
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0xC7B8D0B8
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0xC6694E46
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0x3FDAE124
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x4EF68ED1
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0x81E0CF65
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xB5A3F152
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0xCBBE0AD3
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0x21309CF4
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0xBA42B96A
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x5463A05A
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0x8A7F428A
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xCC41E661
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xF842CD5D
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x07D85EE5
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
0x475A2296

0x51EF4E84
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0xDFAF3A00
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0xEEF35EC0
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0xA05CE131
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0xAC3D8B71
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x3A651A12
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0x088B0C72

0x51EF4E84
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0xDAF85954
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0x4FD93D81
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0xF5FC9F3F
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0x64E61F17
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0x8F865595

0x51EF4E84
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0x6DF6D020
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0x611A19E8
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0x9C66A94D
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0xF21F90C4
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0xFC499F22
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0x9D955CE3
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0x782FD221
follow.
0xFF4B1C63

0x51EF4E84
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0x6E535F31
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x8386C425
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0xBB9BC009
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0xBBC0CC03
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0xD7110293
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0x947B9CAA
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0x8DF14E4E

0x51EF4E84
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0x1640F8F7
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0x7780D260
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0x90D8780F
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0x157C8063
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0xEC535B05
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0x8861430E
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0x4A594A62
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0x3D9040FE
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0x06F1DBC3
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0x750C6BE1
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0xDE6117FB
and leave her.'
0xA1EC9804

0x51EF4E84
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0x8B028200
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0xE96B3AFA
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0x89338531
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0x57506BC8
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x1ACABF81
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0xB1CB4BD3
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0xEE1083F5
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0x38FAB794
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0xE4D85F5F

0x51EF4E84
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0x25BB8A1F
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0xF90A3500
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0x6EEA9177
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0x80E215C5
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0xE2563217
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0xBC81D66C
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0xB67E59C7
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0x65DCB9A0
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0x8D765F67
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0x878C3071
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x6B7E4CAA
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0xE71A65D8
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0xA28D5532
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x72B89CC3
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0xB756F5A9
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x4EAAAF07
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x587B4C56
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x44FCC5C4
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0xCF2765F1
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x8B423BEE
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0x7ABC6028
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x500FD92A
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x2DA9F121
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0xC76E0F76
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x666D615C
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0xE7B36A20
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0x99BD5266

0x51EF4E84
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xA6364985
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0x33553530

0x51EF4E84
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0x3A758381
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0x52958E2D
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0x03222963
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x336A4E9F
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0xEDD567EE

0x51EF4E84
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x1A20F1F0

0x51EF4E84
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0x1A8FEC76
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0x9E075154
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x5AB5721F
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0xC3BBA7A3
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0xA77B5145
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x6AB44817
burdened."
0xF7993918

0x51EF4E84
"Well, sir?"
0xD5253F43

0x51EF4E84
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0x26BB917D
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0x2969F77B
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0xCD041E2C
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0xC6D46B65
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0x1BB1501D
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0x9A4F960D
don't very well know why."
0xFF4521B3

0x51EF4E84
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0x61DFDE6C

0x51EF4E84
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0xBD067E32

0x51EF4E84
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0x199984EC
and what she said."
0x1A281D42

0x51EF4E84
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0x1CE59171
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0xCEA5B402
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x34DE6ABF
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0x62110EB0
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x969E48C8
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x06DCEC0A
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x41417C16
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xDE1172EE
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x8AD0E2DB
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0xA4817943
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0xCA9FEE36
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x98A5DD36
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x556AE944
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x22CEEE31
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x969C6AB7
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xFBA2CB7A
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x975F4C96
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0xAEB62F98
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x154A05EA
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0xFDCFD9B9

0x51EF4E84
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0xC5785F81
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0xCDD37C3B
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0x16BC2EF3
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0xFF28B22C
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0x54A3FDC0
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0x7028167F
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x53D7DB11
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x262293CC
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x614F3DE7
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x0AAF247F
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x17BD54E8
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0x2AC645E5

0x51EF4E84
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0xEE1E585E
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x1988C56C
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0x1E291DCB

0x51EF4E84
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0xA8D65562
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x76BF2EC5
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0x4C89435C
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0xAC6D4E91
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0xE628B33E
Giacinta, and Clara."
0x8D01B670

0x51EF4E84
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x91E84444
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x3B0102AC
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x07B47274
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x076B46AE
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0x1376B112
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xC2898074
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x912A32E2
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0xE1DC8C36

0x51EF4E84
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0x37AE0446
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x3E6869C3
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x4BDF0DE5
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0xD25858CD
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0x5979DE58
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x36508F17
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x3E760B6C
back to England.
0x00503C66

0x51EF4E84
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0xE15A5791
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xBA696D9C
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xC2016BCF
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x332A4FBE
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0xD65F0807
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0xD9067837
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x65972850
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0xC4E09068
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x6C1649BD
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x6B898DA8
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xE638F607
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x717E101F

0x51EF4E84
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0xCDA28019
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0x44337386
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0x44DC6D23
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0xA99A6AF7
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x83F34792
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0xE2974947
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x6ADF2FDC
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xF5ED97E5
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x28EBAB2B
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0xC4A6D005
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x59CEA3BB
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0xA218706E
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0xC9F7C4AB
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x93EBBBEB
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x023C0043
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0x0B305350
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xA6F13779
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x315B0505
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x6385C7DA
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0xA46EDE0F
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x9CB508AB
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xE0BC55E7
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x2ED97941
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0xC57627A1
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0xC3A69F28
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x7B43236C
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0xCBAAF88E
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0xE4F72003
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0xE305B960
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0xF573C321
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xFF8D9866
out of my sight.
0xB0E06DF1

0x51EF4E84
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xC30BF6DB
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0xBC204DB1
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x3F1BA7DA
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0xD537EC14
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0xEBEABC81
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0x2FBCE7B7
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x7B550520
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x312BB70B
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0xFB7B5E08
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x51229434
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x80EEF60E
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0x1ED1D74C
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0xC98AC613
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0xA9EDAC41
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xC019CEC1
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xBB006856
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x53818744
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x11BA687B
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x99F51778
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x6076557D
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xA234B289
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x6E88889A
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0x04C6DEDB
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0x83C49CDB
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0xA36D1429
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x6992D24E
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x070ED171
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x55FCF5CB
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x003FDC5C
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0xF7C464CF
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xA8B49384
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0xA4022879
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0x2BAC4023
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x305E7A1C

0x51EF4E84
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x84D12452
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x19960CE8
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0x09EA81B8
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x983FFAEF
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0xB65B7B17
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0x31CF7AC1
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0xD6A35D69
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0xF07B9DE8
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x29889F9C
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x274CFBD8
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x63612C00
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0xFEDA349F
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0xE60327C0
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0x6E967969

0x51EF4E84
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x78F0A6C1
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0x20E254A9
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0x825935CF
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0x9DD0EF03

0x51EF4E84
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x6160A504
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0xF13111B3

0x51EF4E84
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0x9201FEA6

0x51EF4E84
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0xC9942B25
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x44AAACC6
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x5480973D
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0xE4A1091A
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x24180066
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xEE97F810
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x424ADD2A
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0xEDA4B936

0x51EF4E84
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xAD2C6303
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x62C4ED36
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x0B877ACC
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0xEFED7405
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0xC7C94783
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x6F2E9B6F
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0xDB99D354
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0xA968E503
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x31713FA6
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0xA1E2B7D9
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x8A605B01
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x5990B721

0x51EF4E84
A pause.
0x76E79D99

0x51EF4E84
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x48A146CD

0x51EF4E84
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0xB8270F5D
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0xE512D710
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x6CA039C5
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x84A83902
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0xA2C9504B

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x867F31C2
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0xCECFADB0

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x7970B3E8

0x51EF4E84
Another long silence.
0xE932FE04

0x51EF4E84
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xFE749C44
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0xC43D4A28
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0xABB79358
and to let me go another?"
0xF9206FED

0x51EF4E84
"I do."
0x91D5560E

0x51EF4E84
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0xD7BFB659

0x51EF4E84
"I do."
0x91D5560E

0x51EF4E84
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0x336FFFA2

0x51EF4E84
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0x954E72BF

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0xE06BBE2A
to love me."
0x8428F80A

0x51EF4E84
"It would to obey you."
0x44561732

0x51EF4E84
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0x09EB1AC4
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0xC4918595
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x64B40CB1

0x51EF4E84
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0xAC402F86
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x7C8A487F
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x2173ACAE
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0x7422A5C6
companion and for some hope?"
0xCC1DE2DF

0x51EF4E84
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x86FA171C
again there."
0x77E9E573

0x51EF4E84
"Then you will not yield?"
0xCBF75DCC

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x6AB1B5A0
rose.
0x34C2D380

0x51EF4E84
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x1E549E36

0x51EF4E84
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x60307D74
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x6DEA9DE8

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x11B271C6
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x4A85FA63
will forget me before I forget you."
0x69FA84DF

0x51EF4E84
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0xBB4DB552
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x16322280
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0xC9018B2E
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0xFE96769D
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0xD539DC99
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0x43F66503
by living with me?"
0xA3A95A83

0x51EF4E84
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0x0E4D9D66
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0xB6ED1450
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x4C926BB6
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x243A8A2B
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x024774C6
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0xF08E1A86
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x7E2589CC
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x7E91BCC4

0x51EF4E84
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0xCE80E33B
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x2F13BE97
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0xCE6B8FF2
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x562786DD
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x9359E81E
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0xE7C4C119
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0xAE1058BE
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0x6312FA79
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0xA721651B
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x4504F90A
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x00A34171
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x64B90CCC
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0x31DA7892

0x51EF4E84
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x7E2F99EF
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x8151D125
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x8B71BC70
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0x95409EC8
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0xCCFC11BE
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x3B340FC5
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0x135C9F30
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x4F81E314
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0xCC4A84EB
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x492C60FC
strength almost exhausted.
0x2BD3DE19

0x51EF4E84
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x0814BEC0
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0xA02ED0F6
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0xA0EC486A
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0xEC8F38C9
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x433B1FA1
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0x6FA2CDDE
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0xA1DCD0E3
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x28F57830
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x20C46B9E
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x697F00AD
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x9AA2BD7F
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x8891EDDE
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x65653061
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0xD37BE480
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x0C3E291D

0x51EF4E84
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0xA1CC973A
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x3F21833A
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xA82D6186
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x79A6FE35

0x51EF4E84
"You are going, Jane?"
0x2486CE9C

0x51EF4E84
"I am going, sir."
0x31536032

0x51EF4E84
"You are leaving me?"
0xDB06F0F5

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x1A2450BF
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0xF01A6D77

0x51EF4E84
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x7BFB0FA7
firmly, "I am going."
0xC68914A7

0x51EF4E84
"Jane!"
0xC3360555

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x5C841236

0x51EF4E84
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x54D17775
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xD456E32A
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x2411696A

0x51EF4E84
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x1B751C0E
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x35E15927
deep, strong sob.
0xCD9F7C19

0x51EF4E84
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0xE5C1FA3D
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x1BC8C4D1
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0xD7FC76A4
hand.
0x9411F20C

0x51EF4E84
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0xFD3D08AF
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0x6335C913
me."
0xA727893C

0x51EF4E84
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0xBF9F62D6
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0xDEA3F0BD
yes--nobly, generously."
0x0DA8AB1B

0x51EF4E84
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xCB06ED88
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x4A571D68
once quitted the room.
0xE420BF3D

0x51EF4E84
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x88F88000
"Farewell for ever!"
0x77B43850

0x51EF4E84
* * * * *
0xAD147B93

0x51EF4E84
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x4969EC27
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0xD6D61FD5
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0xF6CD9B03
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x948BE8AE
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0x307E97F1
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0xA926ECCA
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x645CF605
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x18789586
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x4CE50E16
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0xC11DDFF8
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0xF3AE5134
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0xC3EAEA7F
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x05CA3ACE
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x011B3E61
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0xE86B2729

0x51EF4E84
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x39A56F80

0x51EF4E84
"Mother, I will."
0xACB0654A

0x51EF4E84
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x7D72C53B
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x6D0DEEAC
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x3B02F6A5
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0xB47A9F01
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x13B31AF9
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x5EA8F660
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0xC7296E30
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0x9A1155E9
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xEAD2F0B9
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0xB21E4720
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0xF6EE1D71
from my room.
0xA5DAA14B

0x51EF4E84
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x608D4DA3
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0xCA768CED
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0x55A6ECAF
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0x4406BE99

0x51EF4E84
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0x9471E3D9
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0xA4327CC7
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x75B45A26
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x1CED0846
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x36323765
to go in and to say--
0x5BEF6B24

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x96C0CE98
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x732D3495
this.
0xEB1E5132

0x51EF4E84
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x8D0420AD
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x69FDB880
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x88BA9D7F
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0x0CC32B39
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x76C99352
on.
0x4632A59F

0x51EF4E84
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xE55B3D04
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0x1B4FB379
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xF8E10A7B
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0xD5116E51
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0xAF2BF42B
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0xB3F5CF64
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x8C15EB8B
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0xD1C87BAD
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x75052F45

0x51EF4E84
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0xFB8AB80D
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x538E7528
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x5A05AC10
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0xF96806A9
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0xDB45DBEA
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x4CB61074
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0xAD214BAB
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0xD690898E

0x51EF4E84
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0xEEE35163
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x2BF0EAA3
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x0C1A561E
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xA3ED8CDB
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x2C271C15
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x388826F7
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0xCE95E064
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0xAE762E20
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0xF803464B
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xB196C082
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x00E41DAA
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0xC08FB2CE
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x905DAE85
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x284E4C92
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x120FF801
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x8646464D
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0x4D2CCAB3
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x5A9905C6
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0xB596F055
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0xFF6F3F8E
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x469523C7
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x03D9DB9E
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xCA8F7BFB
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x065A78AF
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x8F482F34
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x0AED0177
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0xCBE47DE1
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x60BDFF9D
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x4F383635
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0x51CF6B55
ever to reach the road.
0x67CC82E8

0x51EF4E84
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x49C8F4A0
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0x7683A9B3
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0xB0BBB10E
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x00EB22E8
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x9D022363
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x2E931BB5
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x668830CD
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x05226A20

0x51EF4E84
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x887216D2
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xDFE9622D
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x1C9E42B2
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0x43428996
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0x145DDA72

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x1D6F53F7
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0xAEF456D3
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0x28D51BE5
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x543AFF10
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0x7970A0D8
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0x3DE5457C
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x848E29D5

0x51EF4E84
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0xA12E6465
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xB8835AA6
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0xD65F7770
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0x261E0342
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x78AEA28A
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0x9E99C8D2
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0xAD5B7FC8
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0x99E3036F
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x62ACB425
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x741BA0D9
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0xF2C92C52
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x3835DF31
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x20A84B86
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x4EA69586
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0xCFEFDDEF
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x22109555
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0xCE318EB0
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x2DF4F535
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x6BF0DB3A
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0xA22DCB60

0x51EF4E84
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x521CEB79
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x272C92A3
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0xB423686E
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x0DFA4ECF
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0x9C0973BD

0x51EF4E84
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x8AEED59F
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0xB421212D
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0x32180D01
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0x24C98B28
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0xF1325D60
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0xB0EE6060
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0x8046017F
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x667738BC

0x51EF4E84
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0xE1D451D1
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x39DA0148
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x80AE5E07
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x50530E53
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0xBF1637DD
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0xFCB9601E

0x51EF4E84
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xED3F93AA
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x1D1CEAF2
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0xFB51E703
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x5D5091FE
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0xCB2CA4B2
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0xBA8D8292
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x0F19A457
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0xD629EE9A
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0xCA0E1F47
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xB246C9DE
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0x81996D31
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x8745CB22
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x940D66A9
then chose my couch.
0x3676E00E

0x51EF4E84
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0xC22737E3

0x51EF4E84
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0xCD10A6C7
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x9E1CFBE7
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x1B47C67A
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0x33F91D33
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x7C1E6737

0x51EF4E84
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x1DE96474
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0xFD48F1F5
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0xE7EDB03F
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0xD04248FC
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0x431B80D3
attempts to seek him.
0xF4EC3BBB

0x51EF4E84
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0xCF3D5A7A
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x9B971FFB
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xB3080340
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0xF153FD3A
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0xA4921832
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0xECB55C7C
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x437AFC26
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0xDB1C1C8A
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x111A8A3B
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x9DD11593
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xB1DD28E0
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0xD202B89A
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x38EC4A57
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0x45E56056
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0xA7B82207
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x7A13C716

0x51EF4E84
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0x566649F9
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x0347B9B0
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x16A7E49A
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x82414BAE
looked round me.
0x31C6561C

0x51EF4E84
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0xEE24757A
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0xFD1E05F7
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0xB9AE47AF
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0x18925B60
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0xA0F5C0AB
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x04A11FAC
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0xB4E82C78
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x71EB554E
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x62C8E864
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0x758462F1
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x90D9CCFD
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x4558CEB2
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xDBF8EEDA
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0xFBE54444
out.
0xB5632E35

0x51EF4E84
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0x7C187DF8
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x55326762
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x99924AF1
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0xBF68F4DC
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x474D0A3C
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0xF46EEA26
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x99B8837B

0x51EF4E84
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0xB4375B26
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x0522F12C
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0xEB87723C
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x8E7E0092
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x446CB4E2
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x6B10792A
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x269A7465
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0xE66325D0
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x0B4EE7CA
like the rest.
0x53E91BB5

0x51EF4E84
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0xCD328F17
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0xEBA0498B
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x4C098F6C
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x0CFFA686
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0xBE97145B
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x21FC6CDD
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x62EAFDA3
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x48B8CD53
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0xFC98BAF2
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x32CA2FE0
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0xC880B980
would not; but I must try.
0xCA6A7E36

0x51EF4E84
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x98665032
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0xE684597A
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x90167577
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x612CFF40
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x760F0C0C
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x884F5F1B
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x80486302
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x2119685F
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0xCDD57088
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0xA59E12C0
the village?"
0x4D3C637E

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x1970908D

0x51EF4E84
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0xF0FABAB5
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0xB054CBDC
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x3850EBB9
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x9DC93DB5

0x51EF4E84
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0xC1512F39
wanted?"
0x50FC7562

0x51EF4E84
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x2DEFFCF1

0x51EF4E84
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x044F280C
do?"
0x6F68D999

0x51EF4E84
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x81BA9DE3
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x96906236

0x51EF4E84
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x29C9EF8E

0x51EF4E84
"Nay; it was men's work."
0xB898CA42

0x51EF4E84
"And what do the women do?"
0x91817FD3

0x51EF4E84
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x5F3D2875
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x9D76BEBB

0x51EF4E84
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x4060BA54
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0x6DD3CCFC
wanted.  I took leave.
0x2EC4B607

0x51EF4E84
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x5A48D93A
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x02AAAAF8
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0xE48CF2BC
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x493392B0
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0xF66D3715
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0x16CA6736
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0xA2DFEF4F
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x48545652
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0xF7AE5B39
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x088568B1
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x3B294073
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0x81B6BC6A
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0xBF580D3B
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0x5B8635A9
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x10114AAC
if a servant was wanted here?
0x70A1EFFF

0x51EF4E84
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x020CCD8D

0x51EF4E84
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0x156553ED
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xF7C9053F
no matter what."
0xA171327A

0x51EF4E84
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x77E640DB
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0xDE4D22FF
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0xFB462C03
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xED934258
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0xAE62010F
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0xC3FB6733

0x51EF4E84
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x537498A1
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x273A6225
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x7A801B94
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xF9B88B41
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x7642F376
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0xB69B7730
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x027290A8

0x51EF4E84
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x4340D161
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0xAB8895D3
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xD09A879E
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0xE4AE632A
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x5CCB3488
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0xDE1D5A9F
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0xE442D52E
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xEF645815
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0x0581EC81
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0xC52961C8
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0xD32E6134
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0xEECDF252
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0x7446F133
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x1DC4D867
this the parsonage?
0x656617C0

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Was the clergyman in?"
0x330125B1

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"Would he be in soon?"
0xC2B4DA8B

0x51EF4E84
"No, he was gone from home."
0xE9716E16

0x51EF4E84
"To a distance?"
0xB2BA0097

0x51EF4E84
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0xC1641CDE
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0x08BDFEA4
there a fortnight longer."
0x1C1FEFAE

0x51EF4E84
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x16AEEF7C

0x51EF4E84
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x1D01CB7E
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x215BFCB7
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x7D9F4CE5

0x51EF4E84
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x8177CE49
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0x87725F5C
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x5314283C
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x1AE5F44D
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0x483C007D
for this handkerchief?"
0x1BEB277F

0x51EF4E84
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0xFE51E614
that way."
0xE8DD667C

0x51EF4E84
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0xE3D6E6E2
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x6235C4D6

0x51EF4E84
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x8FEE9B74

0x51EF4E84
"No! what could she do with them?"
0x0855DF31

0x51EF4E84
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x370D688B
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0xFA7256F2
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x9A1E6625
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0x132B4D24
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0xADE98D1D
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x21A08378
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xB7BA8C0E
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x3CA8A4FE
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0xDE20AFD6
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xD67CA052
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0xA8553F6D
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0x8532F9B3
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x2A727F0F
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0xCEA02A28

0x51EF4E84
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0x2856336E
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0xBB43EE32
said--
0xA747663A

0x51EF4E84
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x95F70834
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0xF480FE7A
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x2F36CACA
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0xD4CDEFC8
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x095B8E45

0x51EF4E84
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0x561ACCF7
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0xCC78FD7F
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0xA43B11F6
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xA7801391
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x65ACE9FD
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xACA4A073
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0xAE7B7405
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0xAFD64C13
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x56C11A19
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x0C2E8078

0x51EF4E84
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0xECC08087

0x51EF4E84
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xBD46396E
give her these porridge."
0x08DE9465

0x51EF4E84
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x152F2404
pig doesn't want it."
0xA918339F

0x51EF4E84
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x8930499A
ravenously.
0x5FCF87BD

0x51EF4E84
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x2840C459
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0xB247C56E

0x51EF4E84
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x5F42F905
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x8E82CAA2
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0x50C675F6
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0xD2592EF9
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0xB86A329E
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0x49AAD839
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x0D9EB151
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0xB43E1179
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0xFC18DBE0
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0xA7E40214
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0xA6867310

0x51EF4E84
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0xF14E0E89
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x967BBBFA
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x13B62831
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0xC0A57EE1
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0xEEF458EE
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0xA773EE62

0x51EF4E84
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x1C0DC584
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x9EC13D4A
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0x016E145B
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x75CBEDA5
grave."
0x5A20FD47

0x51EF4E84
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0x59021A01
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0xB0488954
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x25A8B097
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0xF14F0747
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0x915B8E28
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0x84854F88
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x5E10106B

0x51EF4E84
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xE3F88192
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0xCA54B9AD
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x778E1B39
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0xA3345F5A
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x8655C32D
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x65F6072D
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0xBED87273
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x4B2FB531
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x21D30DDA
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xD09A0990
it shut in my face."
0xE8F537B0

0x51EF4E84
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0xF4CDF5E6
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0x04A9DE61
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x04DE9AF6
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0x4992CFB9
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x383FD7C5
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x7EA9F53F
long.
0xF862770C

0x51EF4E84
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x6519961C
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x7922CEE2
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x9EDD0B83
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0xD00375CC
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0xD427DFD6
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x7E1B00FE

0x51EF4E84
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0x8CE009CD
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x53FF069E
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0xD7C580ED
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x7C25A232
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0x94B6614A
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0xC583BA32
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x2D139D9E
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0x73177D69
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0xF886262A
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0xE32B8701
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x29133126

0x51EF4E84
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0x42C7A1C9
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x5F5C12D2
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x645666F9
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0x3406548B
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x5A052260
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x2CF671AA
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xAA58C4C7
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x669F0FE3
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0x1A5238E1
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x2D259D5D
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xF1A51682
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0x57EB590C
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x5434AF94
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0xBA517E8D
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x68C0D191
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x82074317
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x620B18FA

0x51EF4E84
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x582942C2
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x66D3C459
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x5D42D069
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xEAFA43AA
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x3DD1C364
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x1B24484E
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x7D04D944
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xD14AEB3B

0x51EF4E84
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x0E149287
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x8A2E73A4
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0xA17961AE
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x2CC6DF8C
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x7BDD0BBB
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0xD130E92B
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0xF9CAD30A
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0x99979E08
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x50BE810C
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x392FE436
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0xC929FBA4
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xC34097BF
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x269BDB8D
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x4C9436C7
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0xE8A4BB90
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0x6B49941F

0x51EF4E84
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x7866C65A
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0x1B48DA28
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x839959B2
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0x643DBF0D
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0xCA7C6738
German I could not tell.
0xD51C4773

0x51EF4E84
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x751F3DE3
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x534E6B14
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x6258A842
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x353B593D
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x3F571B87
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xE61EFED8

0x51EF4E84
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x646983A6
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x29E4A6B2
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0xD1787E5F
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0xFC23B8C9
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x45A23E23

0x51EF4E84
Both were again silent.
0x46C523FE

0x51EF4E84
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0xD08ED428
looking up from her knitting.
0x9BE78102

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0xC9D1EAC0
other way."
0xF12085BD

0x51EF4E84
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x320023D6
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0xDD3717FD

0x51EF4E84
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0x0122C4DB
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x6D09205F
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0x6CE0447B

0x51EF4E84
"And what good does it do you?"
0xD77616EF

0x51EF4E84
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x7E43753A
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x4EDFB928

0x51EF4E84
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0x0896D0BE

0x51EF4E84
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x8B570670

0x51EF4E84
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0xBF6E8653
master but a lexicon."
0x666F056B

0x51EF4E84
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0xBA42FE70
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x591DEAA9

0x51EF4E84
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0x884ACD9D
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0xEA5A9E8F
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xEAB9741D

0x51EF4E84
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x6A9CC547
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xE4F5946D

0x51EF4E84
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x622D5FCD
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x6F5C19E3

0x51EF4E84
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x2F9B3C54
sad now.
0x47E250D8

0x51EF4E84
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x083AD53C
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0xA0A825BF

0x51EF4E84
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x69A454D4

0x51EF4E84
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0xDF0FFC89
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x98C02853
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x56EB18E7
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xA6371F68
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x84603DD7
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x53F2481C
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0xC84902C7
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x9BFE3253
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x7F7FDB06
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0xFC0D99BF

0x51EF4E84
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x26BF4582
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x4726AB91
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x07AB2C06
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x03207FDE
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0x5EC56936
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0xC964336F
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x1EC214C2

0x51EF4E84
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0xCA3CA31F
St. John when he comes in."
0xB803BE69

0x51EF4E84
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0xFDFB4931
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x977BBF5D
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0xF1AB88E9
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0xF1304C46
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x6B8C091E
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0xB0551F0C
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0xC29DDD06
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0xEC3B8F4B
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x2CFE064F
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0xE0ECC1E7

0x51EF4E84
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x0D4FB244
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xAA657320

0x51EF4E84
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x27A9BD5F

0x51EF4E84
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x4D413207
from?"
0x4F779FFB

0x51EF4E84
"I am a stranger."
0x82C47C3A

0x51EF4E84
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x59D76BA9

0x51EF4E84
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0xA5B78D17
bread to eat."
0x7095A7BB

0x51EF4E84
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x39A0B2FC
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x1E9C1964
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x00C6FBC1

0x51EF4E84
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xB76F40CB

0x51EF4E84
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x030B3479
now; it looks very ill."
0xBBF6197D

0x51EF4E84
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x4D6CDF55

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x94E2B6B7
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x2755BC29

0x51EF4E84
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0xBF7FB9CA
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x6091660A

0x51EF4E84
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0xBBFFD7DC

0x51EF4E84
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x46A2D337

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x84F54C96
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x158812C0

0x51EF4E84
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x0E40E346

0x51EF4E84
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x882D137E
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0xF41906BF
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0xB20D04F3
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0x97E50527
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0xA8C965DA
bolted it within.
0xA8A70876

0x51EF4E84
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x58A90B1C
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0xD1952746
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x01D60524
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0x4DF2C608
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x860CE050
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0xE0829863
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0xBB55E13A
endeavoured to regain.
0x437E3135

0x51EF4E84
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x2E0E04AA
will in silence."
0x2DCB6552

0x51EF4E84
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0x8F8C77CF
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xA2E14DEB
and still.
0xA30EC66B

0x51EF4E84
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x5D527630
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x5ED0388D
if you perished here of want."
0xEEF6BFB7

0x51EF4E84
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x09AD61A2
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0xFA42EBC6
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xEFD3D0E9
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x9476F164
to the door.
0x7BFC3697

0x51EF4E84
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x1FB386E3

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x2EB6BEA3

0x51EF4E84
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x1DA5F001
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0x320131CF
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0xF57C0051
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x69DBB5A7

0x51EF4E84
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x1068D0D0
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x25A51BF1
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0xF1815880
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0xE309E872
house."
0x52EAE004

0x51EF4E84
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x94A54844

0x51EF4E84
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0xD52F6CF2
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x33EFFAED
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0x1BD4074A
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x4B7F0305
me.
0x75545466

0x51EF4E84
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0xEC04D3DB

0x51EF4E84
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0x400110D6

0x51EF4E84
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x3661DCD1

0x51EF4E84
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0xC7E7358D
sit."
0x6404BB54

0x51EF4E84
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0x8EFE59E6
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x699DCE5B

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0xF7BDD732
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0x5C592161

0x51EF4E84
"A mere spectre!"
0xE850AF12

0x51EF4E84
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x4BCD8E4E

0x51EF4E84
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xF3562065
bread."
0xC092E89F

0x51EF4E84
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x1C141C64
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x863086C6
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x4339A95D
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x89FB5AF3
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xE0703963

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x79858BA4
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0xDCBC58D4
first, eagerly soon.
0x8919B6C7

0x51EF4E84
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0xECFC78D7
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0xDB11F41E

0x51EF4E84
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0xAA4245AF

0x51EF4E84
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x2753D089
name."
0xA5530DB4

0x51EF4E84
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x0448BE6E
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x1ACE6B7B

0x51EF4E84
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x0D5E6D61

0x51EF4E84
I was silent.
0x5CCCE553

0x51EF4E84
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x7D712A08

0x51EF4E84
I shook my head.
0xF8383913

0x51EF4E84
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x58FC12C4

0x51EF4E84
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x3648BC55
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0x00C77CE8
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xB6BEE7A6
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x557CD8FA
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xFEDC6467
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x52AE4554

0x51EF4E84
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0xA0EE5893

0x51EF4E84
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0xE5F78697

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x370D0534
took the word--
0x2345E4E3

0x51EF4E84
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x6CF6D4A6
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0x196F1D5E

0x51EF4E84
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x4C7FD0AF
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x1849D6CB
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0xBE3E8D34
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0xA778C777
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x6F86C257
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xF34CB400
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0xF921D995
silent.
0x57C6A52B

0x51EF4E84
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0x359091A2
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x028E6283
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0xE6236E3D
matter over."
0xB21A6463

0x51EF4E84
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0xC4E44DF4
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xAB1C6572
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0xDA36EE65
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xEF6B480C
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x16A2280F
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x4D4B25BA
joy--and slept.
0xCE85A1B1

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXIX
0x2583D68D

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0xCAC3EC48
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0x3D7401DF
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x67209B42
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0x3690F626
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x83728C35
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0xFDEF2EE9
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0xAD57A26C
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x056FBDFB
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x80EC430B
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0xD960BE02
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0xA4AED4E3
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x7FF08409
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0x44C18515
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0x8900648B
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x8D6AE796

0x51EF4E84
"It is very well we took her in."
0xE0347E79

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0x64F3502B
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0xB12961FE

0x51EF4E84
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0x35DFA64B

0x51EF4E84
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0xFDD29F2B
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x22B834D1
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0xC9173883

0x51EF4E84
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0xA259611A
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0xA2D975EE
would be agreeable."
0xF806BB51

0x51EF4E84
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xAA3E2612
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0xADBC26D5
myself.  I was comforted.
0xEE092945

0x51EF4E84
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0xBF2CF970
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0xFAC8D95B
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0xDE319BB0
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xF042F8C5
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x6C7E1F98
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x5C18F9B3
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x3B8E0400
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x42F29D83
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x71338FC2
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x0BC4B44D

0x51EF4E84
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x3D7BB515
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xB244B01F
her permanently."
0x0C2C3EA0

0x51EF4E84
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x087FC41D
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0x108AFED9
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x8A40F063
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x7F4DE05B
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0x8FA04146
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0xC785FA38

0x51EF4E84
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x5624144F

0x51EF4E84
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x872F37CD
are quite wanting in those features."
0x51C65BDC

0x51EF4E84
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xEC94094E
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0xA2814FE0
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0xC0A25C2D
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0xC4560FD2
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0xA86F76E2
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0x1CCF8CA7
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x0129CC85
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0xEBF56896
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0xEFD755B7

0x51EF4E84
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x706DB716
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xC4BC6E8A
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xA0ED144C
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0x36473261
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x6CF21DBF
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0xB6C2F617
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x9AF4437E
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0xD8B0FDD6
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x5441A8DC
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0xC145C1E0
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0x76B01B30
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x215783EE

0x51EF4E84
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xF4858BFA
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0xABB94CE9
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x3451C31C
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x0620D539
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0xEDF97EF0
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x2D38B58F
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x4393AB05

0x51EF4E84
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x91D34CFB
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0xA359B06B

0x51EF4E84
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x364F7C2C
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0xEA3ABFC7
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0x81E6CC69

0x51EF4E84
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0x9839D5CF

0x51EF4E84
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xF527EA41
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xD8274E07
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x8B60E1B9

0x51EF4E84
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0x58DA344E
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xC19C38FF

0x51EF4E84
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x6CC49ABF
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x7C7B33B8

0x51EF4E84
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0xF2422333
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x26CD4B86

0x51EF4E84
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x75BE434B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, very."
0x18434019

0x51EF4E84
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x45DD5F32

0x51EF4E84
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x40C2DB2D

0x51EF4E84
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x2A83E85B

0x51EF4E84
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x9B40D5E1
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x3DC4AA89
basket of the fruit.
0xE8C12C96

0x51EF4E84
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x187B4AE4

0x51EF4E84
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0xA8166A91

0x51EF4E84
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0xA63024AF

0x51EF4E84
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0xA8F90BC8

0x51EF4E84
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x34B455F7
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x614F1255

0x51EF4E84
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x52B2BABD
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0x27425728

0x51EF4E84
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0xD217D014
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0xE10D0128
are."
0x398FB2D7

0x51EF4E84
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x7C93220C

0x51EF4E84
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0x80D2FC5C

0x51EF4E84
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x6D174F4C
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xA0BB6BCB

0x51EF4E84
"That village a few miles off?
0x74F8B8AB

0x51EF4E84
"Aye."
0x6DEA0C97

0x51EF4E84
"And what is he?"
0xE83E02B8

0x51EF4E84
"He is a parson."
0x8460EAE6

0x51EF4E84
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0xB25011EB
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x19A42829
residence?"
0xCCFE0D3E

0x51EF4E84
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0x5E64130C
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0xEC774786

0x51EF4E84
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0x44C9228E

0x51EF4E84
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x44FCAD54

0x51EF4E84
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0xEAA0941B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Their father is dead?"
0x7671326D

0x51EF4E84
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x0A775440

0x51EF4E84
"They have no mother?"
0xCE561150

0x51EF4E84
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0xEA862B15

0x51EF4E84
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0xF487097D

0x51EF4E84
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0x636F3E93

0x51EF4E84
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x16B1928F
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x7175DAEA
beggar."
0x589CC3A2

0x51EF4E84
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x48ED9A70
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0x7B7C51EA
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0x55487A30

0x51EF4E84
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x549FD8EC
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0xD9750EDB

0x51EF4E84
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x29DE53DC
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x978D7D09
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0xB6F258E4

0x51EF4E84
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0xFDAB94E6

0x51EF4E84
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0xEF1757FD

0x51EF4E84
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0x48A8F994
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x6B1F9535
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xCF7D3E19
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x859A0718
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x4CC5FFB8
to consider poverty a crime."
0xE70A160A

0x51EF4E84
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0xD2DD529B
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0xBBFB2B81
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x0E65176F

0x51EF4E84
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x22422C9E

0x51EF4E84
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0xAEE88E3A
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x1893FCDE

0x51EF4E84
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0x12DE042A
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x0112D7E0
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x59930734
the young people.
0xEA28A08D

0x51EF4E84
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0xB31DB87D
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x648A1855
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x73216316
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x9DA5FEA5
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x53558101
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x84906663
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0xC8657D02
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x87DD30D6
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0x6DA8582B
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x291A154A
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0x2C62A582
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0x7B9A71B2
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x4567792C
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0x2ECC11D7
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xE6C123BB
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x9DB9E98A
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x3AA23933
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x624FDBC9
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0x3EB92ACD
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x2D02551B
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0xB6B943EB
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0xA78A12D9
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0xFFB7E59A
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0x02BA301F
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0xC6165076
for being united.
0x7C0C7EBD

0x51EF4E84
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0xBB198E21
ladies and their brother were now.
0xD2562E7A

0x51EF4E84
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x39E0BFD9
to tea."
0xB99A76A8

0x51EF4E84
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0x6FEC8D6A
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x31FB6223
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0xDFEF3E02
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0xE99938AB
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x614BE9DE

0x51EF4E84
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xFF8B3D00
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x57C1E781

0x51EF4E84
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x4219A991
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x5CA55FF4
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0xDC5A86D0
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0xBCDD03EA
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x9615DD13
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xEBF52AB3
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x8CAF8362
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x752DC0C6
will.
0x9FC43171

0x51EF4E84
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0xD313FF0E
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0xD961457F
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x13F760D6
parlour."
0x0EE5BB37

0x51EF4E84
"I am very well here."
0xBE2B3D8F

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x5C799166

0x51EF4E84
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x19B08FDC

0x51EF4E84
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0xCB0FCE77
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0x3D2AC2B5

0x51EF4E84
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0xB06B2C62
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x55A1CDD4
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0xAB325AB7
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0x73AC50A5

0x51EF4E84
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x0619D88A
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x742BA0B2
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x701BB96C

0x51EF4E84
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x43CAE172
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0xE9CDA917
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x264543DE
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x7AAEFE9D
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0xFA04AF9F
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x29AA3AD7
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x342A3748
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x641EE6D7
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x428E4B39
and well saved.
0x784F73D0

0x51EF4E84
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x6B889726
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0x60810099
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x95662E5D
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x4583F178
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x9AAEFD05
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x5DDA2F48
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x9455C756
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x6DC8942D
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0xBDC72EBC
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x10E25214
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0xD1E8D48A
fair hair.
0xA610B3FD

0x51EF4E84
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x5C4C69D7
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x411BFF5C
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x8D1E210C
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xB867C190
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x3716A67A
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x5526E67D
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x8A47CF49
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0x3B4B7DC2
of the oven.
0x6F570EAB

0x51EF4E84
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0xD0000A8B
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x8F124580

0x51EF4E84
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0xC9862B93
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x8BDB9A9F
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0xB571C65C
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0xAC603C61
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x017180A5
from the stranger.
0x84A63590

0x51EF4E84
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x3F69EB47

0x51EF4E84
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xA067ACFE
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x5C1BAA86

0x51EF4E84
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x5E4F43E7
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x3A75D929
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0xD881997B
immoderately."
0x666F103A

0x51EF4E84
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0x41AE552A
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x116269C8

0x51EF4E84
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0xF91E4EC9
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x5826695B

0x51EF4E84
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xB8F5F6BE
absolutely without home and friends."
0xAD861F29

0x51EF4E84
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0xB1603D8E
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0x40B02FD2
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0xB8E88815
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0xD1DB23A0
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x61BA277D
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0xFEA8E9C6
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x22684B5E
to encourage.
0x5A01357F

0x51EF4E84
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xC7CE3276
every connection?"
0x5D659931

0x51EF4E84
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x0EB28305
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x27684306

0x51EF4E84
"A most singular position at your age!"
0x269A99E0

0x51EF4E84
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x0F4F892D
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0xEE3A8C59
explained the quest.
0xA0265094

0x51EF4E84
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0xABEFBB76

0x51EF4E84
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0xA5B9AB05
St. John," said she.
0x8DC0FEEC

0x51EF4E84
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x228EF8F9

0x51EF4E84
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0xC829BE28
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x6CB58415
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x6D03ED5B
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0xF8F27B15
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0xE8E8DFA4
out tears as well as colour.
0x321B8BE8

0x51EF4E84
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x75690745

0x51EF4E84
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x1C6C65C0
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0xBEBBF492
piercing look.
0x1B25E81D

0x51EF4E84
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x8CC7D946
secret," I replied concisely.
0x4211C906

0x51EF4E84
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0x7B015E25
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0xACFC0889

0x51EF4E84
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xA2F66D62
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0xC76F80C7

0x51EF4E84
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0xC7CEACCE
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0xBB0679A7
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x76ADF9D3

0x51EF4E84
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xADFC9CC0
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x2D644CDC
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0x9D35BD95

0x51EF4E84
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x7F1DABCB
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0xA9E7FD50
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x6451149C

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x4635335D
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0xD342F826
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x10F15471
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xFAD671FD
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0xC29C8327
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xAF7CD240
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xBB643358
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0x8F98EAD7

0x51EF4E84
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x59E9558D
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0xC8CC9152
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x53F2510B
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x0BED19EF
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x7A9C7863
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x84E42AC1

0x51EF4E84
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xF4A7F5DE

0x51EF4E84
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x3A1564FB
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x1516099C
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0xCD53EC97
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x551AD535
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xC57E0EC4
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0x06DF711B
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x8AFEBD8C
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0xBD9A8ACF
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x7CF87749
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0xDE493174
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0xFF2DD8E7
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x208E50F1
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x58ACB6D7
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x5271361D
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xD141D359
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x53BAD1B3
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0xBB181A55
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x3399EA04
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x8497915F
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x4E898A74

0x51EF4E84
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xD18BB9E4
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x3D4277C5
down now, Miss Elliott."
0x015057B8

0x51EF4E84
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x6723E494
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x3186BED5
once.
0xE7864C11

0x51EF4E84
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x5D5E0B69

0x51EF4E84
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0xCB0C8F7C
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0x11F5FB89
sounds strange to me."
0x77DD959F

0x51EF4E84
"Your real name you will not give?"
0xF6DF10DD

0x51EF4E84
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0xC2FA337F
lead to it, I avoid."
0x4BFE1DC5

0x51EF4E84
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0xC2210689
be at peace a while."
0x5DE3964E

0x51EF4E84
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x15B5CEC4
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x14A0B62A

0x51EF4E84
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x642D0230
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x4AA056AA
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0xE91F6F84
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0x17218B5A
us?"
0x5983FBD8

0x51EF4E84
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0x89A51570
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x418C8E17
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0xFE9F1320
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0x7070C25D

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x3421749F
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0xC6FD19FE
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0x417C140E

0x51EF4E84
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,

"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0xA4AE03F1
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x556B27F6
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0x8981AB1F
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0xD5248171
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x877B3F3C
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0xCEC4B13D
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x253E951B

0x51EF4E84
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x7C1EB4D4
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x19BD2FE6
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0xBE89648C

0x51EF4E84
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0x870F8EEE
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xBFDD836B

0x51EF4E84
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0xC3682582
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0xDBE87EA3

0x51EF4E84
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0xDF57212E
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x8B3A6DFC
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0x009727D1

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x44A0E067
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x6F9A9ADD
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0x1C9DF58B
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x604A1C87
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x496883A4
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0x176660EF
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0xED054DEF

0x51EF4E84
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x3E557765
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0xF597A0F7
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xF9459800
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0xAD0A723C
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0xFD234D6D
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0x8C5212AE
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x4ED87FEF
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0xC63D667A
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0x803B4B02
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x9B3AB710
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0xBC5716A9
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x23ACCCE6
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0x9A56CCFC
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0xE0D713F7
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x87C8ECA1
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0xDAF793C3
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0xD65FB673
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0xB9077854
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x059EF30F
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x26E7118B
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x967F032A
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x4953DD9D
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0x37068583
that entranced theirs.
0xF650C63F

0x51EF4E84
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x3AA002EE
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xBB75BDDA
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0xF30FFADB
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0xEAD74701
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0xBA553CE1
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0x9B6A1ADA

0x51EF4E84
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0xE261D76D
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0xAF26BFE0
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0xD3A02D61
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x864CCA0E
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0xE38F0151
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x08DF372E
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x26F51B3B
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x80C4DA68
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xF2780F86
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x9D56FCEB
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x99ECED5D
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x7CA64681
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x69A63D5A
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0xE7A345CB
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xCF7E605C
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xB14FB0AF
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0xA177267F

0x51EF4E84
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0x55B873D5
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x8BBAA7C3
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x3E21DB0D
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0xDE4C1798
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x94CDF10B

0x51EF4E84
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0xAB17862A
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x373D48E5
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0xCA6D7F3A
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0xC9D4363F
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0xDBE1D6B7
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x759BB677
cheerful--
0x3F8B6090

0x51EF4E84
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x20D17C91
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0xA3FF55BE
propose to myself?"
0x72664EEB

0x51EF4E84
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0xEEAC1060
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xC9535D2A

0x51EF4E84
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x47924F40
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0xC789B094
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0xC4D398A8
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0xC6AFF0BC
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0x3B0535FD
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0xEB8CB736
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0xAED95551
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xABB68C02
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x99A5BD08
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0xDDD1FE6B

0x51EF4E84
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0x458DB55B
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x1A84B023
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x24B8ADD9
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x9D69B1B2
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x4839DE8F
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x0930E4E2
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x544106CF
delights they could yield.
0x15622120

0x51EF4E84
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x3F386475
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x4294ABC2
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0x237C9F81
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x6D44018F
produced on me.
0x7E24047F

0x51EF4E84
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x91D4321D
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x1CB04199
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0xD0737F39
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0xBFF046EA
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0xD359505F
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0xA8A6E45D
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x823CABAF
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x609E84D7
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xFA07EE92
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x1F25CF62
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x6D26F8A5
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x273ABC61
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x3F7E0AB6
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x7F00333A
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xC96E59CD
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0xC150C4DF
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0xC1A9AD15
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xBA289253
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0x2B253E12
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0xF30FD579

0x51EF4E84
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0xF70727E1
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x603E4492
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x21211771
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0xC5131DD2
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x1714023C
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0xFF1A1B8A
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x7528824A
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x1EADC010
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x6B1F84DB
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0x8553B0C5
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x51B29077
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0xCAD171AA
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x7527847E
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x987F250E
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x60AD54CC
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0xCDF1A46E

0x51EF4E84
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x979092F1

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x82C08888
myself to undertake?"
0xE19E14A9

0x51EF4E84
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0xE8949C23
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x598BD10A
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0xA015496A
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0xE51F208C
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0xBDEF7C5B

0x51EF4E84
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0xBFAC11CB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x7597C13F
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x095D1715

0x51EF4E84
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0xBE72C940
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x617FB0C6
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x448DB16D
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0x80BC95A5
interest to me.
0x0421D528

0x51EF4E84
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0xC85F23B2
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x9A902A1E

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x8FED1D36
you to accept."
0x18B675E4

0x51EF4E84
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x2BD31A30
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0xF5B784CE
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x27EE5DFD
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x066ADC02

0x51EF4E84
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xC1065294
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0xF8F45E73
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0xD0AC914E
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0x357AA59E
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x880FD719
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x8817FC78
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x4585952A
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xF71FF8B6
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x3717AF9B
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0xF616CA76
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x894BE804
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x378BC5E4
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0xFC1AAB50
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x44064D4E
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x6E3C9B50

0x51EF4E84
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0xAC7EB72E
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0x3F603C91
glance.  He resumed--
0xFDC02CB1

0x51EF4E84
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x9EC545EF
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0xC813053D
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x1586CE64
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x1B0BE09C
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0xF12298EA
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x20753EA9
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x4F83E777
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x9B99EB57
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0xF27BB42B
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0x55448EF4

0x51EF4E84
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x960C441D

0x51EF4E84
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0xEF5FF82B
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x0FAF24F6
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x65405687
succeeding observations.
0xF3E946E5

0x51EF4E84
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0xDBF313B7
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x8AA6047E
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xC7F7593D
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0xDFA666E2
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0xDAE827F3

0x51EF4E84
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0x8429E5F9

0x51EF4E84
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x3EFE06D7
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0xA3B85D10
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0xF5A86A84
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xADD6CDA7
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x5EDB5364
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x16ABEAA0
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0xEECAA23F
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x5D19BE3E
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0x91794CFF
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x1F09D924
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xBFD4D7A6
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0xF8A79AA8
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0xEBAC18F1
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x2F6A2892
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0x49CBB7F0
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0xD103F040
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0x95D7CA2E

0x51EF4E84
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0xCD656C12
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xB37AA3F7
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x66D9F846
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0xD62B3A29
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0x8714FE20
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0x2E83FBCD
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x24D4DB9E
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0x4742859E
decision.
0x9D9B81B8

0x51EF4E84
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0xFB609E26
heart."
0x002F9789

0x51EF4E84
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0xC415F184
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x1565AFD3
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0x7EC8047E
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0xB35388E2
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0x09CA68D1

0x51EF4E84
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x5BE14BE8

0x51EF4E84
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x76098149

0x51EF4E84
"I do."
0x91D5560E

0x51EF4E84
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xBFD34B3E
deeply gratified.
0x5CF9AFF3

0x51EF4E84
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0x388B6897

0x51EF4E84
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x67064C56
week."
0x03DE9F70

0x51EF4E84
"Very well: so be it."
0x35C36C8C

0x51EF4E84
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0xEA6E0812
me.  He shook his head.
0xDC4CF831

0x51EF4E84
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x2DD98A5E

0x51EF4E84
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0xBA6C2E99

0x51EF4E84
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0xB0172677

0x51EF4E84
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0xE9CDE4CA
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x94474AEE

0x51EF4E84
"I am not ambitious."
0x60DC6271

0x51EF4E84
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x764BCCF3
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x14235D46
it out?"
0x1333888D

0x51EF4E84
"I was speaking of myself."
0x84480AE7

0x51EF4E84
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x60BF3EAA

0x51EF4E84
"What?"
0x15103705

0x51EF4E84
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0xEBF3B3B9
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xE2AA82A0
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x17C6C24E
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x54790173
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x99347163
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x6B68DF9E
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0xABB4EB4A
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x5EF755BA
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0x75689963
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0xFE95FF1F
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xA4B94D68
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xB9753F85
some means."
0x8A87178E

0x51EF4E84
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x14775B69
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0xC9BA5108

0x51EF4E84
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0xCE979E21
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x503A1361
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0xCE38CA44
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x31DEC16C
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0xD0363158
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0xA6E07193
parting for life.
0xB040627F

0x51EF4E84
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0xB8F8F623
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x45E7569A
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0x9E247D93
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0xB9886047
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x8F74E6A8
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x886FFA4B
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0xC8A33474
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0x5AD30DDA

0x51EF4E84
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xF977DD49
she murmured.
0xF388D15E

0x51EF4E84
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x2FB0A6FE
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x5ED03349
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0xFAA2E64A
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x06F716BF
letter.  He entered.
0x71F7C342

0x51EF4E84
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0x22834596

0x51EF4E84
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x1956923D
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x129A35C9

0x51EF4E84
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x5C366467

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xE0886CA3
demanded, in a low voice.
0x68F6C331

0x51EF4E84
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x0A0242B7
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0x670C4668

0x51EF4E84
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x9DAFF1FA
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0x6DD08566
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0xCE1B7ED2
enough.
0x9E1B2D77

0x51EF4E84
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0xC832D8CD

0x51EF4E84
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x167DCFC1
Mary.
0x69E24067

0x51EF4E84
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0xAC47EA37
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x4CD57EB5
what _is_."
0x1B5CD1CB

0x51EF4E84
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0xC1C00E5B

0x51EF4E84
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0xA161A615

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x1E1BCCCD
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x655090B7
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x44526AED
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0xDE160D6F
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x5FE74963
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0x6A4436A1
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x8ED20630
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x924D5F8E
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xFAFCD76D
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0xA4E5927D
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0x81FF089A
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x947E131B
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x31ECC99C
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x731303D5
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0xE124AF18
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x111E69F8
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x2CF5F5CF
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x4C0CAC2D
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x5472A569

0x51EF4E84
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x87A7FE0B
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xE12C4AFA
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xE60F2AFA
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x100A32DF
and so the old grange was abandoned.

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXI
0x4118199F

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0xD52BA76C
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0xDE9F7F68
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x8F6B37FE
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x156B58A4
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x615216EF
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0xD85A2901
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x4B88149B
things as are necessary.
0x48125CCA

0x51EF4E84
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x8FB9A4C5
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x5ADBF5CF
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0xE9CAE051
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x3812E97C
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x74F7989B
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x34D70682
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xCEFFD384
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0xDB44C191
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0x15951525
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x292A5A98
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xCB9C0B35
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0xB3B20526
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0xF936DD52
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xD39FFBEC
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0x643B87F1
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x49FCA429
on from day to day.
0x70E446A0

0x51EF4E84
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0x49FC1D00
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x1EB08074
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0x8265DFAB
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x44012B70
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x51115E96
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x318C7E60
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0xB271CB19
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0xC0A969D5
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x76C072C4
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x99419D1E
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xB4BA5D44
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0xCCBDC68D
gratification for disgust.
0xA35AD7BA

0x51EF4E84
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xA3C7BEE2
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0x20DB4B0C
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0xF28E51E2
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x683A5E2C
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x67DC8001
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xC2169114
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x84CB782B
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0xA7DFA1F7
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0x5A293FFE
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x98929AC8
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x5420627C
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x4643EF60
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0x89CC86A0
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0xC1A323E5
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0xE148225C
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0x12192B9F

0x51EF4E84
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0xBC5B3191
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0xF48B16AB
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x61961940

0x51EF4E84
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x4439A1CE
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xA2508FE9
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x8AD86B2E
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0x0C65E2F8

0x51EF4E84
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0xC4281B12

0x51EF4E84
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0xC455804C
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x8C65F0F3
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xEDFEA9C1
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0xCE4E1ADF
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0x3FD1149C
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0xD7262670
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0xD53D1A25
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xC8270142
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x20D58DF0
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x2E8DD34B
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0xB43D0086
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0xFAD5C0F5
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x33E7F0E6
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0xE79266A6
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0xCEB15877
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0xCDA33EE2

0x51EF4E84
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0x965A26A6
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0x68B1C100

0x51EF4E84
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x6585490E
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x8C5CE230
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x51765C4F

0x51EF4E84
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0xF7C3BF9F
asked.
0xB474351E

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0xB8E73DB6
scholars very well."
0xF2334D91

0x51EF4E84
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x76238D35
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x248E235B
I interrupted--
0xE754E533

0x51EF4E84
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x1A154ECF
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0xCCAA45A7
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x1FFB1992
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0xDB29D015
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0x2C04766D
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x75A15FED
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x78956203

0x51EF4E84
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x19DFD0DB
is dark and empty."
0xD072FD65

0x51EF4E84
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0xE95E4764
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x61181985

0x51EF4E84
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x1C0898E7
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0xF8FA11CA
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0xAD0886E6
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x62F48EA8
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0xD890C720
steadily, for some months at least."
0x5A942626

0x51EF4E84
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x9FA2C51F

0x51EF4E84
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x0804E64E
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0x2CB9E5E1
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x8E7CC537
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xC634EA4F
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x8D07C3D1
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0x51E3B864
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x10627982
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0xD6D5C6C2
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x87AE613F
rougher than it.
0x30221CF9

0x51EF4E84
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0xA255F0BC
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0x4257E498
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x74BC5E50
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x2D6EE546
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x50100CBD
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x1F26A630
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0xC0E34433
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0xD6C26889
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0xA4FF2728
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0xD9012454
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xB6F917DC
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0xC0320CEB
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x737BD851
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0xF5716812
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x06979F02

0x51EF4E84
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x31EE4847
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x06793B50
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0xFD0CF20B
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x7B6417F1
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x9992F731
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x3252C0C2
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x3EA764B8
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0x8A6A072E
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x04AFBA5F

0x51EF4E84
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x4F76B485
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x29953C8E
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0xBDAE7EED
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x7D7ABB6E
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xDEE2AD18
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x310055E5
exclaimed--
0x55167D79

0x51EF4E84
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x98D49805
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0xD8C42A5D
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xBFFB7134
your back towards me now."
0xE7C30120

0x51EF4E84
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x45E68B87
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xC6A6EF21
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x39F0B98F
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x7D24E616
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x9E91782C
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0x0A3113A0
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x8A644C53
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x0B36F365
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0xFDA8E584
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0xA80E9E66
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0x88E22827
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xD07DCD32
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x1C29BE39
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0x003413A0
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x3B91F6EC
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x7DF6AF3A
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0xCE3D93B7
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0xB162C804
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x09ED5F47
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x04F39D07
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x90D9B65D
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0xE4C86B4D
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x8EDDDACE
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x93EDA964
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x301D84C2
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x5E4D4285
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0x08FF2664

0x51EF4E84
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0x9F3F4161
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0xD13D7C0A
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0x1D226F89
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x69DDCD50
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x2CFEC4E7

0x51EF4E84
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x4B607B75
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x8578DD4F

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xD12E175F
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x90E3A871
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0xAEEDAE3C
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x9A700F93
pointing to me.
0x66322F28

0x51EF4E84
"It is," said St. John.
0x0DC082F4

0x51EF4E84
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x585A4EB3
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x60BF03A4

0x51EF4E84
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0xC3AC90CF

0x51EF4E84
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0x9A45BDD1

0x51EF4E84
"Quite."
0xCB571E53

0x51EF4E84
"Do you like your house?"
0x07C8BDF2

0x51EF4E84
"Very much."
0xEFC7BF0E

0x51EF4E84
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0x13FB5F72

0x51EF4E84
"Very nicely, indeed."
0xFD51E5DE

0x51EF4E84
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x24BBEB1D

0x51EF4E84
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0xEAEB11BB
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x040DEC61
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x7CA89A48
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0xB98E775A

0x51EF4E84
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xDA50D2E7
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x0134F0CE
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x882990A8
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0xE2B66E54
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0x0EFC3B8E
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x20B24059
merchants to shame."
0xA96EA222

0x51EF4E84
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x2D292990
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0xCBEC017B
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0x40ADC1B2
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xFD62D0B1
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0xAD46DE30
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x31050056
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0x150F38FF

0x51EF4E84
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0xD6376AED
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x42FC7C65
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xD8746100

0x51EF4E84
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x85F7072E
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x24969287
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xE7EC7FB6
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0xFCCC6559
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x130392BB
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x51B466F5
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x67EE771E
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0xE6A1E73D
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x3276C280

0x51EF4E84
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x146BCA94
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x46C1CF7A
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0xDFF1B8BB

0x51EF4E84
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x60B37806
John.
0x0B027D3D

0x51EF4E84
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x13D9D305
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x577C4309
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0xD27579C2
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xA6D33C37
her own.
0x05AFFB96

0x51EF4E84
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xDC7F69AE
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0xC3C8A4BB
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x9BF71F74
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x303C75C6
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x2E1CFC46
papa."
0x77B297CF

0x51EF4E84
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x2D5DB805

0x51EF4E84
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0xEA3B00F8
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x01A94737

0x51EF4E84
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0x44FA3791
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x815F98A9

0x51EF4E84
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0x124E7647
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x6AAC6B62
returned.
0x9BADA561

0x51EF4E84
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x1660980D
blanched as her gown.
0x1068CD4B

0x51EF4E84
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0xA48C25DB
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x15C73D22
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x1E88BCA6
at all.
0x0120A5E6

0x51EF4E84
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0xAE35F8EF
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0xDA96E117
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXII
0x930D9CEA

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x424A3FC6
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0xECD71BA5
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0xEF0B951D
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xEEBD1793
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x2D61255A
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x9F571E08
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0xEF3E4426
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0xFBA6386A
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x1467CA4E
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x2E2D46E7
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0xD768C8FA
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0xB91C857A
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0xE7FC6801
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x6E237F81
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xDCEF51D9
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x91238F50
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x28BB3F82
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x989000CC
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x4267DBB2
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x30D4CB2F
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x926763E3
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x9A586275
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x9FF37173
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x9FD821AA
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0xE5EEE362
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xCBF330D8
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x1287A864
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xF362C4BE
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0x9997008D
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x30B036E6

0x51EF4E84
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x083535B8
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0xC23240A2
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x656E3D50
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x00D9FA33
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0xAE22A149
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0xF47A1A4D
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0x9A6C67D8
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0xFD653D40
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x6B456D72
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x3CD10CAD
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0xB841C5D5
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x9983CF88
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0xB6C4BAAF
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0xBCB79D1B
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x7A756E86
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0xF115517B
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x805F2400
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x962636DD
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0xEBB40EB1
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0x38B17C8D
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0xF518E844
duties of the day.
0xA6136330

0x51EF4E84
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0x62D7BBF0
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x229A631E
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0xEDCBEDE7
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x0BD922BB
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x172B9FED
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xB89DAF33
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x97E2BC4C
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x0F99D6E0
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0xAD3E5EA2
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0x0FB7638D
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x8F1C7967
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0xBACCCB6D
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x26EAD5F3
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x70B3A66D
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x26FEAE56
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x0D519777

0x51EF4E84
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x69A76C20
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x277590EB
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x1013CA6D
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x6CD592C4
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x29BAC7BC
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x0A3DF7EA
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x6491E878
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xE605DB77
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x592C3F4B

0x51EF4E84
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x099B7AD8
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0xEF268C61
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0xAD8345E7
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xFB9E6E05
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0xB6012717
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0x2CA049D3
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x3C28BF01
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x5EEB8289
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x0F3DFD6C
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x794C3346
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x156E3FB9
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0x9FE1F414

0x51EF4E84
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x199A2160
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x639F02F4
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xE7CE8EA1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xBDF2343F
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x5D843DAB
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0xF04EED77
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xDC1BB337
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x3A9C71F8
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x61C66C63
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x787E71AE
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0xE1DEE3E3
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xC718F764
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0xA317DB38
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x367AB336
acquaintance.
0xB48CA6F0

0x51EF4E84
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x200287C4
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x38CE63F9
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x731BB204
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0xAE6D1918
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x05969AE5
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xC52087FA

0x51EF4E84
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x667A6ACF
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x9BDCA7E1
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0xCEE72D40
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0x3D025EC7
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0x64C6D4AB
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0xC404F5FD
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x3A462FEB
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0x3BE43972

0x51EF4E84
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x6107EE88
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x49362C5D
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x135A69D0

0x51EF4E84
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x8D47FA27
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0xF307F55C
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0xE5433A95
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x8803E7EB
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x17533876
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0xE431E64D
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0xF3BA91DE
day.
0xA501AC9B

0x51EF4E84
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xBE527825
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0x371BA8A2
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0xDEA075DE
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0xB877560F
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x26C0953C
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0xFFA87D98
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0xE7F27FBC
Hall.
0xA55283E2

0x51EF4E84
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0x7E6C4D91
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x00374AC6
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x5B3C304E
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0xF1B08CED
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0xDD57F2CE
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x076BFB8E
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x44F13EB6

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0x0A355145
high family, papa."
0x941624BC

0x51EF4E84
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x20A65576
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xD2DD615D
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0xE21E14F7
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xDE11CBB8
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xA644B573
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x6A9CBBCD
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xF244259B
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x7E42F05D
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x07052ACE
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x1AFD6A22
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0xDA29B186
compensation for the want of fortune.
0x4EE31E09

0x51EF4E84
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xF208D80E
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0xC3457DE4
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x128AAF47
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x3B4BB341
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0xD60AF6BE

0x51EF4E84
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x447C7886
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0xFA3DFE38
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x8E15409D
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0xBFAB7D3E
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x4D7CC8A0
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x47DBABFC
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0x319F9AD9
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0xEE44F3ED
Rivers.
0x532FDB03

0x51EF4E84
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0x3425ECD6
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0xCBF21589
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0xC692CFB5
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xC7F7FEB1
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x3B816029
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0xA8469033
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x7FE00FFB
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x5EDFFA95
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0x5D7306B9
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x9277D843
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0xC5CD9F64
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0xEB3FDD82
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x92C2E6AD
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0xC8DB2E2C
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0xB0EED56A
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0x846E5753

0x51EF4E84
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x6054D928
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x5954EF8F
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xB8781E22
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0xBC89E6FF
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x225E487C
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xDABFF7E0
him some good, if I could.
0xED8DBA77

0x51EF4E84
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xAC2ABAB7
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x910EB851
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0x4240C4A7
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x0F7BFE80
him talk."
0xF53B85E4

0x51EF4E84
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x78A5101E
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x18B5E540
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0xCECF54A9
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x82B48EBE
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x82C07CF3
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x59DE2B65

0x51EF4E84
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0xAE209172

0x51EF4E84
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xCF9DD112

0x51EF4E84
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x40D7AE53

0x51EF4E84
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x65929621
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0x9E785076
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0x80EBD8D1
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x2A002AC9
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0x63A69737
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xEEFDE292

0x51EF4E84
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0xE4E201DB
graceful and correct drawing."
0x6A221C1C

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x7E7BBC1C
like?"
0x569550A7

0x51EF4E84
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0xF4C7AABE

0x51EF4E84
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x794079C9
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x0A3234CE
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0xE14D82EE
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x68CA17B7
deem worthless."
0x59C0CDD0

0x51EF4E84
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0x79B51B89
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x5FC8D4AF
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0xD2699382
smiles!"
0xC5DEFF81

0x51EF4E84
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x1E8EC413
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xD7F61278
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x7DD7718A
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0xA5D8CE36

0x51EF4E84
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0xC512303E
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x2DCCA4E6

0x51EF4E84
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0xB009AD00
or wise is another question."
0x8F2C7741

0x51EF4E84
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x395F87F7
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0x5D7F540E
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x5274EB92
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x1C05FA73
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xD3E5D2A4
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0xC25A2674
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0xAEB9EE96

0x51EF4E84
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0xBEB4C43E
take to yourself the original at once."
0x9FBFA6F7

0x51EF4E84
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0xBAA83082
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0xE6D7EEE1
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x50BE8669
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x018F9F93
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xDED6F1A6
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x1E0A6588
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x0BC87E7C
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0xE7B13196
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x7538CE91
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x1E463F6A

0x51EF4E84
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0xEBAB6FB2
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0x92AFC58D
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x495D8F79
ought to marry her."
0xECD54487

0x51EF4E84
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x81297577

0x51EF4E84
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0xBD7CA83C
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0x4018C152
often."
0xF2EF60D7

0x51EF4E84
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x96FC7FE7
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xBC5CF91D
the table to measure the time.
0x6A9A0C2B

0x51EF4E84
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x6EA4341C
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x35833479
fetter your heart?"
0xFD976E4A

0x51EF4E84
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x6D00C10E
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x9320F9DC
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0xF9B56654
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0xA6CE14C4
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x0C864CDD
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x142CD92E
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x99A2CB5F
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0xED9901F3
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0xAF74B04B
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0xE37A9D23
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0x6D05865D
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x30E3AEC3
time I marked pass in peace."
0x0A164E22

0x51EF4E84
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0xF96BB03C
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xB39F8D89
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x4DABB25E

0x51EF4E84
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xC0F2BBFC
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x8D662580
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0xA1387FC2
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x28821AE7
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x12F9340F

0x51EF4E84
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x19077BB5

0x51EF4E84
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x9E45DA7A
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x3B5F713B
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0xBC0B7477
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x00C574EB
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0xDE067CF7
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x39F40440
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x459D8ACE

0x51EF4E84
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0xD6C59AC1

0x51EF4E84
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0xC47506B8
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x7CEFCB72
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0x4A73D55E
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x50ABFD60
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0xF2C8E75C

0x51EF4E84
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xAC1ACCD2

0x51EF4E84
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x0B8CE2DC
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0xFB669802
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0xEE51E15E
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xE4577ED8
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x94E02E7F
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0x103C2823
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0xA57B1315
live for."
0x191683F8

0x51EF4E84
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x261C3526
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0xA2528563

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x917A1FCD
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x44D5A1E1
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x7EF922AF
should do."
0x765EC4AF

0x51EF4E84
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0xFB9A65A8
wasting away."
0xA73A9F85

0x51EF4E84
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x7C382BF0
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x97F68E19
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x049F5B43
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xC53ED290
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x534A2706

0x51EF4E84
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0xDC208C9B
schoolroom."
0xC21244A0

0x51EF4E84
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0xFA378F4B
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0xC324AEB2
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x7EBCECE5
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0xD87D9A18
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x0697DF22
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0xCDF3F118

0x51EF4E84
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x51AD10BE
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0x3639550A
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0x96906FA5
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0xDC8CA5CF
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0xECED4FAE
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x05CA8835
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0xF315375C
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x6146B8E1
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0xD4D18AA4

0x51EF4E84
I smiled incredulously.
0x5DCE16FE

0x51EF4E84
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x89FB4409
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0xCF93526B
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x7CB66D4C
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x8E3BD3D1
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0xAF3D745D
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0x38CC1C59
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0xC6F7D9E6
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0xD120FAB9
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x80D0777E
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x66A54DFA
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x834D7FC8
still suffer."
0xD0A22319

0x51EF4E84
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x2898C2AF

0x51EF4E84
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x997FD69D
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x2CCB5D64
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0x4ACDBD4C
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0xC369DB2F
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0xE23AC408
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x5B08623D
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x9FB90C04
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0x005CD29A
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x40A0FF2C
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0xEA4A718E
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0xACCFD409
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0xF0D6649A
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x1F673CF2
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x5811B67A

0x51EF4E84
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0x586DBB0C
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x334D053D

0x51EF4E84
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0xCD72C71C
World, indeed!"
0xF85A144F

0x51EF4E84
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x8E22DDB6

0x51EF4E84
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0xC2D162F0

0x51EF4E84
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x95F6624D
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x9C3CFC14
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x56D255D8
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0xFEE468DF
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0x10121CD7
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x6ED2116E
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x0A41F23E
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0x256E1912
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x94778D72

0x51EF4E84
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0xDAF25E51

0x51EF4E84
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x6F416A87
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x1DAE33E9
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x4AADFCC8

0x51EF4E84
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xC06BECB2
globe, however!"
0x77032A7E

0x51EF4E84
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0xD99DC397
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x67BF2543
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0xE1998500
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x92E91222
forgot it.
0x23A6C37E

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXIII
0xCA1D633E

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0xA05FE1BF
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x816109F7
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x6C9BF07F
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x81CB6CA8
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x1718A9D4
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0x5A8754B3
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0x984F9430

0x51EF4E84
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0xCDD33F03
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x8C700D3A
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x8F29104C
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0x9887EEF9
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x256E9750
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x4399EBBF

0x51EF4E84
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x782C8BE1

0x51EF4E84
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0xA1043ECC
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xE1B52C87
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0x4373933F
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x7996A66A
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0xB558628C
vale that night.
0x1901E043

0x51EF4E84
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x41AE2E28

0x51EF4E84
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0xA0D7C324
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x6CDCD751
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0x32B14514
boots.
0x22752581

0x51EF4E84
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0xA54D884D
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x66AAF6F1
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0xD8C703C0
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xF10DF3EC

0x51EF4E84
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0xED2305C7

0x51EF4E84
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0x811F80CD
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x97489A4F
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x1F065E56
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0xB26CF0C6
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x0332E947

0x51EF4E84
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0xD5175EE0
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x9607C727
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x06F3766F
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0xC542AAE8
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x50BFFF17
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0xAB44C4C9
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0xD8E3D108
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xA2A77F48
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x55C40ADF
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xC7D51638
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x55DFBDEF

0x51EF4E84
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x7FDA9DCF
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xAEBCA7DE
health."
0x544945CC

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x592ED0D6
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x70383924

0x51EF4E84
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xE7A00EA2
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x2035BCF4
silenced.
0x6C074258

0x51EF4E84
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x4425241D
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x07DD1352
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0xB9D6ECF2
was behind him.
0xB286A4EE

0x51EF4E84
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0x4569AAE7

0x51EF4E84
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x70F51ED3
alone now, and return to my book."
0xB65C287A

0x51EF4E84
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x49540A9C
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0xE1D18B32
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x7DF4358A
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x4E597374
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x4829D1C7
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x3E0D4621
I would.
0x50D2E76E

0x51EF4E84
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x2FE03CDC

0x51EF4E84
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0xBE3A4670

0x51EF4E84
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xCE2451F3
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0x80DADF77

0x51EF4E84
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x8DEF7435
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x13416A09
and my scholars.
0xE71FC439

0x51EF4E84
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x1CAF6350
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x3EF83F13
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0xCD6CA28D

0x51EF4E84
"Indeed!"
0xA3DB7680

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x4EC42AA2

0x51EF4E84
"Does he?"
0x9661AA46

0x51EF4E84
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x63FD41EF

0x51EF4E84
"I know."
0x44316897

0x51EF4E84
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x171DF02A

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"Whose, then?"
0xB07F31EB

0x51EF4E84
"His daughter's, I think."
0x802848DC

0x51EF4E84
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x12B18753

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x47E7F82F
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x84ED7E3A

0x51EF4E84
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0xF86BDF32

0x51EF4E84
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xF7FE6A26

0x51EF4E84
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x7D6A1E74
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x9DB64731
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0x649DEC5A
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x7C03DABC
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x7399098E
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x9DB9EAE2
trite or novel, it is short.
0xB20C509A

0x51EF4E84
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x9F517DBE
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0xACF82F9B
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0xBF9962EE
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x23AFD0E7
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x52A62B38
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0xF07EA65D
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0x4F2439A5
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0x11E7D32B
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0xDE65F6E3
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0xDFAC21CA
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xFBC2BEEA
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x5E738FBB
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xC9C923C5
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xCB41BDE6
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x9FCE8CFA
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x224E7E3C
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x9F193DA4
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x9DBA1509
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0xC60ADA62
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0xACC63048
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x119E563A
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x43E0D02B
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0xDE2E1DAD
Rochester."
0x3D55FB25

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x19DD0B43

0x51EF4E84
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0xC7AA1A81
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x05556C94
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0x86850390
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x4E82D9EE
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0xFFF15DF4
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0xAA8B5641
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xA853E993
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0xF5EDE002
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0xF9CDFED7
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x3A2189B6
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0xF128E13E
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x38FB3719
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x2C11DC55
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0xAC2052B2
odd tale?"
0xADC685E1

0x51EF4E84
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x28A7328A
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x4817F02A
doing?  Is he well?"
0xD33B8C21

0x51EF4E84
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0x73C6A5C3
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x6C22EEE2
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0x11887262
which requires her appearance."
0x740E6271

0x51EF4E84
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0xB7E43494

0x51EF4E84
"I suppose not."
0x5291225B

0x51EF4E84
"But they wrote to him?"
0x5EC239F0

0x51EF4E84
"Of course."
0x2AEB56F3

0x51EF4E84
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x6D1DD2EC

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0x22A98B87
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0xB9B8555B

0x51EF4E84
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x27FA8BCF
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xD45D7FBB
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0xC148BCDC
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0xD3AF1830
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x01488C59
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0x89771B6C

0x51EF4E84
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0xBAB37AA7

0x51EF4E84
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0xE9918C17
warmth.
0x91A2461E

0x51EF4E84
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0xC854AA86
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0xE28ECAA6
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0xE11AAAB8
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0xAF4CC737
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xB6F5F3E1

0x51EF4E84
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x08DA4917
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xAC532277
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x229E9008
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0xCE2069F3
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x82E7AEB9
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x7F55BCF0
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0x3C409434

0x51EF4E84
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0xDB2197E8
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0x0E1337B3
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x8496EFF3
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x9410D6A8

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0xBEFDC996
Rochester than you do."
0x6529F38C

0x51EF4E84
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xCCD1A1F3
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x720823C9
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x86CF075A
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0xF7A9499C

0x51EF4E84
"Well, what did he want?"
0xC4F82BB6

0x51EF4E84
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0xD378DB48
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0xD1A40182
that--nothing more."
0xAF257E72

0x51EF4E84
"I!--rich?"
0xDAF2D038

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x38C35F39

0x51EF4E84
Silence succeeded.
0x010E70A4

0x51EF4E84
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x17F64889
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0x4AE04CC8
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x1B79AA8F
will and the necessary documents."
0x1CD10BE6

0x51EF4E84
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0xBB333B41
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0x486E8DA8
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x8962DB37
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x7745B38B
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0xAC301F47
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x397F0E12
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x4226D34C
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0x3D0C465D
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x15D3CB80
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x6494545C

0x51EF4E84
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x9A37E310
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0x711BCA3F
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x7A5765DB
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x9D979510
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0xEF1FF0F5
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0xC957309C
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x5B37FE7E

0x51EF4E84
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0x7F768C5A
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x7357E1FF
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x0C2D9203

0x51EF4E84
"How much am I worth?"
0xD3594283

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x6A1DF55E
think they say--but what is that?"
0xD29E7C2F

0x51EF4E84
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x57336957

0x51EF4E84
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x569CB2C7
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0xBBFC7CE7
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0xC8B16D40

0x51EF4E84
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0xBA4BF178
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xB60E7A7E

0x51EF4E84
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0x9DBFB46C

0x51EF4E84
"No mistake at all."
0x01F9954B

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0xA1BFE30B

0x51EF4E84
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x567D2B35

0x51EF4E84
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x03D60877
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x23B73193
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x499AC275

0x51EF4E84
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0x9FA2EE41
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0x912A7530
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x7DE4D681
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0xE5DE25CA
Good-night."
0xE97209D5

0x51EF4E84
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x39B065DD
minute!" I cried.
0x1ADA9F29

0x51EF4E84
"Well?"
0x2FADD6BF

0x51EF4E84
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x5B2E63F1
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x73259EB1
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xE77FE950

0x51EF4E84
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xBE0E0757
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0x2A21F245

0x51EF4E84
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x6ADE5023
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x7C6FBF88
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0x42A4D5E7

0x51EF4E84
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x948EF275
about it."
0x2E7ED35E

0x51EF4E84
"Another time."
0xB0D360D8

0x51EF4E84
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x0F09D19D
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x5BEE3822

0x51EF4E84
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0xDE4B2592

0x51EF4E84
"I would rather not just now."
0xE206F65A

0x51EF4E84
"You shall!--you must!"
0xF0AB325A

0x51EF4E84
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0xADB613F6

0x51EF4E84
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x272CF85D
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x5152B53E

0x51EF4E84
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0xF998F3BB
persuade."
0x693F864A

0x51EF4E84
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0x2D170CAD

0x51EF4E84
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0xE133D595

0x51EF4E84
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x03ADB95B

0x51EF4E84
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x1B099323
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0x799CA2C3
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0xE320DA2E
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0x754771FF
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0x593E8B21

0x51EF4E84
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0x55A63DD9
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0xB5E0F6A0
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x5FFCE357

0x51EF4E84
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0x4D062247

0x51EF4E84
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xF867DBEE
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0x2E815E58

0x51EF4E84
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0xD4DDC7A2
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x8A4C1DE9
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0xF5784BD6

0x51EF4E84
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0xA4A7B51C
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0x53426D6E
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0xCDD8AF39
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x640CBBAE
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x35528948
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xBBE8755A
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x633C97AA
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x9B92A697
explanation.
0x513B0F01

0x51EF4E84
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0x46D3AD3F
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x28F0EC57
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x3703C11B
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0xF50B6838
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0xD057B7E8
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x6EE4908D
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x0FB86909
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x177BCC7E
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x61457EA5
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x3FECC5AE
against the door.
0x233A3870

0x51EF4E84
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xADE5FB89
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0xE1CFB4C2
enough.  I resumed--
0x70EBAFCD

0x51EF4E84
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0xBA7F729D

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x6B654FCC

0x51EF4E84
He bowed.
0x99216F3F

0x51EF4E84
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0xD1B2B8CA
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0xAAF897DF

0x51EF4E84
"Undeniably."
0xE2536CB4

0x51EF4E84
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x0D1F2627
the same source?"
0x93E1AD9A

0x51EF4E84
"We are cousins; yes."
0x7B2139A4

0x51EF4E84
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0x8374CFED
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0x60B5432B
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x3D3D2988
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xFBEB6F8E
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0xBCEB20A2
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x55DEB62B
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0x1A78F0FB
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x42C90192
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xBECA9BDD
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x585D8EB8
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0xACA4D960
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0xD2B9C731
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0x90EE1BCA

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0xEF3F865F

0x51EF4E84
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x4FFB21E6
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x5B7B1C6B
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x23DC5485

0x51EF4E84
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x13FEE14C
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0x07144ECF
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x8BB2018E
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0xC313DD30

0x51EF4E84
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0x7C4E6B42
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0xD7F7B191
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x2226406C
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0xA0119ABA
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0xC50BEDCB
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x3CB9B6B9
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0xA73F9061
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0x33CDA31E
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xCBACDCA9
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0x3AA843AC
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x7A09AE65
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0xBB86511C
enjoyment.
0xFFA302BA

0x51EF4E84
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x72138F69
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x2209F407
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x2109647F
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x99D58E1B
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0xCBE8B83F

0x51EF4E84
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xD800871A
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0xE37EEB02
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0x97AAA0A6

0x51EF4E84
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0x5E03C2B0
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0xAC028983

0x51EF4E84
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x9CB5F797
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0xA384F7DA
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x9DB1DA34

0x51EF4E84
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x458C0191
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0x1ED7944C

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0x427F4474
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0x0758DB68

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0xB82D70D1
comprehend better."
0x857ED62F

0x51EF4E84
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0x9865FC59
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x44E2B466
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0x16EBD296
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0x86524FEE
fortune that has accrued to them."
0xF5EAFA71

0x51EF4E84
"To you, you mean."
0xB574579B

0x51EF4E84
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0x0F53BF08
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0xDCEB7FBF
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0xBBBD9F43
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x47DEC345
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0xFA676B48
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0xE1239B6B
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x0CD46CBB
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0x4993B0EC
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0xA3C0AF6E
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0x16A99298

0x51EF4E84
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x8050E03A
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0x71462D11

0x51EF4E84
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0x39FB9251
the case?"
0x010EC556

0x51EF4E84
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0x5D9896D7
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0x4405614C
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x7E8B2C17
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0x4E96FACD
consider it absolutely your own."
0x36A804EE

0x51EF4E84
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0xB44A1D90
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xC6786EB3
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xD9CE00E0
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x734FAB68
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0xFF703E1F
myself lifelong friends."
0x7C4ACC3F

0x51EF4E84
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xBACD4BEB
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x726AF39D
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0xAF5BDC5E
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0x97E7DDD2
you: you cannot--"
0x78325495

0x51EF4E84
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0x08ACE925
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x97787058
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0xA81AEC75
and own me, are you?"
0x51DF6789

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x98CAF9DC
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0x40B85143

0x51EF4E84
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x2F373D9B
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x1A0BA16F
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0xD4D0DD9A
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0xDE38FB58

0x51EF4E84
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x6D4D5704
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x18500862

0x51EF4E84
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0xF33B5722

0x51EF4E84
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0xA68315D3
excitement under which you labour."
0xB0FA0578

0x51EF4E84
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0xFA4BC33B
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x3D47B8AD
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0xF59F1BE3
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x51C85FD2
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0xD0109F4C
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0xA95EB223
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0x481F8E1F

0x51EF4E84
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0x61F6A450
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0x50B19419
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0x00E464EA
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x0BF87BDF
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xFA26B465
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0xB1000BFC
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0x4E263A22

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0xB684E1BD
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x94AEADC9
scruple."
0x8D0D7359

0x51EF4E84
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x9F8335DA

0x51EF4E84
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x98114F5F

0x51EF4E84
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x598096E9

0x51EF4E84
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x44757464
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x19BDDA35
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x43AFCF54
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x60772FE4
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x63F69232
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0xC38D05A4
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0xF21E90B8
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x89E825C8
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0xCCFDFD23
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x38AEED73
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
0xA5D315F3

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXIV
0xEEFBC43D

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x6123DF87
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0xA76A2B00
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0xFC043D62
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x595340DC
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xA4778F25
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x6E430B57
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0xEAB073AF
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x3910DC61
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0xDA3B1FDA
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0xF23537C7
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0x6B9E6091

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0xE1C69A33
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x337B38D2
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xBBF0FE13
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0xFD147B13
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0xD9E698F2
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0xE574DAFC
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0xF9402EBB
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x0DDCFB69
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x6F2398E2
girls.
0xB0C6A4CC

0x51EF4E84
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0xDC23ECA2
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0xC0E960BE
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x368637B8

0x51EF4E84
"Doubtless."
0xD7B3686A

0x51EF4E84
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0x2F783C21
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xCE66C405

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x986955E7
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0xE8688049
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x6B30DDB0
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x426C927B

0x51EF4E84
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x9F30EC33
What are you going to do?"
0x37B7D23D

0x51EF4E84
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0x727654E4
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x98A57A97

0x51EF4E84
"Do you want her?"
0x326F3F9E

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x9E35049D
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x5784D54C

0x51EF4E84
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x2DC021D8
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x2D40068F

0x51EF4E84
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0xA4E221EC
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x34E8D832

0x51EF4E84
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0xE25B279B
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x0270CD09
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0x5D191B6C
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x6FA0342A
now?"
0x87588950

0x51EF4E84
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x8171EAEA
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x5B3CB133
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x98097BAC
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0x37FFB0CB
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x10D71DA0
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x4CAB1DF2
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0x0D277520
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0xFB8A49FB
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0xBAE4DC54
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x9A6990D0
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x540B3FB6
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0x4D038437
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x401795B5
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0x40663DD7

0x51EF4E84
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0xBD69C42D

0x51EF4E84
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0xAB847083
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xDA671C63
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x2DB8FEBF

0x51EF4E84
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0xE7A02E49

0x51EF4E84
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0x3590D139
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0x109889FD

0x51EF4E84
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0xC5E4C5F6

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0x07EDD5BE
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0x19BAF46A
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x59E72A7B
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x781001B1
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0x4C6AAE65
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x603A183F

0x51EF4E84
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0xAAE0B3EB
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0xA7358870
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x56D849A1

0x51EF4E84
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0xE6E17C39
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xD4664A2D
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0xB75B140C
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0xB21BEF30
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0xDE910244
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0xDBD01978
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x78359004
hear, Jane?"
0x9892ADCC

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xD2736733
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0xFD0E2243

0x51EF4E84
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x16DB0CF2
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0xB5C46F07
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x671D1857
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xC3B05F9D
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xCF4D8C65
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0xD83293AD
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x98BCAFF8
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x11D07DEE
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x5D846627
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x3AC6A865
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0xD867023B
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0xEDAEBA50
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0x7112B87C
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0xFC862383
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0x6B9D9DA8
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x931EF777
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0xBC1FB0FA
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0x80688623
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x48431082
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0xB94E6B7A
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x2B45BDE1
without.
0x9340EFE7

0x51EF4E84
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x58884077
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0xA647C11A
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0x6C1D5354

0x51EF4E84
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0xC901A3C5
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x64211188
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0x8844699A
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x8AB6D857
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x27036F91
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0xB2E954FE
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x2494CD0D
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x9E02AA2E
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0xD30E82F8
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x08EE264D
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0xA66605C2
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x5DBE8D35
improved aspect of his abode.
0xA623BF2D

0x51EF4E84
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0xE3FE6B35
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0x2D6A26B4
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x54ED5951

0x51EF4E84
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x3E3075C2
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0xD8367948
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0x0262FE2A
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0x621963E3
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0x05524D44

0x51EF4E84
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0xAE64161A
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0x03AAAD4D

0x51EF4E84
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x3D6551D0
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0xC77AD88C
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x47DF7353
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0xF5C5A2CD
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x5EDD5CAA
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0x71A859F1
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0xC492FB70
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0x149501B7
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x3A303519
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x5A918AA5
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0x0B16A224
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x23C7AFE0
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0xAA063DB3
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x5E877C07
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0x01A1E83B
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x744B3DD7
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0xBBC6EB1E
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x93D45D2B

0x51EF4E84
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x042B0E05
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0xE38CBF47
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x2311B3A8
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x60A65622
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0xE2C0D01E
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x76C30411
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0xD4649CAE
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0xF567D571
career--I see it now."
0x0DF75002

0x51EF4E84
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0xA2F19CD6
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0xA229D7B1
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0xA816F7B9
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x355C83A3
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x8D735C36
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xC706C6B6
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x5D301CDD
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x3F848BA8
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0xF4630CD9
into the house.
0x54FDD58E

0x51EF4E84
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x7699F2AB
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x18DB4D11
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0x097615F9
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x9822590A
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x59DAB45D
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xA5D3B521
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xDA8A6839
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x5A2E32B5

0x51EF4E84
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xEEFE605F
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x28E8C26F
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xB5109169
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x32E97C7D
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x4A36575C
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x78237E7A
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0xB0F9A6C7

0x51EF4E84
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0xBF9EDC6B
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0xFEFD7A6C
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0xA0F9C46C
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0xB6930F08
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0xDBDC7385
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x1ABBBA67
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x1F0E6FAA
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0xEE28AC87
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x9318E53D
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x68897609
mother, who was drawing away."
0xA8CE78F6

0x51EF4E84
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xF0D3FB94

0x51EF4E84
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x15F80C81
the way."
0xEE44762D

0x51EF4E84
"Tell him I will go."
0xD656C6BC

0x51EF4E84
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x5F3F9338
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0x68C469B5
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x34F2F341
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x794CFA7B

0x51EF4E84
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x3711C894
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x46E8EEB0
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0xD6B2EC7B
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xB51E9301
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x52086B68
with himself.
0x7D8C58EA

0x51EF4E84
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0xF01C2D83
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0xE79FCC2D
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0xB467DA32
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x71D743DB
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x49F46A38
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x06B1DEB2
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0xB68F5782
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x4764B0E3
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0x6764BBA1
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0xF9F60B74
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0x16FCE44C

0x51EF4E84
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x967E9F96
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x5EF14E98

0x51EF4E84
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x031B0FBF
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0x5DDCCF0A
ensuing year.
0xAE68940C

0x51EF4E84
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x9A9F634B
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0xF21E26AD
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0x0D5E2D78
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x40BAADFB

0x51EF4E84
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x7CE4CFBA
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x84F749D4
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0xC8DE733B
yesterday."
0x96F913F7

0x51EF4E84
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x355D823A
he was serene as glass.
0xE278DDBC

0x51EF4E84
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x0BCAA71B
known each other long."
0x175A3784

0x51EF4E84
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x04DC044E
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x1AEB788F
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0xD63B2148
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x4790EA40
can he refitted for their reception."
0x5BC7083D

0x51EF4E84
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x14E6024F
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x6C46F46F
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0xCFC33B66
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0xF1415F5F
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x63B14299
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x8153B2FD
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x43F879ED
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x96E87853
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x1355D5FE
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x5F6331D0
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x620382E1
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0xA5A2F1E6
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0xA8B59563
frigidity.
0x632F543E

0x51EF4E84
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0xFBA6F881
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x417F7BE9

0x51EF4E84
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x506433BD

0x51EF4E84
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x3BB64191
moment's hesitation I answered--
0x9A86594D

0x51EF4E84
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x1A289D73
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x065B3757

0x51EF4E84
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x6EA08353
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x546E8680
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x56FEE794
returned to his papers and his silence.
0xB0F65E4D

0x51EF4E84
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0x437592D9
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x85D0369D
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x74CD3C10
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x8C86DE7C
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x0DBD9D23
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0xAB1D2B08
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0xCD2C432B
plans.
0x1F1F9EE8

0x51EF4E84
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x70EC0ADE
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0x43D461AF
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x6D6097A8
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x3A06837E
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x0E66F33F
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0x6A323BD8
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x95A3159C
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xA4A59AD2
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x400E6D86
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x007E46C8
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0xECB71A03
the task without regard to the elements.
0x2A44AA31

0x51EF4E84
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xA8B86EA5
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0xD92A9063
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0xC0CA99F8
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0xEB149085

0x51EF4E84
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x1BA80E3F
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0xD99EE24A
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x91BD46CA
was a special annoyance.
0x563FF060

0x51EF4E84
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xC405790D
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x777445AA
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x52855BBD
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x3D4ACB41
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0xEACF08F5
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x351775A1
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x433F429A
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x16881D43

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0xB8D8CDB4

0x51EF4E84
"Learning German."
0xB56AA000

0x51EF4E84
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x3BA85893

0x51EF4E84
"You are not in earnest?"
0x69259D67

0x51EF4E84
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x1C0B9A43

0x51EF4E84
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0xFCA6CBF7
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x52E8CB2B
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x642CCAB1
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x0591C12F
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x8C94C848
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xCD5411D2
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xF24F78FD
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x1135C2F0
barely three months to his departure.
0x15D44CC8

0x51EF4E84
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x68347669
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0xD342B9FF
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0xA28A6E5C
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0xEB7FFC80
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0xBB705CB3
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xB351F95C

0x51EF4E84
"I know it."
0x27416B15

0x51EF4E84
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0x072B4EC5
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x8F0A71ED
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x533C2744
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x222E6265
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x39E7823C
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x7E627695
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0xAC17113F
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0xE517572E
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x10617144
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0xA71D04F5
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x75D0A78B
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0xE23EDDDC

0x51EF4E84
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0x215C125E
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0x51016D4A
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x06621118
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0xB9805A8D
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0xCE90374D

0x51EF4E84
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0x19B38BE3
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0xE0B7188E

0x51EF4E84
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0xD657C00D
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0xACA70E82
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x39B0352C
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x5E62299D
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x5E2FD997
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0xA8267332
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0x8A0A23A0
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x112188DE
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0xFA2304D0
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x6D9F93FD
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x26F19483
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x336E735B

0x51EF4E84
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0xC66E8DCB
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x0EE0D0C0
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0xAD69E30C
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x996043C9
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x120E73A0
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x97104012
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x65837096
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0x5516D5CA
own.
0xF317A6A9

0x51EF4E84
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x34D644C3
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x44447CFC
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x6CDBF8C8

0x51EF4E84
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0xCA929165
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0x94490BC2
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0xCEA8E066
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x393D08D2
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0xCD7DA953
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x231CD1D6
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x20880A5D
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x66C797BA

0x51EF4E84
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x13C19791
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0xE6F08B97
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0xFF1C8ED1
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x6B3CB4F4
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x4E534F53
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0xF6CF4A80
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0xD4BCCEAC
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xC97FD208
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0xA5FDC855

0x51EF4E84
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x9C6E15C2
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xE4D0B371
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0xD838713A
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x388EDE3E
then I felt dark indeed.
0xF133A13B

0x51EF4E84
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x4AD52936
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x2EEAD13A
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xAE5548D1
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x09B186E5
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x41185A33
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x1F39A7A7
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x8D5D4FD6
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0x49FB5F07

0x51EF4E84
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x54C4DCE1
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0xE80F77DA
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0x567DFF1E
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x7D721BEC
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x658ED0DB
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x1AE9DEC2
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x689255C3
eyes filled again.
0xADDDF1A3

0x51EF4E84
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0xFF6BB817
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xDEAE311A
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0xA942889E
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x1AC33755
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0xEFF10409
as to its cause; he only said--
0x0015BD2C

0x51EF4E84
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x166D125A
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0xB9C2E099
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x77E7095F
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x090F5FB6
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xB9960353
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xF64C41AA
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xB368BE18
said--
0xA747663A

0x51EF4E84
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0x09F91066

0x51EF4E84
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0xBFE3B2C8

0x51EF4E84
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x0009EF61
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xF23BB8D8
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x5236BCC7

0x51EF4E84
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0xDE8D76E5
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0x0E597EA0
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x37FAAE49
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0x4952CF7C
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0xF0E5F640
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xB84E00DA
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0xB8A30618
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0xC738ED45

0x51EF4E84
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x128219FA
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x7CEB204E
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xAE447F94
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xCE91FD6E
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x60FB034B
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x2DEF0A47
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0xC4C32DEC
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x8139DA9E

0x51EF4E84
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x8FE6B15C
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x57ED24E3
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x929D5A5A
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0x573005A3
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x7024DFD7
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x6EF0F448
last refuge for silence.
0x7105D79B

0x51EF4E84
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0xDC7CD35D
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x1F0033F2
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0xC4CFBE52
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0xE175C8C5
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0xB934AB03

0x51EF4E84
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0x07C6B97F
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x3A051A57
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0x06C9D494

0x51EF4E84
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xDA588D03
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x72CE8F28
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0x5B1745D3

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x39871F28
sails on the 20th of June."
0xB7C69DD9

0x51EF4E84
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x13ACB137

0x51EF4E84
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x677E9BDB
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0xE06F0E34
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0xF3279225
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0x713BC38E
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0xD46A361E
same enterprise."
0xE66BBE6E

0x51EF4E84
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0xEC12ADA5
to march with the strong."
0x8A75C3A8

0x51EF4E84
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x1BB0F57E
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0xDBD228D6

0x51EF4E84
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0x300F9A7D

0x51EF4E84
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0x4C91B18F
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x38B5341C
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0x39C7BF74
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0x8478BF7C

0x51EF4E84
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0xBCDDCD94
the first to inform them of it?"
0xDBF9AC84

0x51EF4E84
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0x5C07D611
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0xF99F5B45
rivet the spell.
0x02955E8B

0x51EF4E84
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0xDC4D7C32

0x51EF4E84
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0xCB5ACA53

0x51EF4E84
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0xDA524985
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0x78D19A62

0x51EF4E84
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0xDC5BA709
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0xA12A7B36
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x12442A42
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0xD44E4668

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0x707C7643

0x51EF4E84
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x96B34AB5
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0x21295A77

0x51EF4E84
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0xACBDDD70
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0xF508D9CA
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x816ED7D6
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0xF0310AC1
service."
0x54CE0827

0x51EF4E84
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0x3F25C259

0x51EF4E84
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0xA8A71DDC
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0x020492A4
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0xCC6DE472
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x9A64B2A1
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x5F1B95C9
for him.
0x8B67B0A4

0x51EF4E84
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x4783EE62
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x08FE20F2
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x69048F6B
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x717B3ED1
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0xA6E445DF
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x1FB7A09A
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x5922061A
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0xD2AC5785
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0x74212E8C
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0x54F56A1E
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0xA644ADD7

0x51EF4E84
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0x97F49146
labours."
0xB80CCE55

0x51EF4E84
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0xA4528D8B
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x173F42CD
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0xB16AB3A3
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0x1551DB49

0x51EF4E84
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0xFF9C268D
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0x478DBEAE
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0xDB1DC0A5
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0x90FE46C1
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0x3CE3AF85
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0xC1F27826

0x51EF4E84
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0x605C89F8
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x1F34B1C1
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x13652E64
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0xA4B42EFD
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x89ADCCEC
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0xBE337DB1
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0x85B48787
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0xE18FB165
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x8D836D8D
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x29724CF0
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xCCF4F46F
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0xFE615509
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0x8C99E527
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0x54612C08
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x932CB5E5
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0x5085EC8D
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xF2B69E1F
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0xB294774B
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x664F49B2
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0x6A34DE7B
be to me invaluable."
0xB5E7E657

0x51EF4E84
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x3B24D825
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x93EA638A
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x00B235D4
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0x3B4E6A7F
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0xCF13799B
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0xFE7E1C1C
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0xAA690298

0x51EF4E84
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0xC4A4996F
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0x76656A14

0x51EF4E84
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:
0x126CB88C

0x58E5C105

0x51EF4E84
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0xF25B2208
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0xEA194664
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0xB69965C5
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x109C65A0
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x699BABCE
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x134986F3
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0xED80F62B
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x15190DA9
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x51DAE426
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x904D6C0C
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0x209737F6
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0xEEBC51D1
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0xA92B412E
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x057BB4FF
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xBD0F2BB4
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0xFFCF495B
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x73E0AEA8
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x89C3C44D
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x1FED7AEB
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x5AD84808
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0xD089DAFC
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0xB77C4220
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xAD006BDA
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0xE7A3F437
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0xC7E75EE1
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0xB44CE30A

0x51EF4E84
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0x37CE95B7
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x78E486EA
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0xA823A4FB
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x41768634
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0xAC8E6004
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x4750712E
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xDEEDE380
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0xC8EF814F
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0x04380AFD
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0xFCA98EF8
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x4CDA2A13
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xF269E3B7
I will tell him so."
0xDBA9F8D9

0x51EF4E84
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x4F835896
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x968B8014
his feet and approached me.
0x9201D7E1

0x51EF4E84
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0x63C09CFE

0x51EF4E84
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0xFE70BEDF

0x51EF4E84
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0x87F4172B
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0xAA92FDFD

0x51EF4E84
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x15969A7E
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x9C88EF25
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x52211581
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x00A71865
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x48587584
sense will guide you."
0x4E8ED73F

0x51EF4E84
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0xFB03D9D3
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x8A47E69B
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0x27559740
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0x5B60F449
continue."
0x69937EBA

0x51EF4E84
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0x22677C8C
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0x84E240AD
have said that."
0x027F18F3

0x51EF4E84
"Conditionally."
0xE4797189

0x51EF4E84
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0x83F7660C
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0x0DD8F135
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0x3D8A0BBE
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0x3BF15B37
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x697D6D28
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0x50782AA7
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x1E6B489E
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x6E1DD95B
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x4BDDDE94
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0xC148A0B3
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0xFA809389

0x51EF4E84
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x84C7617F
my limbs.
0xBEE50B75

0x51EF4E84
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0x076F0CF9

0x51EF4E84
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0x67453352
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0xCAA23DB3
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0xCBAD3F19

0x51EF4E84
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0xFF9F9416
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0xCC02919F
them he has no use: I retain them."
0x288C84AC

0x51EF4E84
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0xE3FD28CC
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x70A9D4EC
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x79EA3329
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0xB3249946

0x51EF4E84
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0xB7B41A14

0x51EF4E84
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0x89A1B9FB
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x42438724
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x1F3156C6
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x1956A6D7
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0xD957E8EC
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x476809C3
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0xA6007ADB
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x6FE9084D
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x986DB387
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x6ABE0FE9
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0xE30E3558
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0xA2798ABF
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0x7DF45E42

0x51EF4E84
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x4B7F8511
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x82C8E99F

0x51EF4E84
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x46EC0EBC
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x1FD30592
this signify?"
0xB9E58537

0x51EF4E84
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0x05B873F3
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x8AD56A90
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x0EB50817
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x98D02ADB
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x5D2E9517
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0xC15EC67F
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x6D3B2DC5
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x63297741
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0xD90FEAC4
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x283BC404
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x481AFDEE
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xEED08138
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0xA08A4494

0x51EF4E84
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x12DB193F
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x2EA9325A
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xBCE24A82
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x27718079
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0x6D98264A
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x289C7E1E
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0xD3A9FACE
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x3DEBD89D
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0xF3711A81
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x980B43A7
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x2716BF2A
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xA99B0A48
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x8680537C
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x68618F42
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x7059787C
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0xA87D072F
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0xDB79AE38
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x1F6C9B89
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0x380E3A05
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x07B2007B
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0xD93CC7C0
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0xD629F965

0x51EF4E84
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x9EEF4AB9

0x51EF4E84
"Well?" he answered icily.
0xDE76683B

0x51EF4E84
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0xD65C227D
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0x9643D31C

0x51EF4E84
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0x848C8EEA
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x920C8F13
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x3DC171AC
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x56BC5B6A
tribes--and unwed?"
0xA905DCE4

0x51EF4E84
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xCE766EB4
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x298D1116
yourself."
0xD64F91A6

0x51EF4E84
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x7DFE8DD6
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x030D0C02
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x0BC23D5B
heart and--it would not do."
0x2339D826

0x51EF4E84
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0x9CB85CCB
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0x6A35E681
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x23887B3D
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x582EC53C
nothing more--don't fear."
0x17B5890C

0x51EF4E84
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x97915A34
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x78691DD8
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x7F834953
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0x35CA640D
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0x95380068
eyes."
0x5943B314

0x51EF4E84
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x7A5A425D
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x1569090E
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0xB3BF3FC7
offer it."
0xAB208F72

0x51EF4E84
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0xB0D455BC
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x769FF857
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0xB81F34E3

0x51EF4E84
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x6171F42C
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0xD6B6131F

0x51EF4E84
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x0D1D40C2

0x51EF4E84
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0x6BFEC105
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x65317CCF
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0x5CC2ECB2
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x01ACD6CE
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0xA4582F10
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0xD5884F70

0x51EF4E84
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0x19993963
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x03D3A3BB
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0xCC15FBB9
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xFDE5373A
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x6F59566B
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x782BBB66
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x6641ED04
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xCE4F1B01
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xA8A0177D
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xD3E2452C

0x51EF4E84
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x63C3C8A6

0x51EF4E84
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x5451D297

0x51EF4E84
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x6CA463B8
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0x58B92D7D
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x99F4BF91
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x679D2699
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0x976BE70C
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xB4DD7AFF
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0xC2515F74
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0xA4FC33D1
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0x94169C9B

0x51EF4E84
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0x1400B00E
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x51D57498
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x4DAA6F92
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xE49E3012

0x51EF4E84
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0xD9379DC5
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x00DA1876
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xB30D6B93

0x51EF4E84
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0xEB8A7EB1
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0xB561D223
stairs.
0xFA3E0B19

0x51EF4E84
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0xA04EBF04

0x51EF4E84
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x82B95AAF

0x51EF4E84
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x12EE38D0

0x51EF4E84
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x9576933F
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x701D99D7
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x305B7597
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0xE796D004
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xE4B05C52
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0xF887E63F
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0xB3D1B339

0x51EF4E84
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0x3B43D7A6
down.
0x7AC814C2

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXV
0x56990AE4

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xF21896E9
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0x97DD1B5E
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x5C1BE25E
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0xAF8D3C8C
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x8B6DABD2
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x379ECFE2

0x51EF4E84
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0xC88D2AFC
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0xC0BA785F
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x746A8A8A
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x6CDB0F2B
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x899172DD
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x116B53E9
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x4EA3A5FC
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x455B1D41
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0xDB01497A

0x51EF4E84
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0xA8E12C80
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x6FF06D94
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x97CDB53D
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x5BB4A00B
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0xB454026F
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0xEE7E486D
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x6245E56E
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0x1AF49823
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x152E37D5

0x51EF4E84
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x453A9EE9
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xB2857925
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0xB31CF2C8
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x73B851B5
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x5A7C0349
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x0701F71C
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x26BD9838
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0x3C865CF7
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x8DDFA6BA
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x765CE906
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x71DDB32F
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0xF70B5551
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x5CAA9406
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x883F9802
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x57815A5C

0x51EF4E84
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0xDABF034A
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x1D97B9F6
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0xCFBCE8FA
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0x296D813E
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x606D6F34
spoke to the point at once.
0x8CACB553

0x51EF4E84
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x12106736
friends."
0xE4904F8E

0x51EF4E84
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0xAC169F98
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x698AC6C4

0x51EF4E84
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x4902DDB8

0x51EF4E84
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x3F6B5AF9
good."
0x93D0D630

0x51EF4E84
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0xECB0CD01
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0xFF3275FC
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0xFBAE1DAD
strangers."
0xB70859D9

0x51EF4E84
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x66749135
regarding you as a stranger."
0x933D639D

0x51EF4E84
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0xAF0175E6
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0xFF3A2F79
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x931E2B5C
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0xAC678F4D
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0xBE746011
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x12DF8E2E

0x51EF4E84
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0xA9856842
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0x69B9303A

0x51EF4E84
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0xADEC2B68

0x51EF4E84
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0xF7368EEB
India?"
0xEB221E98

0x51EF4E84
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xFA50E4A0

0x51EF4E84
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x33B309BA

0x51EF4E84
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x8DD8ACC7
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0xE92B4535
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x7FF1DED4

0x51EF4E84
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x4CB85243

0x51EF4E84
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x3E970C92
crash down.
0x41786D60

0x51EF4E84
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0xDAD70DF2

0x51EF4E84
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x833720FD
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xEEDD7A9D
You are killing me now."
0x9D91E24D

0x51EF4E84
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x7FF79BDD

0x51EF4E84
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0xA6A5CFBE
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0xBF79F616
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0xE27FD0B8
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x088ABF04
until seventy-and-seven times."
0x647C4426

0x51EF4E84
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0xB63EAAB9
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x13920BBA
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0x4F2EC851

0x51EF4E84
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0x286DB7FB
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0xFE32CD69

0x51EF4E84
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0x739DA7E1
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0x046DEEF9
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x71AFD15A

0x51EF4E84
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0x3071B43E
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0xE02AB485

0x51EF4E84
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0xAA56B1DE
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x0EE01F5B
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0x16A236C1

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x778621EA

0x51EF4E84
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x043335F2
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x541482C6
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x2377248A
spoke at last.
0xB7E78843

0x51EF4E84
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xE11865BD
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x0D601EB1
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x94868A43
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0xACA784E8
sake."
0x0CC6AE86

0x51EF4E84
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x51A0B371
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0xE2709069
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x07C54468
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x89E46AFF
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x041C94EB
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x54C7B25F

0x51EF4E84
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0xDAAAFB26
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x0D2C14B8

0x51EF4E84
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0xBB230BA1
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0xF7A182D7
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x59104A7C
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0xD202F848
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0xF16367D4
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0x9036E2FB

0x51EF4E84
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0x678896D3
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x07B0A38F
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0xE3728E18

0x51EF4E84
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0x72132389
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0xAF8A60E2
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x1DD5BB69
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x09DBF5E6
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xBE240D59

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x0BD3AEA7

0x51EF4E84
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x1849A732
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0x08577DFB
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0xF5204BBB
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0x0D3A62C0
leaving it."
0x24DF61F2

0x51EF4E84
"What do you mean?"
0x554E86BB

0x51EF4E84
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0xA5A59014
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x19109E80
some means that doubt is removed."
0xDC447640

0x51EF4E84
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x43A0155A
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0xA226C586
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0x643315EE
Rochester?"
0x4A8FD8F5

0x51EF4E84
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xB29D3D2B

0x51EF4E84
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x0794A65A

0x51EF4E84
"I must find out what is become of him."
0x54C1F6FA

0x51EF4E84
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0xA599F3DA
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0x9BCCCF06
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x22552A07
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0xD7B1387B

0x51EF4E84
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0x14AF7C52
was soon out of sight.
0x39A4AAA5

0x51EF4E84
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xDAF35E69
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x9F042668
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x7F490947

0x51EF4E84
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0x594F1F9C
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x88204275
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0xC6153021
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x8B518566
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0xFFC52803

0x51EF4E84
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xFCE731FD

0x51EF4E84
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x527D409B
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x7EEADBB0
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0xCF9774F5
Jane?"
0xBC06A339

0x51EF4E84
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x547951FE

0x51EF4E84
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0xBC8C8852
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0x783CCA5C
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x9569CA6D

0x51EF4E84
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x3F206999

0x51EF4E84
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0xC5AFAF71
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x2A96B8C5

0x51EF4E84
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0x581C8C61
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0xE080FC43

0x51EF4E84
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x6D69C1DD

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x7AA98A34
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x2A35013F

0x51EF4E84
"I have refused to marry him--"
0xF5B2E66A

0x51EF4E84
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x4B8A0A1F

0x51EF4E84
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x845A14A1
as his sister."
0x4AC996BC

0x51EF4E84
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x0BE0DC2C
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x356541E4
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0x76425CEC
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0x316AE029
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x63432F49
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0xAA862789
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0xA6FA7955

0x51EF4E84
"Not as a husband."
0xD9B23B60

0x51EF4E84
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0x7117B44F

0x51EF4E84
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x031330D7

0x51EF4E84
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x914B8734
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0xB60EB532
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x217F7FA2

0x51EF4E84
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0x4BA65BE5
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0xE8E46CCE
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0xEB3B27AA
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x34A43230
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xB708BD8B

0x51EF4E84
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0xADFD6DEC

0x51EF4E84
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0xB2B1C459
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x4BB087C9
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0x468E8274
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x53C20CD0
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0xE8FA4F4B
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0xD443134E

0x51EF4E84
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xA991B91D

0x51EF4E84
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x7E765291
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0xC00E478A
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0xE62D07B0
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x0075E1C9
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x9C939003
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0xDFA0C7F9
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xEA6BDCAA
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x580AD576

0x51EF4E84
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x35B209C6

0x51EF4E84
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x33414FED
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0xC749B1B6
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x8FDEFB19
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0xAE414E03
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x11017BE5

0x51EF4E84
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x3B213605
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x62297DDE
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x62806C18
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x20532B93
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x590878AE
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0x959337EF
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x6115062A
had forgiven me once more.
0x7D7449C7

0x51EF4E84
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x62CBB725
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0x12CF1F6D
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x99870287
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0xF3E6DB79
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0xD37BEE6D
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x320159BB
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x16F5B365
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x379579A1
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x5FCCB52F
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xA9D584DA
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x4D5D33D8
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x4B6D317C
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0xFCCCC622
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x21F830B8

0x51EF4E84
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x9A5E1F60
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0x3CE91532
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x7FDF00F4

0x51EF4E84
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x7AE46F7B
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x4D092463
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x2D03FD55
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x6F86AAC5

0x51EF4E84
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0x6D14C375

0x51EF4E84
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0x87D7DCF8
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x0BDDBF77
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x9705550F
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0x130A8E1F
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x6BDB33B8
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x1C4E30F9
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xD7DCDDA6

0x51EF4E84
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0x63D4C060
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x810561FB
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0xA0CAA16D
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x435B2318
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0xF8DBFA62
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x98E606E9
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x753DE286
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0x3759762F
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x90B34100
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0xCCC6FF00
could not but feel it too.
0x57C54F53

0x51EF4E84
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0xA96AF284
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x3B676A04
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0x765B5A8A
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0x1B037EA9

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x2EE7BF08
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x678BBFC9
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x674DB1AF
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0xF43CBDE7
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x6B235FCF
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x9F02615A
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x1E533751
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x294A49DF
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x06133C29
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xBBE2CD6B
from you!"
0x320DC3D3

0x51EF4E84
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0xB3C21B51
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0xA38523E4
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x6D308002
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x64B54450
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0xAB6449C2
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x65EC192C
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xAC4BC501
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x5C371939
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x1C2757F9
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x2F1B551A
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0x114CCBDC
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0xDA5A9C3F
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x9CC18B16
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x91B99D1E
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x660921A1
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0xD3425D99

0x51EF4E84
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0x2B121B2D
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x898E8C98
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x7651A248
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0xC47EC576
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0xF4CC0415
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0x89C36ED0
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x25C604E7
dim room was full of visions.
0xDE28D0FB

0x51EF4E84
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0xA31ABCA8
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0xF6DC8260
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x746B306D
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0xC113AE37
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x689E1096
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xD6A9E4DA
prayer: it was only elevated.
0xAC110F94

0x51EF4E84
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0xEE5A3AC5
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x46F0D4F2
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0x64D21A98

0x51EF4E84
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0xE83B0D4D
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x3A5A877A
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0xD5BF52F3
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x814DEC3A
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x134E9FC4
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0xB133F915
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0xB06CAC1B
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x4CC98AB7
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x233BEB34
shall judge.
0x1973CBA9

0x51EF4E84
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x1EB05787
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x80C7DF43
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xF5ADBACF
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x278D4BC9
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0xA221AFEB
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x575EE9E6
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x758C724B
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0xE7486F1E
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x05A03656
bones.
0x4055FF4F

0x51EF4E84
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x6C5B91B6
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0xAF0EF2BA

0x51EF4E84
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x4B3FB729

0x51EF4E84
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0x5DE7C325

0x51EF4E84
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x10D42911
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x20C8E4E0
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x268193A9
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xD3A991BC
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x70B38FC8
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x2D244DD2

0x51EF4E84
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x26276C48
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x4D219185
garden: it was void.
0xE2F5E931

0x51EF4E84
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x4AB3E077

0x51EF4E84
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x4CFB7E63
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0x5707FE1A
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x56D916D7

0x51EF4E84
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0x1290B49D
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xACE5AE07
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0xBD371359
best."
0xF1E53786

0x51EF4E84
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0xD1FB8A7A
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0x1C77DAFA
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x9C7F5B37
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x635E8E85
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0xE6828933
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0x61BABA5D
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0xFF7B27EE
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0x058849E2
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x988FFDA8
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

CHAPTER XXXVI
0x06A65E5F

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0x0A8CB3FE
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x91BA90E6
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x8114C4DE
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0xAD3C1F97
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0x29244D2A
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x522BE39B

0x51EF4E84
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x9E390924
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0x60A13AB3
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x946A5B84
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x0A7F2AD8
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x4491CA73
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x61E2B564

0x51EF4E84
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0xD0EEF346
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x9590DD2E
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xA2238542
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x40D2BBA9
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xA0BEA28B

0x51EF4E84
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0x11B69EA8
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0xC87EBB52
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0xDD66E1E3
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x7349FFA6
would meet the coach.
0x727DA637

0x51EF4E84
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0xF3C1E174
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0x8A19B78C
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0xDE95BA65

0x51EF4E84
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x83D1AE47
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0xA79502B9
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0xCCC5B17A
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0xCDA08260
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x48B0C8E2
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0xFD9E2352
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0xEF041FD3
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x6BCA6035
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0x4D99E5D9
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x39C91417
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0xFEFBAABC
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x574C9907
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x45F748FF
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0xAFFB20EF
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0xFB84E33D
body.
0x194A059A

0x51EF4E84
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0xE78A81B0
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x59912938
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x1850B7E9

0x51EF4E84
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x34B4EEB7
and should be absent at least four days.
0xE07E60D4

0x51EF4E84
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x0064C8D7

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x1089E797
time been uneasy."
0xB45B6EB5

0x51EF4E84
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x7777A17B
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0xFDF7A469
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x312F329C
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xB25A6A50
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0xE6AACA20
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x56CE34D2

0x51EF4E84
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x1CE4F388
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0xB68B3476
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x01D440B6
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x0E9A9273
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x484A0348

0x51EF4E84
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x178E0112
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x0405A50C
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x97FB5955
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0xB5870616
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0xDF78C0AB
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x7962A5E1
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0xE88125D9
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x0C0DFF64
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0xCDD352C3

0x51EF4E84
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xE49DB850
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x68A1F6CB
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0x25FD36F6
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0xFA85D82A
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xA70E8D0B
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x25E6E0C6
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x864CA290
we were near my bourne.
0x6C9ABB64

0x51EF4E84
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0x6892CE62

0x51EF4E84
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x828E37BA

0x51EF4E84
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0xA5C480E4
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x98C76424
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0xB7516C8E
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x4B5375DF
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x4573A9A8
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0xD4D03610

0x51EF4E84
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x4A8DD11C
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0xA69B2B33
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x1969F757
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x800BE43F
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x6F99E669
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xE7BEA04D
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0x9EDE6BD6
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x67090E23

0x51EF4E84
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0xF01F23BC
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xE49A3125
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x1CEC1A22
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xDAC5966A
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x854E223B
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xCEF636A5
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0xFE73CFBE
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x8CE32861
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x4A5924D3
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x7352B9DD
them!
0x1E14B41B

0x51EF4E84
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0xC8531F39
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x329C49FE
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x4FD23139
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x72ED5208
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xDDC2C263
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0xF3C8D8BA
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x42BFBB58
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x0EFAC132
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0xA4A8A858
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x6D75AE49
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0xD45D1340
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x50C01ADD
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0x2D687ED5
tideless sea of the south."
0xEC2A3948

0x51EF4E84
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x907DBB31
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x83AD7BDA
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x17218422
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x5AABE35E
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x787B3AC2
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0xE9FDBAA5
station were at my command.
0x92DCA771

0x51EF4E84
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xDF90FB51
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x436E7A0F
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x718488F4
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0xED7BC355
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x947D0E0F
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xA7A3E9A8
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x895AD55F
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0xFD11B72D

0x51EF4E84
Hear an illustration, reader.
0xD7D4864A

0x51EF4E84
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x115DDBF7
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0x36D08720
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x41DD4E31
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xDECA39D1
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0xD7BED0DD
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x35DE296B
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x05E840BC
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0xDF09FFC9
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0xB7DDB73F
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0x35606776
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x611D0F8E
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x2202146B
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0xC573F73D

0x51EF4E84
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xAF336DE5
ruin.
0x0ED5B3C7

0x51EF4E84
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x6570DEF4
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0xBDFC7F13
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x83D56C7A
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x9C9809B1
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x9F711292
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x05FEBEAF
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x92C799E4

0x51EF4E84
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x31E03B09
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x9640A1D0
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0xB75EBC17
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x8DE4DABF
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0x3B3BC733
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0xB4282427
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0xAC1DAEAD
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0xE27FBD1B
token.
0x9841E5CF

0x51EF4E84
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x0C0DE516
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x738E399C
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x65C87A58
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0xA029606D
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0xD5DF8EE9
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x1CC8CFFD
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x60F594C0
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x4695E8E9
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0xA47B4EF5
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x4AECD1F6

0x51EF4E84
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0xCBEDE631
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x70FBFF45
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0x56D2DA1E
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0xDCD56726
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0xDF0D2766
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x95924D9C
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0xF55735CD

0x51EF4E84
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x37652279

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0xF11AB786

0x51EF4E84
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0x3EC68358

0x51EF4E84
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0xC5AE4E7B

0x51EF4E84
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x6E8C7864
trying to evade.
0xB1A2DDC3

0x51EF4E84
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0x654F280A

0x51EF4E84
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xCB3CC360
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x6D500F46
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0xF393A139
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x3EA9365C
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x8166952F
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xA5F375C2
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0xA3C01CD6
Antipodes.
0x07D38F19

0x51EF4E84
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0xE67A6932
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x71D7CDAB
direct question as to where he really was.
0x0CF62AF8

0x51EF4E84
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x6D0A4606
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x8CBACF29
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x9876C319
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0x639869DC
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xC5D84DBE
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0xDA15E584
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x6B52E14A
witnessed it myself."
0x074E63E8

0x51EF4E84
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x41ECC7BC
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x80F91A2A

0x51EF4E84
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0xE8576782
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x3FC04784
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x872377AF
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0xFAF2993F

0x51EF4E84
"I have heard something of it."
0x237DBC61

0x51EF4E84
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x02B1B4B1
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x5B9E7DD9
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0x73FC1DBF
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x86A34283
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xCD11E24A
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0x168F66AA

0x51EF4E84
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x83810FA6
main fact.
0x5750E4D1

0x51EF4E84
"And this lady?"
0x0985DAB6

0x51EF4E84
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0x580CAD2E
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0x6C594C4A
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0xF760C58F

0x51EF4E84
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x41D01958

0x51EF4E84
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0xB6967493
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0xE868BBAB
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0xF8C51A31
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xE3ABA69D
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x2221C508
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0xBDAE86E8
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0xB5B80149
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0xD9C79D45
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0x7F57B878
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x717CC5AC

0x51EF4E84
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xA5570800
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0xEC1815A8
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xD98E710C

0x51EF4E84
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x3A101EFD
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x8612B104
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0xA845E833
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0xF01D08F9
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x1A482B64
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x4B5EC31F
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0xB96122FE
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x925EFDB2
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x4E75D0D7
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x101D713E
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xB28F3B96
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xB692D9D4
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0xB3F97C2F
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0x282F7F86
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0xE7374DA8
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x9FA94494
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x0C111F0F
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0xED6F1D61
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x64F7491D
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x784CE301
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0xD68C535B
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x7C975182
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0xFFE69A72
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0xD8199E05
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xDA4DA484
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0xC10E375B

0x51EF4E84
"What! did he not leave England?"
0xF51AD905

0x51EF4E84
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x87134A2F
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xC295884C
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x346F3B81
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0x607895C7
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x9B4C49C5
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x82315576
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0xADC6E8D1
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0xB1D96710
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xDBB10B3A
Thornfield Hall."
0xE584D04F

0x51EF4E84
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xBCA2551B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x092E5D2E
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x61FFD8A2
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xC821287B
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x28A452AD
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x0052C931
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0xDB0598E4
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0xC542488B
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0xDC7804BD
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0xF383BF79
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x1D1A9439
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0xBB8D9020
pavement."
0x4C7B34C0

0x51EF4E84
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0x284F624E

0x51EF4E84
"Dead?"
0x9F549A96

0x51EF4E84
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0xEC402074
scattered."
0x42FEE749

0x51EF4E84
"Good God!"
0xE3C461C6

0x51EF4E84
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0x6BA7A8DB

0x51EF4E84
He shuddered.
0xED8AD4C4

0x51EF4E84
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0x837CBDFE

0x51EF4E84
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0x5BA45BB7
only some bits of walls standing now."
0xBBD59831

0x51EF4E84
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x60555D80

0x51EF4E84
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0x161D86B1

0x51EF4E84
"What do you mean?"
0x554E86BB

0x51EF4E84
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0xA9447F0B
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0x778F9A85
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x0B554F20
pity him, for my part."
0x1B5DAC45

0x51EF4E84
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0x6E3EF6DB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x7483E96A

0x51EF4E84
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0x14B89F2F
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x3B3F40BD

0x51EF4E84
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0xC5B2856F
fixture now."
0xC076C0A8

0x51EF4E84
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0xA59E9CEB

0x51EF4E84
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0x1785B1A3
Edward."
0xEC494232

0x51EF4E84
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0xB978209D
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x2220B9FF

0x51EF4E84
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0xD915DCC8
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x0ECBDB50
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0xDC3225D7
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x981A7676
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0xC227E725
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x5DC1EF9E
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x0B5CCFCD
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x2EBB471D
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0xDE4F1E32

0x51EF4E84
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0x990A8EC5

0x51EF4E84
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0x08694EEF
quite a desolate spot."
0x7889C587

0x51EF4E84
"Who is with him?"
0x0704DDF6

0x51EF4E84
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0xF3F63C38
down, they say."
0x3304A9DF

0x51EF4E84
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x5347513F

0x51EF4E84
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0x6675E6F1

0x51EF4E84
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0x02DF4FC5
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0x86A0F1B2
you usually demand."
0x09089A21

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXVII
0x96F0703A

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x55BB475C
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0x4EE54154
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x73435851
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0xC43FB5F6
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x7EA726C7
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0xEBB8154D
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x878BAE23
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x46C0EECB
there in the season to shoot.
0xF85FD121

0x51EF4E84
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0xAB3637D0
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x4D47C0B0
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x7EB903D5
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0xC269E77B
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0x67441AB0
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x746CF4D6
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x6BFD34AA
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0xAF9AED8E
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0xE80A2A81
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0x36FEB90E
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xA6AC6231
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0xDF83D1CB

0x51EF4E84
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x20A991D9
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x52983AF7
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0xD27BE5EA
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x6E7C41E3

0x51EF4E84
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0xA0D4DFD3
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0x365D201B
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0xC1277AAF
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0xFE5B68E2
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0xDD541456
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x7D79F7E5
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0xD80E6B5B
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x45AA73B1
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0x4AC9D81A
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x9595B86B
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0xD72C41F6
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0xC41D6168

0x51EF4E84
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xECACD6B6

0x51EF4E84
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0xB179C08C
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0x4BD8DB33
grange.
0xC54D24CC

0x51EF4E84
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0xCC6979C0
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x456C09FD
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0xB0B9C572
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x15D110FE

0x51EF4E84
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0x0197483B
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x2589FF11
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x6025BBDE
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x9DE362CB
advance.
0xB41FCA91

0x51EF4E84
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xBA621A86
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x10100C69
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0x73DD3882
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0xA87C6718
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x72D0DB12
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0xB5A7E4E6
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x4E5BC52D
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0xC61564F8

0x51EF4E84
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x624B9A6A
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x60E75157
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0xF44D4943
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0xF6746D91

0x51EF4E84
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0x7C213001
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0xA10A163B
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xFCF74C26
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0xAC9CFD55
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x746B2509
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0xB5AD50D6
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0xF87EB5A1
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x33CFFC11
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x662CE2A4
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0xC9DA4938
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x8527F48F

0x51EF4E84
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xEAA95EFA
had you not better go in?"
0x8FCC268F

0x51EF4E84
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0xAE01EF04

0x51EF4E84
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0xC57E9659
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0xCFF8D09D
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0x08594323

0x51EF4E84
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x06554B18
"how are you?"
0xBA158C9E

0x51EF4E84
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x68E925CF
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0xF44EB4D3
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x9BD577C5
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0xE51ECBCD
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x7B217C34
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0xE0AE8E3B
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x70C8927F
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x5CF4E42E
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0xFB45B899
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x7AA24847
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0x6B01D698
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0xB781A7EB

0x51EF4E84
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0x9233EA56
to him, but do not give my name."
0x7A94F333

0x51EF4E84
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0x40AD22B0

0x51EF4E84
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x333167EF
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x69E0F115
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x05DBC186

0x51EF4E84
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xFF176028

0x51EF4E84
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x34DE49E8

0x51EF4E84
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0x4BA31634

0x51EF4E84
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0xF9DC9693
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0xD2421EE9
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0xC01E3018

0x51EF4E84
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0xE43CE326
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x1FB798CD
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0xF02CD901
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0xAA82F103
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x0D972884
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x38A5985E
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x3CC15E1C
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x141CB5A0
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x533D8A71
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x6F9B2CB3

0x51EF4E84
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0x39951941

0x51EF4E84
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x0EA7756B
still excited.
0xAF5E2368

0x51EF4E84
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0xC35912B8

0x51EF4E84
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x72A61637
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x25575CFF
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x100FEA46

0x51EF4E84
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x5B182322

0x51EF4E84
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x821B2C74
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x6100548D
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0xF5763CAB
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x82A294F7
and aloud.
0xE51D27AC

0x51EF4E84
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0xB101F5E4
glass," I said.
0x38907B91

0x51EF4E84
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0xE484479E

0x51EF4E84
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x73550E90
evening," I answered.
0x0CC7DFCF

0x51EF4E84
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x1AED3CCD
seized me?"
0xE305AB32

0x51EF4E84
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x7AA84D0C
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x107DF6DD

0x51EF4E84
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x159114ED
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0xBAAE3B7F
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0xA69A98FA

0x51EF4E84
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x21AB23BD

0x51EF4E84
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0xCBED2BC8
must be more of her."
0x9889113B

0x51EF4E84
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xC5174F01
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0xDC0C0957

0x51EF4E84
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x0AEC306D

0x51EF4E84
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x589759BC
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0xDC628A8E

0x51EF4E84
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x27C82B94

0x51EF4E84
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xDF076155
come back to you."
0xEE41EB6E

0x51EF4E84
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0x2140D3F4

0x51EF4E84
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0xE0176EC6
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x0DE3A189

0x51EF4E84
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x8238E74F
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x1FE6FD32
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0x8DE3E058
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x7BE94A2A
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0xDA17D77B

0x51EF4E84
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x00FA655B

0x51EF4E84
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x4742150A
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x6A2DCE76
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0xDA68A6CF
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xA2421D16
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x57992128
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0x9BE5CB02

0x51EF4E84
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x945044E3

0x51EF4E84
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0xF9E3BBE1
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xDB55FA86
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x24FB9F68

0x51EF4E84
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0xACE74E2A

0x51EF4E84
"I am."
0xCB35359A

0x51EF4E84
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0x6F6E7615
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x23797B7B

0x51EF4E84
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0x0AAD469D

0x51EF4E84
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x1ED0617B

0x51EF4E84
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0xC3A3851D

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0x5D52DCFB
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0x296061F8
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x2F4AE38C
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x13D75804

0x51EF4E84
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0x2F2C8D5E
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0x72A766C3
company of an evening."
0x3959C6DA

0x51EF4E84
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0x6ECBD92A
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0x50C334E3
me?"
0x0F923AE0

0x51EF4E84
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x45C4BCA6
mistress."
0x1C52BF5A

0x51EF4E84
"And you will stay with me?"
0x5280B38D

0x51EF4E84
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x6B062FE0
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0x210D9EDE
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0x41CE1AA6
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x045C7AB9
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x997D1B97

0x51EF4E84
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0x6FAC9D2D
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xFC61A76A
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0x7E3F2C4B
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x7E5DEE19
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x8B53E8B5
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xF2E8A82E
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0xDF930735
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x9367174F
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x6A4D14C8
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x55546187
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0xD5694C35

0x51EF4E84
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0xFAD2D338
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0xDB4900C2
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x196DD749
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0xBBFBC4B4
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x1949C6B6
vengeance on its frame."
0xB0AECA1E

0x51EF4E84
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0x62C3B29D

0x51EF4E84
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0xF74CD1B8
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x49E47BCD
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x80D69BF2
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x722B06B4
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0xFB0D784D
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0x1D2B3E4F
Come--tell me."
0x9C129EB7

0x51EF4E84
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x01F72738
you think it better."
0x2ACFFAE2

0x51EF4E84
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0xAE0D7DA5
one day."
0xABEEB7A5

0x51EF4E84
"I don't care about being married."
0x58B37C22

0x51EF4E84
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0x32E7D47F
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0xBF464E99

0x51EF4E84
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x02633C1E
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0x2D83D09D
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0xC93DD8AB
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x8E74EA33
conversation.
0x4BA6F462

0x51EF4E84
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xEBB28BD1
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x5182F3D7
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0xFB09ACEF
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0x8DD19D1E
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0xFA43D8BD
not yet noticed."
0xCE49BDE3

0x51EF4E84
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x2457556E
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xE33A72A2
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x908A754A

0x51EF4E84
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x1847E961
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x47C6A64B
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xD0537B09

0x51EF4E84
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x89DFB2FC
cicatrised visage."
0xF547515C

0x51EF4E84
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x380A5E4B
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x861CFBA4
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xBDCCAE45

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x73527443

0x51EF4E84
"And you see the candles?"
0x4CC78082

0x51EF4E84
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xAA2A1A57

0x51EF4E84
"Can you see me?"
0xBBB5DEA1

0x51EF4E84
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0x3B6E15E6

0x51EF4E84
"When do you take supper?"
0xAD742469

0x51EF4E84
"I never take supper."
0xAB16448C

0x51EF4E84
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0xFDB58100
only you forget."
0xD2C9414F

0x51EF4E84
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x907507A3
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xD266EDCD
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x6BA3053A
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0xAF1A65AD
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xC1B86762
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x0749FD62
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0x97A0F2D2
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x88E377B1
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0x1097F997
lineaments softened and warmed.
0x5BDF0E88

0x51EF4E84
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x8F9E07A1
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0xCC16D2AA
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x09428040
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x5C16E76C
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0xF18C1057
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0xF0E95D7D
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0xB250EF0D

0x51EF4E84
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0x165B9802

0x51EF4E84
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0xF45921A7
p422.jpg}
0xA7E8D56D

0x51EF4E84
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0x9C3420C5

0x51EF4E84
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0xCA7E5443
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0x0C1CE2E8
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x38313B52
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x30591169

0x51EF4E84
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0x4385A135

0x51EF4E84
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0xFC813C8C
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x9679DB9C
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x229D8D68
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0xE40DF532
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x57916E76
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xBB5A7E11
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0xE48EDE0D
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x16C35F9A
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0xC76D0297

0x51EF4E84
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0xE2D62B61
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0xA022D575
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0x3320A4A6
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0xC7C2E16D
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0x13B7DEC5

0x51EF4E84
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0xBEDF56F5
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0x45BF472B
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0xDDC111E5
undiscoverable?
0x9098CE32

0x51EF4E84
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0x9F092519

0x51EF4E84
"What for, Jane?"
0xFCCA46CF

0x51EF4E84
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0x0D91F2C2
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x78126D9B
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x2538A85B

0x51EF4E84
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0x406BE62D

0x51EF4E84
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x9DA87D08

0x51EF4E84
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0x4657C5B6
sojourned."
0x87189004

0x51EF4E84
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0xA8E5AF48
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0xB6DFC8E1
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0xD7030C79

0x51EF4E84
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0xA7602CCE

0x51EF4E84
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0x72282F13
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0xAEAB6A28
substantiality."
0x8275FD03

0x51EF4E84
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x1BE11BDA

0x51EF4E84
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xC9A22CFA
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0xB03B8EF7
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x344CEE67
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0xFA3069DB
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0xA6DDE44C
ham."
0x25873F75

0x51EF4E84
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0xAC1BA25D
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0x4123D32A
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0x7B583AC7
harp."
0x6A691938

0x51EF4E84
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x2126DF4E
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xE2E7FE05
night."
0x07C8914C

0x51EF4E84
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x945EFBDC
been?"
0xB4E6114F

0x51EF4E84
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0xA41F9A27
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0xFEFFB157
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x8EDC515F

0x51EF4E84
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x430E90CF
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0xCA1DEC14
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xD35D63BE
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0xD58338A2

0x51EF4E84
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x4A533873
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x3A6C466F
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x5C1ADD18
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x2BF05AF1
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0xD760DB6F
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x18D011EB
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x5B29326A
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x9566F8AF
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0xE20ADA50
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x4F9A1722
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x389785CC

0x51EF4E84
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x0F4E612A
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x9253D138
soon."
0x337C6C3A

0x51EF4E84
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x69DE19BB

0x51EF4E84
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x1859501E
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0x12D25561
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0xBEF1901B
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x3F3D73D3
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0xDE82447C
can feel is in her presence."
0xBE429EF5

0x51EF4E84
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0xCADC2B16
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x335D1D70
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x2A0CB084
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x2BC56B6C

0x51EF4E84
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x48686278
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x758FEE37
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0xE2CBDCAC
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x042B7989
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0xA47AF582
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0x386168B0
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x0A8E9F1F
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x5FEF3BAD

0x51EF4E84
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x9A78E17D
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x5D62C3A3
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0xCA0CE1E4
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0xAB32939B
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x7E4DF849
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x5AD82447
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0x14016D38
she do?  Let me hear now."
0x71E0CB16

0x51EF4E84
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0xC65C0FC4
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0xC739D800
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0xD13EDEC1
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x13FE61BB
deeper than I wished.
0xE65499C9

0x51EF4E84
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x2ECB2107
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x45361BBE
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x77F3534F
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x2914D3F3
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0xB191B942
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x99CFB302
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x7B9FF435
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x77C95CE2

0x51EF4E84
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0x58515F7F
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x5C7A91F4
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x9ABC70D4
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0xFCDFFE6B
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0x307F2203
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x612E057F
up.
0x58664AD1

0x51EF4E84
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0x57871C8B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0xF1DEA682

0x51EF4E84
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0x731742E9

0x51EF4E84
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x01898F11
Or what does it mean?"
0x69C57941

0x51EF4E84
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0x8BB2034A

0x51EF4E84
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x411BC693
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x73192213
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0x5CA4E3FC

0x51EF4E84
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0x44986461
perform."
0xE5460359

0x51EF4E84
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x5DAF1E1C
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0xD19107D1

0x51EF4E84
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0xEFC42498
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0x0CCD3F60

0x51EF4E84
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x7DF80C32

0x51EF4E84
"Truly able."
0x3332274F

0x51EF4E84
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0x75F7EBD5

0x51EF4E84
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x1F34A9BF

0x51EF4E84
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0x7AE514D7
parsonic?"
0xFAEA1AF1

0x51EF4E84
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0xCFEE053F
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0xFDE47FFD

0x51EF4E84
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x1182DFC1
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x845F8041
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x9B668EDC

0x51EF4E84
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0x824B3021
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0xD635A133

0x51EF4E84
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0xB74B427B

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0x312E41C4

0x51EF4E84
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x3D3D5A78
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x3895B1A5
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x55E0FB99
immediately charm the snake.
0xB485FDBB

0x51EF4E84
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x6096B454
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0x03A192A7

0x51EF4E84
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0x326DEAEF

0x51EF4E84
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xBD93C7FB
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0xE35A47AE
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0xDFB74BDA
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x71B5482F
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x9DFB0FE1
bargain."
0xC62F713A

0x51EF4E84
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0xB87AA88B
sir."
0xCD30D27A

0x51EF4E84
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0xB8A31F3F
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0xAA530EA1
question or two."  He paused.
0x7540700D

0x51EF4E84
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0xF90DE8D3

0x51EF4E84
Then followed this cross-examination.
0x58AE189F

0x51EF4E84
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x217E6C47
cousin?"
0x10E861F9

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0xDDAD4F02

0x51EF4E84
"Daily."
0xDAA871A0

0x51EF4E84
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0x57D1727B
you are a talented creature!"
0x7754CFEE

0x51EF4E84
"He approved of them--yes."
0xFABBB836

0x51EF4E84
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0xC6F27EEA
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0x5397749A

0x51EF4E84
"I don't know about that."
0x780EE984

0x51EF4E84
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0x98B7252E
there to see you?"
0xA0A6C76E

0x51EF4E84
"Now and then?"
0xCED85101

0x51EF4E84
"Of an evening?"
0x6FBAF58E

0x51EF4E84
"Once or twice."
0x5678132D

0x51EF4E84
A pause.
0x76E79D99

0x51EF4E84
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x7E8A1111
was discovered?"
0xAA085976

0x51EF4E84
"Five months."
0xC68E114D

0x51EF4E84
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0x7469BCA4

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0xEF6C3851
window, and we by the table."
0xBEED72CE

0x51EF4E84
"Did he study much?"
0x109E7B5C

0x51EF4E84
"A good deal."
0x3A9F7897

0x51EF4E84
"What?"
0x15103705

0x51EF4E84
"Hindostanee."
0x6A12AFD0

0x51EF4E84
"And what did you do meantime?"
0xF5B5E9AE

0x51EF4E84
"I learnt German, at first."
0x479599D3

0x51EF4E84
"Did he teach you?"
0xC122A21B

0x51EF4E84
"He did not understand German."
0x3196893C

0x51EF4E84
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0xABE43096

0x51EF4E84
"A little Hindostanee."
0x1FE794BB

0x51EF4E84
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0x9F70C2AB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"And his sisters also?"
0x551E14CE

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"Only you?"
0xC7DD15E1

0x51EF4E84
"Only me."
0x2A41CA2B

0x51EF4E84
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x4F7FAFF9

0x51EF4E84
"No."
0x48857098

0x51EF4E84
"He wished to teach you?"
0x17995826

0x51EF4E84
"Yes."
0x36F179A3

0x51EF4E84
A second pause.
0x50982E1E

0x51EF4E84
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0x8CCD13A7

0x51EF4E84
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xBA826EBF

0x51EF4E84
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0xE16C31DE

0x51EF4E84
"He asked me to marry him."
0xEF14C0AE

0x51EF4E84
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0xCE9EB26C

0x51EF4E84
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0x50B03C99
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0x862609AE

0x51EF4E84
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0xAA9509D3
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0x8DD1B08F
have given you notice to quit?"
0xBDA8D4A8

0x51EF4E84
"Because I am comfortable there."
0xD58AE869

0x51EF4E84
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0xACE27982
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0xE32185DB
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xFA8A3DF4
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x2F79B17A
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x8A2BF7A0
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0x7A822A4E
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0xE3DE5973

0x51EF4E84
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0x082046E6
accord."
0x5D01164A

0x51EF4E84
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0xEDE07A56
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0xABF962D7
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0x8A2637E9

0x51EF4E84
"Where must I go, sir?"
0xEE6C8826

0x51EF4E84
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0xB2BEFA41

0x51EF4E84
"Who is that?"
0xCDA874F6

0x51EF4E84
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0xBB1277DD

0x51EF4E84
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x673C4AA9
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x7613EAC6
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x37BDABAB
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0x93B1274F
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0xA6723EBB
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x4D882A3F
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0xFDB415C0
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x7A6F5D18
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xBD8750F3

0x51EF4E84
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x1B45DC9C
beloved master.  He smiled.
0xC44E53A2

0x51EF4E84
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0x5299C464
you and Rivers?"
0xF9F3C865

0x51EF4E84
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x7DE8A051
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0x6A8C5551
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x7CB5F514
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0x18086DC4
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xA7728FCB
of me from your presence for ever."
0x74318C6A

0x51EF4E84
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0xA221BE3F

0x51EF4E84
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x7D9709C7

0x51EF4E84
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x4EFAF885
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x84B007F2
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x8F69BA62
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0xE5CF4B8D

0x51EF4E84
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0x8AE9555E
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0x1DD0D615
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0xC4F3094E

0x51EF4E84
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0xECF64C19
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xD92BCDB8
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x806751CB
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x36E697C7
offers them so safe a prop."
0x6F92DD6D

0x51EF4E84
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x21010662

0x51EF4E84
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0xC2AA97CE

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0x4242F74B
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x56CE8B83
helped me.
0x2E802E4A

0x51EF4E84
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0x95A324E3

0x51EF4E84
"Do you, sir?"
0x6E3888CB

0x51EF4E84
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0xDB0DC0BE

0x51EF4E84
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0xF8A4BEE1

0x51EF4E84
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0xA6B5C958

0x51EF4E84
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0x62A8643D

0x51EF4E84
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0x3D911AB3

0x51EF4E84
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x14F62313

0x51EF4E84
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x402069F9

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0x3EA04B73

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0xF093343C
on?"
0x31E6AF2C

0x51EF4E84
"Yes, sir."
0x2DA43702

0x51EF4E84
"Truly, Jane?"
0x86EC6307

0x51EF4E84
"Most truly, sir."
0xBE216E73

0x51EF4E84
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0x129E9127

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0x8AD21E42
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0x6E049996
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0x79CA9678
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0xAC0B5EB1

0x51EF4E84
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x8BC8BE14

0x51EF4E84
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0x9D66058F
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x6015FC6D
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0xFBD8F80B
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x02019E1C

0x51EF4E84
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0xFE775BA8

0x51EF4E84
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0x66C73F22
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x7EFBE689
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0xBDE04B24

0x51EF4E84
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0x2A52DC15
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0x7B23CF77
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0x09F8B984
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x94EFDA5F
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0x98794C47
her?"
0x67036294

0x51EF4E84
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x1D95B274

0x51EF4E84
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0xCB0F9485
married instantly."
0x11076285

0x51EF4E84
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x5C0837A7

0x51EF4E84
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0x247D609B
licence to get--then we marry."
0x5E44B6E8

0x51EF4E84
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0xC66524E3
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0xB2FB4E61
your watch."
0xF2D0D833

0x51EF4E84
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0x8FCB78BB
use for it."
0x535808D4

0x51EF4E84
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0xFC76BED8
hungry?"
0x234CC715

0x51EF4E84
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0x56160855
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0xB34AEC9D

0x51EF4E84
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x7576689F
is quite hot."
0x46B8126F

0x51EF4E84
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0x8D1B36A2
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0x2CA3C037
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0xEFB94C9C

0x51EF4E84
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0x3485F1E4

0x51EF4E84
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0x871B65CF

0x51EF4E84
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x7C7ACF9A
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0xF48DED2D
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0x647651E1
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0x55CEAD2D
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x5BB1FF63
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xFD29CD63
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xD69A4EEE
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xA1EE74FB
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0x9E2DA63F
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0xAE9416C7
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0xCC547E06
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x90E95458
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0xB08C97E2
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0x15499ED1
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0x46E1B066

0x51EF4E84
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0x90D30501
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0xEABB3E21
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0x665FEDCE
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0xF6F434D3
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x477EFCC7
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0x17F915F7
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x4E1E6A4C
rejoining Jane.
0x395B5C30

0x51EF4E84
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0x5E536020
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0x1E9C32B0
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0xD82004FF
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x925DF801
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x46A61DC6
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0xF65F55B1
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0xAAC49CA7
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0xC31EC072
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0xDC9E17C2
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x8CFD172A

0x51EF4E84
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0x723F64DF

0x51EF4E84
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0x22302181
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0x16443597

0x51EF4E84
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0xCE3989D7

0x51EF4E84
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0xD28A1EC6
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0x99A0A2BE
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0x28D3B423
that I heard what I now relate.
0x888A639E

0x51EF4E84
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0xE7498280
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0x7BEE6D9C
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x41F6F3C8
are you?'
0xEB0359AB

0x51EF4E84
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x59353900
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xA2C093B8
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0xE529A115
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0x7B3D80ED
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x8FCCD9FD
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x2D53CAB6
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xBA630D0E
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x7E3B4258
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0xD7E09141
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0x633B5712

0x51EF4E84
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0x7F09267E
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xF0087139
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0x4A683F89
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x073F06D2
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0x43EDD228
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xD511F884
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0xD7D0129E
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0xE3A75E5D
them in my heart.
0x58A4283A

0x51EF4E84
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0x4D2D6E2C
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0xC04480C3
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x5D406B57
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x9586C09C
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0x9F6CF6F9
God!"
0x63673BA9

0x51EF4E84
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0x036AC597
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x939E3D56
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x1C1A90E6

0x51EF4E84
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0x890A63DD
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0x8100B03F
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0x5A843906

0x51EF4E84
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0xDFC4147D
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x43C391E1
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0xEFAEE3B8
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
0x98E525DF

0x51EF4E84
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x2939693E

0x51EF4E84

0x51EF4E84
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0x13B87473
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x721E3694
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x682FC18D
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0x701B85A4

0x51EF4E84
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xB808BB74
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0xFD8FDFF2
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x28DF6B30
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x6362B99C
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x9908319B
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x6F4FAAEB
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x2A68AF57
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0x826EA553
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x168BFBC7
again over the roast, said only--
0x5BD00365

0x51EF4E84
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0x24BA0EF0

0x51EF4E84
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x0BF78075
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x45575E74
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xCFB29AF6

0x51EF4E84
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x48C7FED1
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x008E4928
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0xE5A3D83C
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0xD5959DF8
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0xD716C74A
politely pulled his forelock.
0x9F5BEC40

0x51EF4E84
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0xBC77E87B
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x3EC31C83
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0x088176C3
caught the words--
0x492CBAFA

0x51EF4E84
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0xB0AEE15F
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x3885B815
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x8550CC2C

0x51EF4E84
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xBC463E0F
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x95437229
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0xDE42E463
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xA4EB94AB

0x51EF4E84
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0x82F852F7
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x85CA54DD
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x2B351F11
grave or mine."
0x6242C1AC

0x51EF4E84
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x0B0061A1
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0xE13C89BA
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0x91C35A3C
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0x0305CFB3
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x0CC11AA0
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x7E31F6A6
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x34AAA7AC

0x51EF4E84
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0xF3269807
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0xFB374351
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0x95DFB7F1
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x029632D6
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x37D7040D
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x1D3DBC14
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0xCD9C92D2
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x95A3D0B5
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0xCA2E3950
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x9AA9AF3C
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0xD7967150
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x23FFE7BB
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xB2E8C0B8
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0xD6A872E4
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x2777DD7C
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0xB0C846AC
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x8CBA8D26
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0x84674285

0x51EF4E84
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0xC11E71B6
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xE5D3A9D7
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x4D56CD71

0x51EF4E84
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x7BD46B56
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x83D2F1E4
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0xCA124FBD
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xEDFCB7A4
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x008FA3D2
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x4EAFE772
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xC6794F14
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0x332F4362
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0xC57088A1
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x43F75AA0
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x8D8AD22D
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0xEC063D8B
concord is the result.
0xEB166C81

0x51EF4E84
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x444ACE36
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0xE0990E0B
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x19823B48
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0x5F7834A1
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x64C634BC
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xF2B0E842
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0xD6934FBB
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0xE2244A93
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xB3FC1855
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x6C5D9998
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xE5251D2D
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x69CA7295
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x91C5D83E
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x88CDD622
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0xAF388575

0x51EF4E84
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x7BEA9247
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0xCBEF8417
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x2F31C340

0x51EF4E84
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0xA0993AF7

0x51EF4E84
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0x4325C18D

0x51EF4E84
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0x518C5003

0x51EF4E84
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0x9FBC218E
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0xE7D343B9
sure of it.
0x29E64A7B

0x51EF4E84
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x7C748B64
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x538813ED
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x746B7591
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0xC50FC495
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xC2F1BEF6
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xFB7CEEA1
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0xE47E8B8A
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0xB7DC7AE5

0x51EF4E84
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0xE75455F9
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0xEA522F97
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x882E3B6F
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0xA4D9259A
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x16C11BB3
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x2D69711D
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x5123BE48

0x51EF4E84
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x4EC6183E
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0xD133AFE6
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x0B32692C
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x7C65AE33
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x442AB064
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x198B05E5
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x69EABB42
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x0BAB2E51
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x070C254B
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0x5792CF68
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x8722D1B4
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0xE87C5984
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x95461BAE
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xE1E26A84
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x361A32E2

0x51EF4E84
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x7F980539
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0xCA5B8D74
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x657883B9
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0xC5D8D154
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xA5A1D989
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0xED2B9493
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x21A5F499
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0xCA9DEBCD
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x7FBF87B9
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0x0732ED91

0x51EF4E84
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0xF8EE3F42
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0xF9C4CEB1
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

0x87A82287

0x51EF4E84
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x6F90436A
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x1A76D0E5
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0x9F54DC13
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x2C665BAD
people in all walks of life.
0xCE18D64E

0x51EF4E84
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0xFA9D5C54
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0x14A02553
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0xBEF974AD
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0x9B77DF40
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0x1A7294A5
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0xF0A7E1B3
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0x070BB60C
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0x5A93DE31
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0x627BBC24
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0xCCC20DF5
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0x7696E46C
status with the IRS.

0x51EF4E84
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0xF831DA90
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0x01121870
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0xF63D5813
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0x3D5C36F6
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0xB733E1DC
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0x1A5E1D8F
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
0x232362CB
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0x47A27BEA
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
0x754C0413
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0x14F26BA8

0x51EF4E84
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0xF91ECCBD
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0x34C5FC0B
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
0xD141BC9E
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
