PREFACE
0x3E3D1311

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x4D1717B6
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x61CF4400
miscellaneous remark.
0x991BC510

0xC2C4949F
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x307659CE

0xC2C4949F
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x9D65D16F
few pretensions.
0x36B7B474

0xC2C4949F
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x18C906D2
obscure aspirant.
0x6831A44C

0xC2C4949F
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x6A041BF7
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x3FB2C6F6
Author.
0x1506448E

0xC2C4949F
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x2636E504
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x1DA5B54F
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xFE9F6CA9
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x41B21199
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0xAF0FD410
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0x11C2870D

0xC2C4949F
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x5A6FFF2F
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0x2852FB6C
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x9D8F8B9E
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x3ED6D525
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0xD815D68A
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x767435F5
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x62307885
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0xB46F65D2

0xC2C4949F
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x847154C7
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x6F18488E
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x9954F6A4
Thorns.
0xBBEDD592

0xC2C4949F
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xD8B7D44E
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x10C829E6
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x3B5182AA
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0x7271BF5E
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xF942B61E
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0x8B6AB971
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x31BD165C

0xC2C4949F
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x20E73EF6
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0xD0588B61
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xFE3C29C8
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x1DFF3B95
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x320522BD
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x581AF21E

0xC2C4949F
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x33946E88
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0xD860F3E8
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xCCD192AA
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x4572192F

0xC2C4949F
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x8C4A5889
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x55EF0E31
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x81455CE1
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x60A04AAE
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x679D8A19
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x72CC30C1
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x5222DFA6
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x45B8073B
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x48AC0D48
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xD9B06967

0xC2C4949F
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x07E1901F
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x1303CBE2
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0x901F33CA
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0x94836042
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x4F808BB8
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0x13395BED
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0xEE3755E1
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x7719F656
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x0FF7E8AB
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x4165E302
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xC3B22F2E
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0x6C6B9698
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x0B8672DC
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xB34905E9
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0x4B68182A

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x2C77D632
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0xD7E19BC6
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x449CC0C2
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xD3B022B6
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0xC363D8D7
denied where it is justly due.
0x95B6EF26

0xC2C4949F
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0xAA68E917
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0xC3218D36

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x62B8C7A6
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x8F4F44C3
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0xA29AECF3
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0xA579E151
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xC8507EAA

0xC2C4949F
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xB7AD9F8C
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x0C3A2ED5
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xB80BC957
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x9A793537
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0x0F6BD795

0xC2C4949F
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x84BBBBA3
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xC2198D81
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x1A9C4D30
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x4AB375DF
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0xDCC582E7
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0x133221B8
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x47EE438C
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0xCF0D3301
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x87FA6F6B
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x92A59650
little children."
0x63972E7C

0xC2C4949F
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x17F4E3F5

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x9560D5F2
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0xF67AC184
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0xE259C2DE

0xC2C4949F
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x584EFC13
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xC1CCE992
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0xD42A06AF
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0xD208E463
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0x00B13CC5
retirement.
0x01B7FE39

0xC2C4949F
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0xE88167A5
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x9F5E8BDC
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xA3FBD057
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xF05944D8
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0xB0C88AB3
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0xC64B1797
lamentable blast.
0x8EBB880B

0xC2C4949F
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0xAE793BBC
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0xFA3AAD89
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x96C42A93
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0xF73387D9
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x601D1E3F
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x6DC0347B
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0xEE8402B7

0xC2C4949F
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0xDA045925
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x868D83D9
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xDF1EB4D9
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x2A07B43F

0xC2C4949F
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0xAFF2E621
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x807628C9
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0xFD60A7F2
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x17D3247C
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x4B1349E5
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x2300C050
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0x37EAB972
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x241FCA3F
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0xFD0531FD
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x024E4BFC
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x710882C3
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0xC9111EC1
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x706A8ACD

0xC2C4949F
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x8A9D346A
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x61F484F8
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x90D849CA
hour of eventide.
0xB5E146A1

0xC2C4949F
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0xA9327E39

0xC2C4949F
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0xAA4BBE72
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0xF07D5AC8

0xC2C4949F
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0xE03845A5
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0xFCF6953A

0xC2C4949F
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0xED9111C8
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x2C99CCAE
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0xF634F427
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0xD4588512
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0xA69230E7
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0xD2309DDE
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xA08D31ED
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x00391F3E
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x9A7C7881

0xC2C4949F
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x57C08A4E
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x14206CCF
room door opened.
0xEEC7EDD7

0xC2C4949F
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0x0CB678E2
found the room apparently empty.
0xF3F1F738

0xC2C4949F
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0xF00E64B6
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x45130C95
animal!"
0x3E59C59D

0xC2C4949F
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x8DBD06F6
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x0A8A14C4
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x950CD436
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0xD7B6BAD3

0xC2C4949F
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x7CBBB91D

0xC2C4949F
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0xC46CCE10
forth by the said Jack.
0x14F0DE1A

0xC2C4949F
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0xC2EBEBB4

0xC2C4949F
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xFFB90FF2
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x2DC6C12F
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xE21CD3CA

0xC2C4949F
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0x7905667C
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0xF5F9E5EB
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0x5FFE9ABB
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0xD2733A4F
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0xDBE52746
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0xE7EE64ED
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x8C11E213
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x3FD70DE0
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x926F4777
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0x64AC3AB7
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x451266D3
home.
0x89579755

0xC2C4949F
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x4FE523A1
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0x6742072D
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0x6037A10D
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x8B34183D
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x5BADD148
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0x3838187F
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xE75F576D
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x4EE7765A
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0xB2A6707C
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x27744D67
her back.
0x89964316

0xC2C4949F
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0xF8FB9B75
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0xDA1E62A2
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0xCDA09162
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x21DD739F
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x6FC5955E
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x7DE87C63
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0xEF5055C3
chair.
0xFA2408F1

0xC2C4949F
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0xAE903574
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x59DC91B1
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x8F4D0E65

0xC2C4949F
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x66B6A8A4
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x9151A8E8
insult.
0x1A9EE29A

0xC2C4949F
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0x9DDCE3DB

0xC2C4949F
"I was reading."
0x010D5F5A

0xC2C4949F
"Show the book."
0xA0A09ED0

0xC2C4949F
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0xB9B4DDCE

0xC2C4949F
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x7153FFE6
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xBEA4FE4F
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0xC8D0CE4E
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0x0F63570F
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xEC41A2F8
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0xFBD93F66
the mirror and the windows."
0xF417676E

0xC2C4949F
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0x563EB4AE
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x5173428E
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x54DB8A2B
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x3E1BDCC0
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0x4D96210D
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0xFD97149A

0xC2C4949F
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x4507932B
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0xB3088AD0

0xC2C4949F
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x61390B45
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0xED3D9392
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0xBAC14395

0xC2C4949F
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x6B37AD41
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xA7349243

0xC2C4949F
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0x5AEC9B3A
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x4DC9F4E9
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x676DBF1B
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x95F0BE58
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x16C5502F
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0xDAD32E35
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x54F8C30B
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0x17024E07
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x1BFB9EEC

0xC2C4949F
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0xEF21B3E8

0xC2C4949F
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x69E650E5

0xC2C4949F
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x9CD0D22A

0xC2C4949F
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x65D965CB
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER II
0x554EA5B0

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xAFC45970
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0xB3BD421F
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0xA8EFDDC2
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x08D33800
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x476A3095
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x3AADCA8E

0xC2C4949F
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x52EEDF15

0xC2C4949F
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x2C96CD3D
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x173F78AE
young master."
0x64CAE91E

0xC2C4949F
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x7179400A

0xC2C4949F
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x89206CFB
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x20296862

0xC2C4949F
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0xE279243C
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0x08595764
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0xC7CBCAA7

0xC2C4949F
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0xE5A2F9EA
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0xBDF2BCC4

0xC2C4949F
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0xE0A2BCE5
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x2F500375
little of the excitement out of me.
0x4C0E05BE

0xC2C4949F
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x35C0C414

0xC2C4949F
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x348446A7

0xC2C4949F
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0xBE24D083
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0xF3CAEA89
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xF17AA7AC
incredulous of my sanity.
0xFB5D1590

0xC2C4949F
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x1DE07CDC

0xC2C4949F
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x7867EC71
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x26C7C737
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0x1D6D66A8

0xC2C4949F
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0x81855906
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xC034627C
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x22EA921F

0xC2C4949F
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0x9F7B5563
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0x3AE7A78E
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0x608CBDE1
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x4A640754

0xC2C4949F
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x398539CA
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x96222CB1
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x493660ED
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0xF1529FC2
them."
0x39FB7C45

0xC2C4949F
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0xE2F96E21
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x4503246E
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0xE2F230BB
away, I am sure."
0xC9D075EF

0xC2C4949F
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0xDFAD2245
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xF2A6D843
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x0A45019C
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0x48168225
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x287349D7
fetch you away."
0xBD248297

0xC2C4949F
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0x5D916D04

0xC2C4949F
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x3A2A854A
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0x7505DDE6
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x85531C77
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0xB2E31283
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xEAAADF88
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x9196EC48
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x1E4ACDC4
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x74CF5451
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xCE0CEB15
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x75A7894A
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xAAA615E1
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0xDAC8F467
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x12B28F8C
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x84025FDB
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x56B64BD1
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x9C34E83B

0xC2C4949F
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0x9DB856AC
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0xEB2786A9
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0xB6E7BA7A
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x1B6811FC
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0xB4E9EF20
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x36556517
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x087D43D7
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x908D85EF
in spite of its grandeur.
0xD696CE64

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x9890D26D
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x832E9DD4
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x3300F04C
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0x22F68584

0xC2C4949F
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x80A5430E
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0x2496A3BB
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xBBA35D9D
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x5A217C71
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0x4DC36677
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xCFABBD29
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x20E50E37
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x7CD34700
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0x5E8BC8DE
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x7B01B4C4
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xD58D50AF
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x98CAFDDA
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x406DD6B2
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0xE4096EC5
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0xDE7EC86A
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x5B909D38

0xC2C4949F
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0xC42FFDD1
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0xD017FC3E
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0x6E4C5D0A
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x348A010E

0xC2C4949F
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xEF84AD90
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x2C7ACEF1
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0xCFDC9A42
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x2BC49109
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x52E8DAD3
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0x8126D24E
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0xBA4E5708
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x45D9CA4D
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x60B75032
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x7EAE822D
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x03118D24
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0xB2A2348E
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x9F799E1D
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0xE61512ED
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0xD8F4056E
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0xBE242C7F
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x9CAA957F
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x72D065E9
night.
0x4AC5A855

0xC2C4949F
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x3731C664
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x3B5DD449
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x76C5967B
general opprobrium.
0xDBEA89D9

0xC2C4949F
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x9105A86C
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x18AD02BC
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x2CB0D5DE
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x28D9A119
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0x712E87E9

0xC2C4949F
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x83FAA9DD
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0xA50EADEF
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x1FD25046
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0x805D1B0A
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xFB03CE88

0xC2C4949F
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0x8B3EC9B9
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xA66C3322
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0x73EAA2F5
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x5146EA7D
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x0BD60A9A
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x37AAF2A4
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0xEE8A69F6
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x10254018
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0xFA079F77
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x6334B733
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x6FA3881C
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0xF2AE5C3D
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xF7B7A174

0xC2C4949F
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0xB16CF563
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0xA0BB6FBC
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x8C34C0A7
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x941D5C40
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x03F61CD0
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0xD6BE7E4F
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0xDD7C8FB0
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0x7E197B2D
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0xC3C2D49B
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x7CC657EC
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x699BBDB2
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xF87C78D9
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0xEB1CEBB1
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0xD028B28C
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x851BD2E9
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x70A6CD1D
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0xA012C439
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0xF2DA83E4
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x0A886332
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0x66CDF253
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x070A8119
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x4E358DF4

0xC2C4949F
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x72CD8E74
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0x6ECB21BD
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0xE781305F
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x33668FBF
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0xD10AC07A
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0xD42B6907
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0xBCB1050D
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x1C90A973
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0xDB8EAD18
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xCA4857A0
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0x8903A595
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x4F0B5D5A
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0xE3895C8E
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x796E0600
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0xEBD549AD
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x24406507
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xF3C8C1F4
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x1BFDFC12
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0xFECB777B
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x39C03405
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0xFEFB90E7
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0x88E7F42E
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0xF556BF0B
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0xE106C70E
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0xDBA36079
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0x81752E48
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0xA3FFB6C0
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x280977BA
Abbot entered.
0xC8727339

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x418F0F30

0xC2C4949F
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0xE619A1A6

0xC2C4949F
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0x1EC94510

0xC2C4949F
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0x2219384B
Bessie.
0x0A59435F

0xC2C4949F
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x47A6AF87
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x33D49580

0xC2C4949F
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0xDA1E032D
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x870A2A66
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x624CDE1F

0xC2C4949F
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xE5CCEC20
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x5E90B746
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0xCFCB94E1
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0x8BCEC9B1

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0xF3648EDB

0xC2C4949F
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x02633A01
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x3CD1D8D7
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x0F93254C
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x233E16C8
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x822D0EC0
then."
0x19FC1E46

0xC2C4949F
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0x036E412D
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x661B913E

0xC2C4949F
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0x62D487B7
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0xA11B478F
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x526561E3
duplicity.
0xD864F2A2

0xC2C4949F
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0xB36AEB2E
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x3260B09C
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x28A3CCEC
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0xE9BB8AFD

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xC054D4EF
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x4346F366
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0xCE82CF39
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0xC4F1F853
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x8B77DC53
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x6928C466
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x001C0B00
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0xE3596A4C
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0x8E916D68

0xC2C4949F
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0xD47020F8
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0x4D6A5A7F
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0xFE025273
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x2E6B2490
pillow, leaning over me.
0xC6858B42

0xC2C4949F
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0x7FD774A7
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x08DFCF0A
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0xA311EF7C
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x72F9C2C2
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0xCF1E8486
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x01CD29E4
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x0D20990E
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x2664040D

0xC2C4949F
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xB3E703BF

0xC2C4949F
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0xF557C976
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x96462BFE
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xF45D0BEC
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x670A57D4
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x1BCBA88E
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x5DE8AD43
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0x7DF502C8
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x7D3B3DF7

0xC2C4949F
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x8DBB1B76

0xC2C4949F
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0xFE74F8B1
rough.  "I will try."
0xA461DE93

0xC2C4949F
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0xA4B51790

0xC2C4949F
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0x0B4CC76B

0xC2C4949F
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0xD475E4B7
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x7276F71D

0xC2C4949F
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0x9C4C0984

0xC2C4949F
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x070D4F5D

0xC2C4949F
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x19CB980F
soon, no doubt."
0x1A11AAC3

0xC2C4949F
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0x5D54B60C
say--
0x0EF9E221

0xC2C4949F
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xBE73747F
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x8C596C07
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0xA8CF5CDD
rather too hard."
0x0AC5D196

0xC2C4949F
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x154E805F
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x03039E1B
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0x6C354E59
the main subject discussed.
0x719D533C

0xC2C4949F
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x393D4F87
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0x723F0A24
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x92A1EA8C

0xC2C4949F
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0x6B3BDFC9
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x9CA21175
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0xFADA1384

0xC2C4949F
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0x13461544
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x3D92DA6A
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0x499DF125
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0xFC7F504D
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x725F8A5D
bad propensities.
0xDB0A32C2

0xC2C4949F
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x21927D87
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x1DE806DE
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xD8F1D6C8
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x57FDCB5F
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x53560623
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x441D6AFD
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0xE4EB23EA
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xF4679D1C
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x75E17022
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0x60AC4B11
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xA8D475B7
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x3F0D98C5
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0x26429996

0xC2C4949F
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0x67BE5D02
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x2C07C38E
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x9241CEFE
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x99416B6C
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0x006E3DE7
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0xDCEB77B0
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0x0CE3451D
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x1A2AE0BC
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xAE59136C
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xB2FFAF37
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x4885E5AE
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x4A7CB083
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x832E972E
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x91C4CADC
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x390CB446
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x8AEA7B6D
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0xE7949180
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x3E7E8CD7
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x47D83B1D
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x4245AE61
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0xDD954043
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xCBD30323
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0xCE4CD47C
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0xCED506C8
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x8DF696C0
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x62C61342
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0x4C650C65
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x9CD4ACB7
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0xDFD531B8
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0xE0DE264F
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xF17DFE2C
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x77AFDEFE
untasted tart.
0xA7FDF6BD

0xC2C4949F
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0xC47A6126
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xC46441D5
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x625536ED
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0xB273CB55

0xC2C4949F
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x73BC9B70
      A long time ago."
0xA19AEF8B

0xC2C4949F
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x0496DF10
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0xFA187781
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x37E3C0D6
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0xE20DE4F4
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0xEDDC8A8B
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x59F54D36
one.
0xF1113892

0xC2C4949F
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x5F22E81F
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x06497050
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x7CAA3C87
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0x6D922F72

0xC2C4949F
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0xEDBC91BF
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0xCDD4D6A2
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x8943353D
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x471BC0A4

0xC2C4949F
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0xBD01B390
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0x58DDC3BF
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xE7462D4F
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0xE726FE4F

0xC2C4949F
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x8F5A8C40
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0xEF842E8A
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x0374EA39
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0x21CB9744

0xC2C4949F
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0xBEC740BB
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0xE5170803
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0x4BBF1B6C
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0x3C8E96CE

0xC2C4949F
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x4D3501C5
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x26B09123
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x7B8CDA53
Lloyd came again.
0x38699EA2

0xC2C4949F
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x798F1354
how is she?"
0xED2302D0

0xC2C4949F
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0x1C58450F

0xC2C4949F
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0xDA2AC179
is Jane, is it not?"
0xEE355048

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x1E2A0D77

0xC2C4949F
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x5B3F9407
Have you any pain?"
0x9266F5B8

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0xC2C4949F
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x2EB38E83
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0x7735A165

0xC2C4949F
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x1D5437B2

0xC2C4949F
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x012645E4
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x7FB3960E
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xA075A42A

0xC2C4949F
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x958F9430

0xC2C4949F
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x2346E682
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x32FB39A0
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x526CBD59
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xF4A3C639
leisure, he said--
0x08A18DEC

0xC2C4949F
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0xDB681A92

0xC2C4949F
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x91B5F450

0xC2C4949F
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x9F2D9B60
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x101E363F

0xC2C4949F
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0x00FD20B7
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x0894476A
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0x743E79BA

0xC2C4949F
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0xE72EA49C
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0xBE5EE353
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x2A1EC09E

0xC2C4949F
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0x889133AD
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x6FFAD874

0xC2C4949F
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0xC556A795
Bessie was gone.
0xE78B3BFA

0xC2C4949F
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0xCFAAD2F5

0xC2C4949F
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0xC6F69DCA

0xC2C4949F
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0xBBAAACBD

0xC2C4949F
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x65846F67
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0xEAF7DCAF
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0xF063AD7C
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x49198342

0xC2C4949F
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0xC2BD25DC
daylight?"
0x00BEFCA8

0xC2C4949F
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x677DC7C3
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0x976D5E6D

0xC2C4949F
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0xE1B5E605

0xC2C4949F
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0x97EB8E45
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x598AD09C
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xBAD9529E
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0xFC413F74
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x1ABDE45A
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0x114308CA
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x8CDD24A1

0xC2C4949F
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0x0CA18E6D

0xC2C4949F
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x92FBF653

0xC2C4949F
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0xDF15BE45

0xC2C4949F
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0xAB672B2E

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0x8A787389

0xC2C4949F
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xE253C918
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0x08BED5E0

0xC2C4949F
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0xB4B5E055
than a servant."
0x53A486DB

0xC2C4949F
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0xCFCAFFEF

0xC2C4949F
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x65C3D44F
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0xFEB042E5

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x8C3A36CC

0xC2C4949F
"I think not, sir."
0x46311982

0xC2C4949F
"None belonging to your father?"
0x620CFDC8

0xC2C4949F
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0x5A67215F
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x3317FEBC
them."
0x39FB7C45

0xC2C4949F
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x29439603

0xC2C4949F
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x8C840FA4
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xDB8A06B7
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0xBAC78733
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0xBC15EDFE
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x66EA7AF3

0xC2C4949F
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x4B6A0DE8

0xC2C4949F
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0xD4849E1D

0xC2C4949F
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x6B46569B
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x93494910
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0xC8A5918E
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x10A1AA8F
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0x4E0D114D
the price of caste.
0x0B057156

0xC2C4949F
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x953F4D1E

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0xDB234EC4
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x266C3D23

0xC2C4949F
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x39C55755

0xC2C4949F
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x6F636852
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xE6DE26DD
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0xA72AE15C
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x8A3BF72A
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0xCABB90F5
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0x4D405BEB
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xFFB7D052
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0xF6E0F0E9
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xCBD24E1F
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x21015DA6
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x9D7708CA
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0xC0599052
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x157690F9
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0x3798F818

0xC2C4949F
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x7C2FE787
musings.
0x749E99B5

0xC2C4949F
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0x90BC8DD1
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x2850F3B7
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0xEC8735EC

0xC2C4949F
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x0C775991
the gravel-walk.
0x9040509B

0xC2C4949F
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0x2899CD49
to her before I go."
0x507C7E23

0xC2C4949F
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0xA341C824
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0xDB2A7450
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x5D1D8FB9
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xBC590DA5
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0x2408A802
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x08A28C9A
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x4F854638
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x1331FB46
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x5F15CDDF
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0xDA1C8949

0xC2C4949F
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0x8EDF4B7D
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0x4D8112C9
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x42E17C3B
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0xF3B8F787
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0xD3B94822
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x2615C338
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x12856065
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0xE148981F
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0xECDD9082
of each other.
0x942DC4FB

0xC2C4949F
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0xC84A8A2B
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x5F93E1CA

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0xE123F50F
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0xE065204D
little toad as that."
0xD7EB67E3

0xC2C4949F
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0xD4203603
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x0D17E549

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0x59880ECE
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x164890E9
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x25A250C6
rabbit for supper."
0xACA45DDE

0xC2C4949F
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
0xBE94D23C

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER IV
0x8B53D704

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0x1E5CB111
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x9BBB5009
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0x8154AFD4
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0xBF892831
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x5778741A
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0xF274D520
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x9B1ED6C7
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0xD5D55846
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x5DD1478B
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x791D945B
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x063ED1B7
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x8F25B554
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x76068700
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0xE3298E90
and rooted aversion.
0x820BCE61

0xC2C4949F
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0xB9A3C145
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xF902F89E
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0xF7806B75
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x37818E29
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0xABA38CF8
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0xDAB60551
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xAEF43C4F
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x244FA080
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xAAB9A524
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0xE2D5BF7B
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0x8700458C
was stopped rather harshly--
0x9A2DAD76

0xC2C4949F
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x93F95F3D
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0xCC39757E
should associate with her."
0xCACD0C98

0xC2C4949F
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x87E32F42
deliberating on my words--
0x770656AD

0xC2C4949F
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x4602911C

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x0E3D2010
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x7DEA950C
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x98DC4BC0
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0x0BA22AD9
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x98B272F4

0xC2C4949F
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0xD865C7AD
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x06541083
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0x638BA0F7
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x8D4F4231

0xC2C4949F
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0x4FCDC84A
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0xB13355DF
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0xE013003B
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x9B990B49

0xC2C4949F
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x55C94C57
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0x60E4A783
wish me dead."
0xF0AB671D

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x7FD57D5F
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xCACDB513
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0xFC6A419B
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0x95BD8F12
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x764608DD
in my breast.
0x60F03535

0xC2C4949F
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x4D900D3A
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0xFE664236
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0xF7788AEE
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0x65F61490
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0x6D523FE8
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0x5A215F30
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x634A45AE
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0xD6593967
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x35D98887
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xF96B7AAD
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x40D74A14
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0xCD601FD9
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0xD21B4B67
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0xB6F3CE17
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x637E3870
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xAA9D53EA
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0x90FA509F
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x43424D4F
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0xE3DDE9AA
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0xB126172E
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0xF963372E
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x69FFAFA4
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x89C93AC3
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0xB08AE273
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x087507BD
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x7FA4D202
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0xA34551A6
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0x180DD098
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x59656DE7
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x9BF51759
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xB6CBA79B
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x20714AF9
to be happy likewise.
0x80544840

0xC2C4949F
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0xE1A09AC4
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x8E01045A
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x98E690FE
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x713C72EB
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0xA885354D
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x7537EB70
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x3D84FF8D
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x299F3912
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x292D782F
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xA8B31DFC
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x016BDB73
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xCAC73A28
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0xB76EE0A8
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xA82E586A
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x5213E5B3
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x473F0FD3
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x2A4FB541
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0xAD153317
Gateshead Hall.
0x7E8AA93F

0xC2C4949F
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0x72E997EE
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0xBD65EF15
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0xCCAA3097
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0xCB62B953
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0xF68DE17B
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0xBE2300EC
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x8C640E7E
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x0D075524
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xB3BA378A
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x3E7B18A1
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x3D5ACBA2
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0xEA0E4D96
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xB3870348
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0xF68ACF2F
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0x005DF226
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0xCD5CCB84
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0xB8C4AFB2
accuracy.
0x32383784

0xC2C4949F
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x3360A031
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x14C0DDA5
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0xF930786E
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0xDDF21D33
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x6B35DB7A
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x2F6C21DB
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x1ACD5DED
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0x0882BB97
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0xD17D9E45
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x811CB9BE
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x282CE282
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x2E212591
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0xE056DB2A
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xE57278F5
frost.
0xA7F23E2B

0xC2C4949F
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0xC87A7A0E
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x1BF3B11C
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xD89EE848
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xE4A82F94
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0xA8A7CFFE
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x57C28728
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0x823FE0B1
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x1D7B94E0
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0xA282CC97
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0xF15FE901
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0xCAC7C965
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0xB33E8A47
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xB558CAC2
nursery.
0x0FFD175D

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x4E9260EA
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0xFCD4073E
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x5A766911
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0xDEE7118E
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0xD071B9A8

0xC2C4949F
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x30DC1CAF

0xC2C4949F
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x8E5FAEF7
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x03C04BF9
window for?"
0x6DAF7983

0xC2C4949F
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x136CA464
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xA1EAD0EB
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x1816443A
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x7DD3A645
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0xFA105A74
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0x11019AB9

0xC2C4949F
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x094DD100
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0xBE59C7BD
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x318DEE31
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0xB48CF270
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0xF87ABBDB
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x32D1471F

0xC2C4949F
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xE5580C1F
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0xA753B8F8
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x3C0125E9
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x1CE37A8E
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0xA07068CB
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x7A1B76CB

0xC2C4949F
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x67A5EE85
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x2EDD77CA
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0xC683630A
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x61A77E90
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0xCE882C00
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x7DBAAC6A
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x88050288
by way of capital.
0x008D15E9

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0xA11DCAAD
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0xCBF1F1B1
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x70061D3E
you."
0x7B4FD10F

0xC2C4949F
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x38BD69E5
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x61D4D53B
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0xDC02E01B
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x363BCB54

0xC2C4949F
"Ten years."
0x852668B8

0xC2C4949F
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x5A75E79F
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x17E030DA

0xC2C4949F
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0xCFF67F09

0xC2C4949F
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x2EB8959D
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0x2D733CB5
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0xB27106D7

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0xA1E82232

0xC2C4949F
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0xD7B142AF
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x27186B38
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x03C71812
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x85FBA731

0xC2C4949F
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x025A1F99
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x3831FC7D
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x167A8B19

0xC2C4949F
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x0C126C9D
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0xE9B8653A
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x031B5C76

0xC2C4949F
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x6711BFCA
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x75E8094C

0xC2C4949F
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x139A242D

0xC2C4949F
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x9F10C6EB

0xC2C4949F
"A pit full of fire."
0x3603B319

0xC2C4949F
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x64E39659
ever?"
0xEA2C794C

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0xC2C4949F
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0xD33785BD

0xC2C4949F
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x442A8E58
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xDE2E7542

0xC2C4949F
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xCB04C307
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x701E1DA7
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x6E1F844D
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0xDDA04EAE

0xC2C4949F
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0xEB5DC62E
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0xD74CFAB9
enough away.
0xFA722945

0xC2C4949F
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0xF15A62C9
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x5447B042

0xC2C4949F
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x2B4D7762
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x459948EF

0xC2C4949F
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0xDBA60BA5

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x77374851

0xC2C4949F
"Sometimes."
0x0BD418E8

0xC2C4949F
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x0E822960

0xC2C4949F
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xE06602D6
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xDA8AEFB1
and Jonah."
0x67273639

0xC2C4949F
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x7BC87C7D

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0xC2C4949F
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x00B7FCB0
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0xE04A6C2D
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x4ACB7986
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x50D7793B
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x9858BF75
piety."
0xC7604A7B

0xC2C4949F
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x05D95468

0xC2C4949F
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x0A207AF8
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0xFB12C758
give you a heart of flesh."
0xAB4E52B0

0xC2C4949F
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x0A2EB4ED
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x88698417
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0xCA610E29
conversation herself.
0x0393AF92

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0xDAAA32B9
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0x37D4D8D3
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x174C9249
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xED15CDED
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0xDA299B63
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0x0C646605
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x0ACAE6E7

0xC2C4949F
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x1BFE3015
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0xAFBF25E3
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0xDFC1C22A
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0x1EDF282C
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0xBE09557F
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x1C1F5318
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0xAF6DDC60
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x4EF72B03
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0x7FD1CB0A
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xFC3CE19C

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x098F9A44
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x235B3B39

0xC2C4949F
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0xFD11757F
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0x289DEDD7
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0x4DED6A25
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x42E12F5D

0xC2C4949F
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0x0E78B812
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0xA0D53783
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x1514DC35
Lowood."
0xCD9A9755

0xC2C4949F
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x4818FF98
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x8D589BCB
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x91BE1EBD
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0xD77C431B
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0x7170B97C
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xC44A748C
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x8174CB2C
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x7EB3C1EB
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x87AEDF87
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x0A5C05E0
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x24821D74
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0xC63CCD92

0xC2C4949F
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x55EFAED3
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0x37C6B251
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0xF5E39904
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0xEFB65C0F

0xC2C4949F
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0xAC7D79AF
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xC110DDDF
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x85B8EC17
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xA60DEA12
inhabitants."
0x13839096

0xC2C4949F
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x56FC29B6
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0x82513E7C
and prospects?"
0x2150BDFA

0xC2C4949F
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x9B1D99DE
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0xFEB38DCC
of her election."
0xD40D3E6B

0xC2C4949F
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x8AA879FF
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x3DC5C233
becoming too irksome."
0xA94DA94C

0xC2C4949F
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0xCF675D24
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0xCFAD3A00
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x1CFB3B20
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x47FE8B78
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x5924BD6B

0xC2C4949F
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0xB9CBB0CF
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x0431462D

0xC2C4949F
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0x00431E05
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x85F6617B
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0xB5F3B832
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x5FCAC7BA

0xC2C4949F
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0x885DA080
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xA936D2E4

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x62C01ACF
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0xA4610E6E
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0xFA5BF81A
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0x8D277301
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x68B50A6E
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0xA308F8F2
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x88A9A920
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x362C9E7F
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0xEC84A3A1
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x290409F6
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0xD9ECDC3A
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0xC9486033
handsome attire.
0x706407D1

0xC2C4949F
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xD4DE7C1E
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x5A6AE534
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x12C8A57A
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x56243077
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x8DFDFAB8
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0xBCA58F6A
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0xF0AFD464
fomented now within me.
0xF87A6467

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x749AD5E7
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x88DE6208

0xC2C4949F
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0xC7D6C079
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0xF6127DCB
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x99315DE2
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xCD25C8A8
to her.
0x572B0A31

0xC2C4949F
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x93252424
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0xDB1C12B4
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x0D90E093

0xC2C4949F
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x0ED261F2
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x40E1D5A5
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x40400A91
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0xEF4CEA77

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x845FC3A7
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0xDC314D9B

0xC2C4949F
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xA4EF6E57
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x55F1F49E
used to a child.
0x4FEF5A8C

0xC2C4949F
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x29E69F96
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x63554C55

0xC2C4949F
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0xCC716666
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0xD44B7A7F
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x0963C28E
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0xAE676E3A
miserable cruelty."
0x37ED7404

0xC2C4949F
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0xF265C71B

0xC2C4949F
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x90368759
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x67DB7F51
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x48D56561
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xEE807715
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x9C14CBF2
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x6FC14506
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0xF09D19A5
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0x85F4E7B1
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0xBACF4260
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x17367B29

0xC2C4949F
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xB8DA756F

0xC2C4949F
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xB5229841
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x7CA4E6D9
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x68A1A574
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0xCB1DB54A
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x17EA8551
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x2E402DDE
would cry.
0x69EF39C9

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x1BE8AF51
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x9E34DA55

0xC2C4949F
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0xBF369556

0xC2C4949F
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x5D7CB4C1
your friend."
0x14E26D93

0xC2C4949F
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xE861168C
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0x3FA3DBED
you have done."
0x294A1084

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x44DA51A8
their faults."
0x277C0040

0xC2C4949F
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0xEF614A66

0xC2C4949F
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0xD2919A2C
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0xBDDB5B88

0xC2C4949F
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0xBFAAEEA2
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xD59BEB8F

0xC2C4949F
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x6522204D
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x3DC7B6E7

0xC2C4949F
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0xE62D4AC4
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0x7D443408
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x2DFFED08
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x948E0DF1
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x009173E3
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0x7BBA4443
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0x9FF0C676
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0xE42CEFA8
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0x8ADC74CC
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x830A37FB
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x769DA929
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x9D78B996
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x4ACED6FC
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x828F39A0

0xC2C4949F
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x88F6555B
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xEF4E1477
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x27A35437
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0x4C4DA9E7
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x95AAFA58
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x32FFFD5B
of my nature.
0xBB884097

0xC2C4949F
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0xC99C9348
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x6B9DA839
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x0CA79610
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x45944456
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x17B0D34A
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xDCA24332
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0xDA623BF5
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0xBD76DA55
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x8CF9F4B1
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0xEED11845
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0xD7125C2B
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0x3E857FA1
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x5233913A
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x5D50911C
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0x2B392851
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0xF6024633
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0xDF9B2D56
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0xD8F7CE70

0xC2C4949F
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xDAC93424
to lunch!"
0xB007DD9F

0xC2C4949F
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0x78C18411
came tripping down the path.
0xCCF4715F

0xC2C4949F
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x1CF940CB
called?"
0xFFC76E84

0xC2C4949F
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0xF8B4D4FE
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x4C2ECC2F
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0x3BE00DC8
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x766F32FE
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0xAE36B353
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0xC11A0F0B

0xC2C4949F
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0xE3AE5C75
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0x29D1D5E2

0xC2C4949F
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0xAA4D5700
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0xC9720D6B
suppose?"
0xD21D464C

0xC2C4949F
I nodded.
0x553265AA

0xC2C4949F
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x291AF0B6

0xC2C4949F
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0xECB24433

0xC2C4949F
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0x70433469
be bolder."
0x7C1FB6F3

0xC2C4949F
"What! to get more knocks?"
0xBA609285

0xC2C4949F
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0xD8C53641
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x7B35851F
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x2C920996
for you."
0x15F1BAC6

0xC2C4949F
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0x5AEAD9BD

0xC2C4949F
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x9F504F50
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x95736800
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xB01E269B
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xF52FCA00
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x0F533AC2
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0xD4ED3C94

0xC2C4949F
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x2E0B2B98

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x84877711
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x350F15CB
provoking."
0xB0F4352C

0xC2C4949F
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0xD235EAE0
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x279A8BC7
dread."
0x56070FC4

0xC2C4949F
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x7460B2FA

0xC2C4949F
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x7172985D

0xC2C4949F
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0x484BB694
others."
0xB9840C47

0xC2C4949F
"You don't show it."
0xAC5EEAD1

0xC2C4949F
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0x461418AC
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0xC7AC8E74

0xC2C4949F
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0xBB1FC1FF
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x6C8096D3
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x48734DE6

0xC2C4949F
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0xD8C68480

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0xE7796202

0xC2C4949F
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x1D740B8B
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0xC9D1667E
you'd _rather_ not."
0x5BC1A506

0xC2C4949F
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0x87285B4B
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x45F98087
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xD16DBC16
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x5F29B390
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.

CHAPTER V
0x433631BC

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0xA669A388
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x8C815A90
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x5A135484
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0xBECB2726
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xEE950FA5
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0xD269D05F
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x2CE7B1CF
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0xF04688E5
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xEB88C7F9
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0x28360F7B
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xDB3F1835
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0xD240EF6E
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xD36FB61C
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x598A4599
bye?"
0x543FD615

0xC2C4949F
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x84ED1E0C
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x7B050295
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x260362DA
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x6C49C965

0xC2C4949F
"What did you say, Miss?"
0xDBD5362A

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x0F79F4F8
the wall."
0x0E7E448B

0xC2C4949F
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0xB3955B18

0xC2C4949F
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x9C178048
been my foe."
0x35273794

0xC2C4949F
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0x86742C06

0xC2C4949F
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0x8107151B
out at the front door.
0xAFAD0CE4

0xC2C4949F
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0xCADAC91B
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x968537DC
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0xA933EE12
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0xF6C1FBAE
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0xCF205D57
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x99261A46
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0xA0E6FF66
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xD4818219
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0xC4FB3866

0xC2C4949F
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0xBCB01003

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"And how far is it?"
0xB5AEFAF7

0xC2C4949F
"Fifty miles."
0x410136F9

0xC2C4949F
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x87C5AF45
alone."
0xBF08EAEB

0xC2C4949F
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xD3F944C8
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x3D5209FE
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0x7F70C946
with kisses.
0xA829F675

0xC2C4949F
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0xE526B585
me into the inside.
0xF472B8BB

0xC2C4949F
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0x8107D1C6
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0xF51B8D89
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0xBF69C41C
mysterious regions.
0xD9792199

0xC2C4949F
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x694B4480
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x5BA3A2C7
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x4FD105FD
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xF5572DCE
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x4D3A27C5
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x20721C63
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xFECF3089
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x44FE7BC6
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x52E1A958
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x4B37B30A
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x8A0CC2D4
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xCDCD84FA
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0x65137689
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0x86BDD082
"stony street" of L-.
0xD0FF066F

0xC2C4949F
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0xF9341880
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0xC2E49275
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0xA3E11142
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0x48E33530
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x5A482962
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x1CEB4B02

0xC2C4949F
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x4AD93CF0
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x0397EC54
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x2DB765B3
by the light of the lamps.
0x4F5A3338

0xC2C4949F
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x9028015E
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0xCAD55E98
instantly drove away.
0x2E41BC20

0xC2C4949F
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x7A19A244
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x9D84575B
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x2D6BF89A
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0xE767B338
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x79E4A4DE
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0xE2AFE4C7
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xC8447C92
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x508ECDA7
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0xE1F6D029

0xC2C4949F
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x8F97A631
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xAF538B31
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0xA8C3680B
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0xCFF68301
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0xFD584015
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x4197AE78
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x0C451740

0xC2C4949F
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0xBA13DDFE
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0x3C3DD4E3
grave, her bearing erect.
0x592871E4

0xC2C4949F
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0xD0C3F9E9
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x031D1DCA
then further added--
0xEB5B420C

0xC2C4949F
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0x279F8A27
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x0FC45BB3

0xC2C4949F
"A little, ma'am."
0x3F77ABEC

0xC2C4949F
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0xA925FFC2
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0x756B41F0
come to school, my little girl?"
0x3796ED1A

0xC2C4949F
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0xFD63EF45
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0xD6F5AF3E
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x37003D0A
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x37AEEBB6
me along with Miss Miller.
0x0632F261

0xC2C4949F
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x8A7D2405
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0xE2C5FC45
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0xFDE19DF5
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x2BD69CB4
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0xEE1CEB79
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xD5E1FDD9
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0xC166928A
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x08FD956F
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0xB637ADC3
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0xD03E7B82
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x95AF7A6A
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x513B954A
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x6DD06F1B
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0xA9C61EA4
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0xA3D453D7
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x08905512
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0xA2AF85C5
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x4B56DD36

0xC2C4949F
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0xD208E4E4
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x309A3AB3

0xC2C4949F
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0x8211F63C

0xC2C4949F
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xA56839A7
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0xF16AD7F5

0xC2C4949F
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0xA687B74C

0xC2C4949F
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x24994B10
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x9FB139E8
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xC2C8A417
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0xD7292698
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0xDB59E8E9
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x938FF1D2
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x6E2B2446

0xC2C4949F
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x0E9064E7
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0xE9FFAA3A
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0xC6A8E64C
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0xB88E577D
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x08BEC39C
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0xBA9523E2
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x9C1DCCE0
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x33B41030

0xC2C4949F
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0xAAE755C1
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x45B7C871
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x33B5C4FA
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x348B8285
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0xFDE3C2BC
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x4EC78CDB
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0xBF369A20
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x2ECB2059
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0xED4F1392
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0xF6A5B8D3
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x568A7B29
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x2C064077

0xC2C4949F
"Form classes!"
0x242BC9FB

0xC2C4949F
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0xEF6B899A
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x8FBA2ABB
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0xDD21F08C
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xAE6ED77F
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0xD7C49C21
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0x56FDAC89
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x5A8FEC7C

0xC2C4949F
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x8FFD30F9
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x3BAFAEBD
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0xF8249731
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xA59A1BE8
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0xB0AFAB0C

0xC2C4949F
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x66613F86
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0x105FE963
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x1FE442BC
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0xB294D344
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x8A3C8AC2
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0xF8761A9C
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x39FAEFE6
little the day before.
0x474D9AE8

0xC2C4949F
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x7E942467
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0x13738F42
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0x027E8719
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x786A5DAC
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0xDAA38134
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x30031755

0xC2C4949F
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x29BA62E5

0xC2C4949F
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x60CA92D1
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x586A6EBD
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xF0812F0B
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x523D9198
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0xBBCFB27D
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x5E146323
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0xCA888D37
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x8C91BD65
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0xB5A76F4E
the meal began.
0xC0FE1310

0xC2C4949F
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0x3FD70051
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x5896452F
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x0569C2C4
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0x885DD025
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xF6FFB658
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x6B58D7AE
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x3D7DE0A9
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0x306FA601
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0xE94ACADE
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0xBD7B419C
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x1F40664E
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x63D03FC6

0xC2C4949F
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x451ED377

0xC2C4949F
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x8B04E237
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0xEBF0BFCB
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xF23A8ACE
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x3C1D1827
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x2A80DFD3
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0xC30EB2D8
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0xD22A9DF3
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x2C3CDEDC
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x61934712
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0xCE72989E

0xC2C4949F
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x49E0DF93
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x3F149F52

0xC2C4949F
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x1C875896

0xC2C4949F
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xFF704A9A
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x007C2DA6
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0xA40FCA4E
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0xF5A2EEC6
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x5DB6D05D
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x687A1A82
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xD4A6DC5D
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x2550CBBA
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0x008A6D6F
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x6D52E18D
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0x345C07CF
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xEC5BEDC4
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0xA8A99149

0xC2C4949F
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x522900E2
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x4ABB5184
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x10529EF6
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x573701E8
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0xBCFB02BF
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0xBCDD59E4

0xC2C4949F
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x5C420ABB
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0xEF6BBA15
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0xE73B4C61
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x065B38B6
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0x880EE7BC
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x4008E3BF
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0xE107CFF7
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0xA09F20B3

0xC2C4949F
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x7F1EAA74

0xC2C4949F
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x98D51BEC
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0x75202B2C
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x84F9AF88
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0xC5BEB233
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0xB5B19687
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xB35A57A8
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x7945E6A0
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x60F0007B
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0x2E322FDD
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x87088944
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x1825071C
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0x6EAD716A
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0x4FBFCCDD
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x6789A626
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0xB915422E
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x924855D6

0xC2C4949F
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0xD68FFBF8
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0x3BA18915
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x3912EF83
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0xEF09AF1B
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x13F1E557
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x720A9945
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xBEF4386F
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x0BDD7ACF

0xC2C4949F
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0x6284775D

0xC2C4949F
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0xC7EBD416
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0xCA45D70C

0xC2C4949F
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x8C11614C
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x3B29267D
to all."
0x7FECCB09

0xC2C4949F
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0xF6E27678

0xC2C4949F
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0xA2F631D6
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xDB5F274F

0xC2C4949F
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x9CA6CCD6
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x618ECA04
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x675EFF4F
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x292F03F3
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0xE46EA97E

0xC2C4949F
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0xE274E49F
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x587A97ED
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x0CFAE1C3
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0x16EF95ED
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0x6C2C05FA
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0x14AFB1A3
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xBB2F9532
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0xA0A38D76
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xAD0BBC27
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0xEF881830
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0x356F2C7A
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0xDF6C507B
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0x86F479A9
hollow cough.
0x858DA49A

0xC2C4949F
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0xA78C4B7D
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0x73A198F7
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x64D238EF
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0xE38B5545
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0x40F9EEC2
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0xC25F6689
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x6AAD2CF8
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x9D53FC63
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x3C087672
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x698C7E28
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0x415B0CAE
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x4A7E3C9C
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0x13C3763B
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0x46BD0C23
this inscription:--
0x55F67DBD

0xC2C4949F
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0x228EC6F2
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x385027F8
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0xFCE7F257
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x0CE83F57

0xC2C4949F
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x074F9714
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x36167C7A
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x31EFED75
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0x18057BB7
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x2A75D6D4
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0xDE5CD9D1
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x7AD5B034
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0x49580EFB
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0xE65C0D48
I said to her directly--
0x3C18A9D6

0xC2C4949F
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0xBBCD78EE
her to lend it to me some day.
0x37E9C39A

0xC2C4949F
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x67C8A73F
she examined me.
0x8C6D961B

0xC2C4949F
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0xFE6E0B8F
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x7D244F09
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x02A219E4
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x10D2CB74
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0xE8639040
or substantial.
0x7DE42B56

0xC2C4949F
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0xFC14DA45

0xC2C4949F
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0x9A4C7854
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x6FDE3DF2
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x2AB1B05D
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0xBCCA1964
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x2961AE82
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0x7E0F36EB

0xC2C4949F
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0x482F650E
is Lowood Institution?"
0x1EC45F65

0xC2C4949F
"This house where you are come to live."
0xD9E54EBD

0xC2C4949F
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0xDAB50BE3
other schools?"
0xDF9DF8F9

0xC2C4949F
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0x7501B537
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x32F48940
father or your mother dead?"
0x6BFBE849

0xC2C4949F
"Both died before I can remember."
0x7FAE80DC

0xC2C4949F
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0x06BB491C
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0x9AFBBDBD

0xC2C4949F
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0xD27944F1

0xC2C4949F
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0xC37A4AFB

0xC2C4949F
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0x977F2E0C

0xC2C4949F
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0xF8E27533
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0x8340AD07

0xC2C4949F
"Who subscribes?"
0x4843BA02

0xC2C4949F
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0x476AC839
and in London."
0xAF49EE55

0xC2C4949F
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0xE36A9E4B

0xC2C4949F
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0x31244D86
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0x5826158F

0xC2C4949F
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0xC2C4949F
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x309F0C40

0xC2C4949F
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x4A91DE6C
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0x5C79CBD8

0xC2C4949F
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0x67EDDDAA
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x5CF70696
all our clothes."
0x8BD95AFB

0xC2C4949F
"Does he live here?"
0x2EF53D5A

0xC2C4949F
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0x89900876

0xC2C4949F
"Is he a good man?"
0x079B0E4D

0xC2C4949F
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0x43898FA7

0xC2C4949F
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0x1852B076

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0x2E19D942

0xC2C4949F
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0x9BC6B3C8
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0x7D9C5394
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0x0851A169
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0xBA0FAA31
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0x53580F0C
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0x9B6A26B0
teaches French."
0x50D6CBDB

0xC2C4949F
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x5060ED53

0xC2C4949F
"Well enough."
0x2476EFE4

0xC2C4949F
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x9AD4C047
pronounce her name as you do."
0xF1C7BBCE

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0xB331EE25
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0xED3DFB61

0xC2C4949F
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x33CFCA2A

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0x2D4984F4
she knows far more than they do."
0xED039592

0xC2C4949F
"Have you been long here?"
0x2EFF20D8

0xC2C4949F
"Two years."
0x2811F6A2

0xC2C4949F
"Are you an orphan?"
0x128B2DF5

0xC2C4949F
"My mother is dead."
0xED5B7602

0xC2C4949F
"Are you happy here?"
0xB2E889FE

0xC2C4949F
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0xD6A4580C
the present: now I want to read."
0xB6285029

0xC2C4949F
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xF96157B4
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x3705DD8C
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0xB480D860
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x1BAE8575
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x1CEF32DF
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0xA7680E64
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0xBB5573D6
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x8E6711F8
day's fare would be like this.
0xF37FD963

0xC2C4949F
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0xC089BFE6
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0xB628BD08

0xC2C4949F
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0xADF3A8ED
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x1B9AD84D
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x3A266A99
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x336D1B7E
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x769C56E7
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x31A4631B
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x75982C70
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0xC54B7510
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x672F567B
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0x563701E9
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x770F3A59
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x4A0AB814
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xBC761E5B
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0xE43A2DF2
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x427043AD
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0x4984D82A

0xC2C4949F
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xF7FB3DB6
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xCB2C8DA6
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0xB4F5439B
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x2EDAEC7E
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x0A153BA6
first day at Lowood.
0x335D4206

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER VI
0x1CD968EE

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0xDC2E4BCC
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0x3F7E3E05
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0x7325DCED
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x20818EAE
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x58876832
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0x7C5E7DB2

0xC2C4949F
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x4FFD29AC
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0xA1AA0B03
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x15BA5C80
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0x3AC5BF24

0xC2C4949F
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x5E25D2E9
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x15D21251
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x2059BB01
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0x1A81395B
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0xCF4DF760
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x39405BDB
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0xA1F8D035
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x9B72B696
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x478B74C4
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x07CD4370
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x6664FD32
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0xE6DCB285
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0xF77CA0F3
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x803EC660
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x85C9B78E
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x33C217CA
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xDD9A8639
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x0E6A7BD4
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x77DA4198
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x8070DF9F

0xC2C4949F
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x641EE634
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xD51D7E85
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x647F3065
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0xE594374F
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0xCABA614B
&c. &c.
0x7ED3D79A

0xC2C4949F
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x41D1F64F
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x0A027280
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0xED82AFFB
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0x2D14DC27
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x47AC231A
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xB26E4824
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0xFF245B86
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x67770F7E

0xC2C4949F
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0xA573F93B
morning!"
0x5D2C3B79

0xC2C4949F
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x2F49699A
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x32B28487
as the water was frozen?"
0x68F6EEF8

0xC2C4949F
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xBFCB600D
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x82996440
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0xE0A5B622
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0xA313A52E
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0xD9DB40CE
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0x19FEF59C
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x5D676596
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x461729FB
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0x2DA6E247
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0x88338A1B
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0x1D2006FA
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0xD79A734F
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0xB337E490
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0xEB7ED7DB
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x58F20E26
altered its ordinary expression.
0x12E5A02C

0xC2C4949F
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x9C0D4EC0
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0xF74629EE

0xC2C4949F
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x4503770A
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x82454BAD
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x6CBC97B5

0xC2C4949F
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x974C1E28
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0x9574B8BF
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x4D68A5E1
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x080D1542
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x5768B72C
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0xF10BEC8C
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x0C97DBA5
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0x76235101

0xC2C4949F
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x59B736FB
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x4CDE36FE
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0x019BCA16
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0xD7543923
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0x1219137F
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x91435F0A
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x40BFFE3A

0xC2C4949F
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0xCDC6546E
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x1FB2C696
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x9E652DD8
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x09F736D6
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x8ABA1BDC
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xAD09C1D1
to clamour.
0x0179694A

0xC2C4949F
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x950D77E7
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x5688D4C1
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0xE016C774
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0xC051DD95

0xC2C4949F
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x8571BCE7

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x6286B095

0xC2C4949F
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x56A20147
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0xBB2D0025
floor.
0xFFDDE07C

0xC2C4949F
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x7ECE497C

0xC2C4949F
"Helen."
0x1EEBE297

0xC2C4949F
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0xF303997A

0xC2C4949F
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x23E58764

0xC2C4949F
"Will you ever go back?"
0x5AE46C24

0xC2C4949F
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x1939DC6E

0xC2C4949F
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x0F086A0F

0xC2C4949F
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x7C0C8BAB
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x4F0D40C4

0xC2C4949F
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0xD5A91484

0xC2C4949F
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0xF0859022

0xC2C4949F
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0xA26F799D
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x68719D6D
break it under her nose."
0x8C5382E9

0xC2C4949F
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x253C537A
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0xE17FF443
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0xCAF7C77C
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x59C43C97
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x56882BEA
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0xDFF6E603

0xC2C4949F
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0x76D45489
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0x0FCE0DFD
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0x343178DF

0xC2C4949F
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x8732A2DF
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0xC837EBF0
required to bear."
0x38D206B3

0xC2C4949F
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0x7EA731C9
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x043CB587
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x948C3A50
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x4EBB45E7
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x78891848
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0xBBA46416

0xC2C4949F
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0x494EBBED
good."
0xB76B9A58

0xC2C4949F
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0xF0EB3F7F
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x384A6C33
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xE397F239
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x1A0757E2
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x6208B293
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0x10EF2D40

0xC2C4949F
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0xB566FC98
addition: she kept silence.
0x223A76AC

0xC2C4949F
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0xB75DA421

0xC2C4949F
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x91F389F4
grave face.
0x293D327F

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x7DECEB1D
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x8498836D
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x9FD1A928
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x75656E2C
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0x63E1059C
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0x9FDE6E20
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0x576A2D0C

0xC2C4949F
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x0A663359

0xC2C4949F
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0x229167C6
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0x9F04F779
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xE7892886
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0xFD07BA26
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xB94DDA56
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x6EF58DFF
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0x7AE63553
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x7A2D6031
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0xE5F4F013
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x6515C07D
answer ready."
0x51BD9836

0xC2C4949F
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0xD29F1506

0xC2C4949F
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0x251FC92A
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0xFC533366
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x58FEBA4F
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x47C74A43
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0xAEFCD93B
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x80D746A6
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x427ABBD2
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0x7A098A34
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0xB2E3DF35
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0xDEAA58FE

0xC2C4949F
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0xD53BE46E
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x52C5A128
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0xCC0B02F4

0xC2C4949F
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0x579B3E6D

0xC2C4949F
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x35030101
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x85D0A78F
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x19110CB1
I wished to gain."
0x5595F19F

0xC2C4949F
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0x380C29E1

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0xB18E1D52
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0x733CC073

0xC2C4949F
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0xA67ADB95
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x539C4BF3
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0xC03FBEE1
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0x9FDA8DE2
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x7D1B2E4A
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x791B4BCF
person who struck us never to do it again."
0x951864AB

0xC2C4949F
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0x2A1E4469
but a little untaught girl."
0x405EB56B

0xC2C4949F
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x952EABF9
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0xE17F151D
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0xC8889570
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0xEF6B0E3B

0xC2C4949F
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0x4E944A41
civilised nations disown it."
0xD593BA10

0xC2C4949F
"How?  I don't understand."
0xEAAF2913

0xC2C4949F
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0xB17B601D
certainly heals injury."
0x890118F0

0xC2C4949F
"What then?"
0x494D9948

0xC2C4949F
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0x4884E083
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0x3B5EE564

0xC2C4949F
"What does He say?"
0x22B47D9F

0xC2C4949F
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0x093AA1D3
you and despitefully use you."
0xB9057386

0xC2C4949F
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0xF31CBF17
John, which is impossible."
0x230052D2

0xC2C4949F
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0xC73E08B5
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0xC22146B6
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x8CD4023A
softening.
0x4B8E79C0

0xC2C4949F
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0xBCE662B0
remark, but she said nothing.
0xD51A5CAF

0xC2C4949F
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0xE98E8E62
woman?"
0x2B2C96B4

0xC2C4949F
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0x02E0AD67
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0xE6D85CA3
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x0B6CD73F
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x93C868F6
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0x2DAB7A44
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0x60545F6C
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x76EDA36C
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x453B3EC4
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x39683F77
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0x7148FAFC
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x20A966EE
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x9DA81747
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x76BDE8E0
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0xD31034CF
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0x9D13CC37
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x73A9343B
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0x6562861D
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x99AB32DF
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0x5173E6DC
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xBE5A59AC
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0x14046540
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0xC7EABE96
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0x1591761D
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x9EF453CD
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x93030CE2

0xC2C4949F
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0xE9738402
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xFBCE3C43
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0xBF85B6A4
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0xCB898AE1
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0xC3F97240

0xC2C4949F
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x1F1FD45A
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x8CE436CC

0xC2C4949F
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x2C699C89
without reply as without delay.
0xEA1BD853

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER VII
0x807AB650

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0xEDD122CF
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x2BC93736
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x003E3F4A
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x1453F042
were no trifles.
0x78AA6EEF

0xC2C4949F
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0x060552D0
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x4176EAC5
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x458BE6B0
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x75154718
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0xB9C3F202
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x4CA01A69
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x2D2ED597
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x06175968
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0xF1311F3D
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x30E3C1C6
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0xCF6A123E
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0x6DA1F34F
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0xB68CA0B5
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x999DDBED
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xEA17BE28
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x4B7EE311
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x50D62C85
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x3BB3D354
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x7F69065E

0xC2C4949F
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x71E5D680
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0x28576F19
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x79249D12
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x6F6EEE29
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x91F89C09
meals, was served round between the services.
0x441C5282

0xC2C4949F
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x678D2765
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xB55570E8
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x9486E883

0xC2C4949F
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x9C33CC6F
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0x1BD3255D
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x921771BF
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x5B50EAE6
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x89FE6F25
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0xBB19602F

0xC2C4949F
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0x955DF819
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x7FE77C94
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0xBFEAF9DD
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0x26C6B829
starved arms in their pinafores.
0xBD777695

0xC2C4949F
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0xA03B6FA2
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x37DBAD45
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0x5786786A
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x703E782F
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0xEC4B43E5
invariably obliged to part with.
0xA6A733AE

0xC2C4949F
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0xE3943869
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x1B3BB8FF
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0x22E88504
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0xE2C7CD0D
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x6D539CDB
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x95C7A8FF
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x41003874
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x7E1281F5
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0xE034165D
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0xB0B52540
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xE1418663

0xC2C4949F
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x25AF9AE6
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0x04C1E7FB
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0xB4F9EAD6
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x9FA8964B
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x84F05D20

0xC2C4949F
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xC10A1D47
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0x90218137
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x69DCA3FC
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x39D22CA9
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0xCD44137C
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x13490B8A
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x2D0B05BB
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0xA5331590
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0x94767212
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0xD4572979
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x24D4309F
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0xE4080820

0xC2C4949F
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0x8275C872
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x47BDE676
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0xEB37C980
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xFEA7E2C3
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0xF13C2A3E
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x471DCAFD
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x1877CEA1

0xC2C4949F
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x2031B7DD
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x9A504CE0
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x19F12E1C
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xB343BF38
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x0A025E71
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xDDD02C53

0xC2C4949F
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0xC0EABB0F
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x0E54BE47
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x8C42837C
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x0751C962
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xE02056CC
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x5D6674E0
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x90EF310F
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0xA03B5C35
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x8602844A
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0xD2B746F5
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0xFCB653F0

0xC2C4949F
He paused.
0x14C3B008

0xC2C4949F
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x10B4179E

0xC2C4949F
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xEB75CF0B
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0xB32B3967
to one."
0x7795CA07

0xC2C4949F
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x64C7557B
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0xB12EE5DE
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x64851DF2
occasion."
0xCEA67F40

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x5EFDBF62

0xC2C4949F
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0x52E2C41D
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x590DD651
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x88808D2E
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x267898C2
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0xA47E68AC
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0x7F9509AF
what authority?"
0x8C97B041

0xC2C4949F
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0x57361540
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x0127765A
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0xF1C572B2

0xC2C4949F
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x8A5E4AAD
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0xB5CF5DD1
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x7042913E
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0xC87C6665
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0x94D24E70
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0x146B3DD3
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0xEA9A3D8D
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0xAFF8F92C
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0x303F2E69
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0x4E6AA81D
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x4D419CE2
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xA8F8B366
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0xCC1BB99A
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x14CEAAF1
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0x921CB3CC
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x27678302
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0xBFC6BFD8
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0xEEA18E75
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x5DB9E0EC

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x123B6C8D
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x9CFE5797
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x153501BD
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x35AA69FD
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0xDC614B33
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x2D17C864
severity.
0x13CC9004

0xC2C4949F
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xB5A64723
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x5EE90411
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x43881095
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xB4C4A5AB

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0x279558E9
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x818F2D71
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x74D1124D

0xC2C4949F
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0xBF00DF1D

0xC2C4949F
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x82946F29
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x26529BD8
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xC5DFC844
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x61F51748

0xC2C4949F
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x7589B40C

0xC2C4949F
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0xB65AE7D3
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x067FC115
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x909D5C0D
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x193F2874
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x28B7A30F
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0xC5A32A73
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0xC9EC6E91

0xC2C4949F
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x313DA84B
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x27F2FF43
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x3D773203
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0xF0ACF348
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0xC6B54448
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0x0C7ECAC5
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0xBCE46D6A
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0xFA643892

0xC2C4949F
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x56BDE50B
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0x704E7706

0xC2C4949F
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x7C694D4A

0xC2C4949F
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0x2E448E44

0xC2C4949F
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xFF7173C7
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x342FBCBB
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0xE0379BD8
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xF458177E
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x7EF1119B
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x9A0128A4
time wasted, of--"
0x5AEC0DF7

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x4870B369
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0xFF1B5905
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x0ACA06D0
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x516A7537
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x9E3E7E7C
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0xD8194E35
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x751983A3
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x385F41AD
false front of French curls.
0x8F6D6B31

0xC2C4949F
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x71C52F38
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x09BFA7AB
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x2025A007
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0xE640E01C
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x8EC2E89F
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0xF90F0F6B
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x19A12641
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0xFF08E597
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0xF1A598B8
my attention.
0xFB0CDC01

0xC2C4949F
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x820E647F
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x6701D0D3
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0xC8ECC6DE
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xC8A88F82
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x5A65A468
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x511D3D7B
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0x15C5039E
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0x5D3B2ED9
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0xF1EE4D18
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x421CCE3B

0xC2C4949F
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x226DBEDC
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0xB04EB2AC
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x993F7C57
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0xD8452271

0xC2C4949F
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x701EB1DD
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0xBD40CF94
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x908C552C
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0x3E06D997

0xC2C4949F
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0xC7A70359
punished."
0xED7C03C7

0xC2C4949F
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x141F3F10

0xC2C4949F
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x7B218EA4
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x29062E65
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x9ADABF68

0xC2C4949F
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0xEC454330
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x7C54280D

0xC2C4949F
"Place the child upon it."
0xE765C916

0xC2C4949F
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x2C12ADD3
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x4930D88D
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0x1EE33B49
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x48F16291
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0xDCFE51CD

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x477E2EF8

0xC2C4949F
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x6377D653
children, you all see this girl?"
0x1590A7EC

0xC2C4949F
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x0FDB6A26
against my scorched skin.
0x30CEC7C8

0xC2C4949F
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x2A94F20C
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x2D52EACE
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0xD200E821
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0xD8DF0A14
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x89EF6B1C

0xC2C4949F
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xCF87134B
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0x717A4C9E
must be firmly sustained.
0xF0B02CD3

0xC2C4949F
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0x109D583C
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x35EC84E3
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0xDE8C40E5
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xDDF6DB17
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0xA9325500
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0xAF9F5961
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x9B42B29A
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x370C73B5
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xF303A79B
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x6363979B
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0xA8BF1FA0
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x1ABC6240

0xC2C4949F
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0xE7AFEEC2
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x68256CC2
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x923B6292
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x9ACBD5C1
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xB6E08F01

0xC2C4949F
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x0BA5C986
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0xCAEA7E4C
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xA2A26FB8
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0x126B74FB
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x161BE00C
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x41FB73CD
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x5A3F6ACB
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0xBCC0036F
waters to stagnate round her."
0x3D1B3096

0xC2C4949F
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x05AC0962
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0xFA859A03
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x0E3AE610
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x8A1E8918

0xC2C4949F
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x332EE97A
her during the remainder of the day."
0x1AED3FA6

0xC2C4949F
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x85316836
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x7B62704A
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x117BEFF3
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0xA19758D7
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x67AD7D09
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x66B1284E
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xD3758C83
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0x7503A777
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0xDA254EC7
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x21523A66
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x8A245BD5
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x2F4FA734
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x02563A37
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x5464282D
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x1A1625F2
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x5AD91784
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0xC6217325
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0x3DC51E2D
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x8AFFB08F
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xB1C9579A
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0xBD75A136
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0x7947BE42

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0xB507C2A1
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x8F0103D8
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x56A80B44
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x25ED0011
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x637946BF
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xD59FF722
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x9E7EF3AA
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x672425AE
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x8B867DC1
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0x35C73CFF
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x0226A896
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0xD3AAE4A2
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0xF8DBDE95
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x82FB2A9A
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0xD834708F
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0x1A74C7B0

0xC2C4949F
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x40908BE5
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x1A178B50
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0xD67818BE
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x43E6C03E

0xC2C4949F
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x0EE34A06
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0xCC09BC82
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x982A6EF7
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x057CFC6F
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0x616DCA43
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0xAE2B2F91
first who spoke--
0x8234A091

0xC2C4949F
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xB5654DEA
liar?"
0x53A400EB

0xC2C4949F
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0xDA899E28
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x10C6864B

0xC2C4949F
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xF55EC968

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x579D24A3
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0x618009F4

0xC2C4949F
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x3959D95A

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x0707A82E
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0xF191DEA2
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0xB31C17A0
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x30B48A1C
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0x4A583603
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x44940D40
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x47693D4F
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0xF42FEFBE
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x7A872174

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0xE108999A
gently to warm them, and went on--
0x2BACFF5B

0xC2C4949F
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x694DDB8A
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x13EE86C6
without friends."
0xE5DA1EDA

0xC2C4949F
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x32CEBA61
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x356E7FB2
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0x26EC6C0A
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x6F0DF83B
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x52D92EFC
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x5335FF2D

0xC2C4949F
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x354F1EE0
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x071215F5
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x43DF865E
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0xC4F1B0D3
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x5524E43C
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x04F06878
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x5A87E351
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0x6383F96E
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0xB02AD381
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x472C66BF
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0xAD623324
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0xD0B61932
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x373DDFEC
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0x20B807CB
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xB29EB0E3

0xC2C4949F
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0xEB9312C4
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x0858AA75
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0x7569DC3E
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0xD9224A92
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x410DFE0C

0xC2C4949F
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0xEC574555
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x258A939E
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x72CDB4F7
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0x71CCC232
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0xC8261666
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x6E19565D

0xC2C4949F
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0x0B3AC441
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x369A3685

0xC2C4949F
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x4DC509D0
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x3734635B
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xC8501A27
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x58B2A133
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x2BB313EC

0xC2C4949F
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0xDC6083C1
your grief away?"
0xE97BADD4

0xC2C4949F
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0x6719A97C

0xC2C4949F
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0xC2C4949F
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0xD79F8106
will now think me wicked."
0xE083E03E

0xC2C4949F
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x4B2F11BA
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0x3E2560C8

0xC2C4949F
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x878DEF1A

0xC2C4949F
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xE1F7DAF6
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x8E13CCF2

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0xDF6AD666
care."
0x05FCCCE7

0xC2C4949F
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0xAB4A5D6F

0xC2C4949F
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0x8E5486B1
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0xE9FCC99B
always keep me."
0xF4562DA6

0xC2C4949F
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0x14E3FD2A
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x7A32E450
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x6C041791
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0xE2EA2188
exaggerate nothing."
0x8A326417

0xC2C4949F
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0xD2AEC787
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0x727E0ECA
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0xB5B28610
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0xF027A128
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0xCF511830
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x1DB18F07
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xB8C87C71
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x848F0B0F
Temple fully believed me.
0xBA684D94

0xC2C4949F
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0x5C9F75CD
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xF80E6D66
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x4B598A04
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x3A9F0CA2
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x88F84839
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x015410B1

0xC2C4949F
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x30A8833D
then said--
0xFB0E065C

0xC2C4949F
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0xF8C42290
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x22295BE3
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x66C38671

0xC2C4949F
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x21E54C1C
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0xE65058A0
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x998ECF9B
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0xAAE58FEB
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xB468B609

0xC2C4949F
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x7E80D9F2

0xC2C4949F
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x305E03FA

0xC2C4949F
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x20C526C2

0xC2C4949F
"It is a little better."
0x1795710F

0xC2C4949F
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x7580D52E
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xB27800A3
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0x45BA84C7

0xC2C4949F
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xE501D88E
rang her bell.
0x98A973F3

0xC2C4949F
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x283730ED
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x6AEEFF71

0xC2C4949F
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0x6BB1F8B3
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x24B32188
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x2E20F066
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x650C690D
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0xBEBAB5F0

0xC2C4949F
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xA9C6B658
There is not enough for three."
0x5894A57B

0xC2C4949F
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0x38E61DE7

0xC2C4949F
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0xEA9E5162

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0xB8AF3C73
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x172CEF91

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x6BADE876
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0xA6B8C0C6
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0xF41857E5

0xC2C4949F
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x4E7035BC
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xD0153E57
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x8903F783
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x1A892EBC

0xC2C4949F
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0xE989B3C8
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x6797C82D
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0xC45D600D

0xC2C4949F
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x6421B02B
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x7C088290
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0xFAD99B9E
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0xA9673650

0xC2C4949F
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xFFB89715
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0xD08B0050
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0x3D2828FD

0xC2C4949F
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x67F3EB63
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x54220386
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0xFB68BED1
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x2353C2C6
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0xF66F38F2
struck with wonder.
0xDEB52165

0xC2C4949F
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x2FF71FEB
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x74DBD950
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0x98CAD592
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0xA0EA2FB8
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0xDBE7DD81
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0xB881D3CF
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x7DAFE598
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0xF9BAB90B
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x7FB28644
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x7AE305CB
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xE2D3127F
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0x2D5DB999
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0xC73BD5AC
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x70E944A2

0xC2C4949F
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x54495ACF
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x9AC4DCA2
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x0DD5A963
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0xCAF41EC1
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x5C4A459B
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xAE196DFB
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x94AE6971
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x241F05E1
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x382C4805
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xF9006560
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x324DF4D9

0xC2C4949F
"God bless you, my children!"
0xDEBFC1A1

0xC2C4949F
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0xECBA6091
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x5D0DB7D6
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x683265C4

0xC2C4949F
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x73B3A713
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x740E640C
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0xE85916DC
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x8AFC08CF
shoulder.
0x628F76B6

0xC2C4949F
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0xAFEF47C3
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x4E3CAD59

0xC2C4949F
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x4791DF93
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x3A333EB2
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x6437C16C
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x356E5286
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x2AD07679
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0xA9B5CFCE
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x494E82B3
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x35385084
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0xFFCA5F51

0xC2C4949F
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x134D7F62
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x5BF64D66
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x32CB91AE
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0xEDC01759
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xD34E630D
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x1A688B51
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x9C7FDFA4
through the ranks of my companions.
0x592AD24E

0xC2C4949F
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x381E029F
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0xC650F65A
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0xFFDCB685
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x67F68D29
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x490F72A2
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0xC8CC5CBA
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x1EED0290
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x0B581560
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x553A8725
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x1157F3D6
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x69C5F5EE
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x9523FF18
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0xA9215276
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x4CA29C65
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0x28623C62
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0xC1CF85A0
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xD6FE52EF
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x1D2D3DED
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x362B9A94
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.

Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a

0xC2C4949F
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0x6FDC66FB
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER IX
0x068C7B94

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x49C942E6
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0xF04AC524
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xAE4BF45F
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x88050B2F
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0xE52AF04A
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x9B4E4585
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x2EF2289D
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x1D0266E5
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x89FFE106
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x36BC99D2
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x19F53D61
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x9AE867AE
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x06DB43F7
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x9547A862

0xC2C4949F
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xC90C2209
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x10147372
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0xC93FCBB6
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x7FCDFD49
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x8167201E
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x75B41D08
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x1B9BFD01
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0x08712889
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x9F07E2F8
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0xBF946792
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x0D6A81E8
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x982B610B
of skeletons.
0x782CB9BE

0xC2C4949F
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x8A2A03B0
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x429D6B5A
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0xB4D15FDE
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x13FAC87E
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0xF3032056
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xFBE8086C
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0xF63B9452
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xF0D6BA0B
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0xF2405848
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x4CC675F3
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x2669DBF3
advert.
0x3EFDA5DD

0xC2C4949F
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0xF8C46EB7
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0xA4EE25C1
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0x79B7BE6C
question.
0xCDD29F68

0xC2C4949F
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x182D9F12
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xA528D128
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x7872C23C
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x4215C107
hospital.
0xDCEC5285

0xC2C4949F
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0xCB061211
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0xB0475BE4
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x6BCF7A58
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0x3395BB33
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x683B8969
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0xEA6BEC26
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x7CED85E0
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0xDB3A269C
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x7B4C8AF2
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x38D33374
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xA9437967
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0xBB64A2DF
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xF2B07D03
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x8FC5E5AF

0xC2C4949F
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x5F9A2AF7
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x5875E913
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0xB1265D60
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0xDD3AD347
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0x7F204A76
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0x81D09B56
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0xA535CC90
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0x0902EB70
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0xBC9D9D2F
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x861E82DE
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xBA8DECDD
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xD1313D41

0xC2C4949F
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x09DFEDFD
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x4CB1E503
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x20ED236E
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x595B5267
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xF7E4BAEA
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0xE4540757
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x507B362E
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0xEF99C62A
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x8DC8BF32
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x334C7CD2
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x16B98B6E
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0xABC49B02
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x07E0820D

0xC2C4949F
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x73F763CA
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x570D1617
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xC4EC49C4
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x68F9197E
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xBEC4F89F
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xE58B34EA
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x6F3FDDF2
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x1C0A6796
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0xFA924B1B
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x9523D16D
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x44C35E65
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x6ECFF7B0
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0xF2A2CD12

0xC2C4949F
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0xA8FFF00E
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xAFACB8DD
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x1FFA92F7
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x743B8BF7
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0xF3AD0825
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0xF958356A
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x8F6164DD
higher things.
0x8FB680D8

0xC2C4949F
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x060165C7
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0x393277B6
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x6289D813
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0xB045935A
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x9796031D
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0x5D06039A
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x200E37CA
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xBBC01373
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x0EDBB9EE
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x5A8E649B
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x6158300C
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x000636DF
alleviate.
0xD7802934

0xC2C4949F
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0xBBEB356E
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x8F502C54
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0xB0896025
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0xB608CAE3
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0xEB757B56
verandah.
0x5BBA23D0

0xC2C4949F
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x7826EA70
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0xB0EDD995
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0xE25DCCA9
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x2008B1B5
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0xBD821757
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x5A2F737C
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0xE1203968
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0xD7FD3625
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x2ADB921F
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x7AA32CC0
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x673A0273
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x786FACB3
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0x43AE0F2B
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x95767201
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x21AD2CAB
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x2006BE81
done before:--
0xF0E35746

0xC2C4949F
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x9D1157A0
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x501588BF
have to go who knows where?"
0x62EEE1D5

0xC2C4949F
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x1EE84D2E
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x8E63096B
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0xD93186E0
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0x4B58F9AD
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x7552FC02
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x7E26DDD0
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0xC69FA326
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x7722E7DD
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x94A561E8
ran up to her.
0xB3B7EDEC

0xC2C4949F
"How is Helen Burns?"
0x3E7E888D

0xC2C4949F
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0x10D1501D

0xC2C4949F
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x95A55F44

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"And what does he say about her?"
0x8AA4AC33

0xC2C4949F
"He says she'll not be here long."
0xBA523643

0xC2C4949F
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xA77AF600
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x845D7E67
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xD2C19EA0
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0xC43F408B
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0x7F776D83
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xBF0F84F3
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x46D0CDD6
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0xE0ACA63B

0xC2C4949F
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0x8F6CAB3F

0xC2C4949F
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x2A257CDF

0xC2C4949F
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0xDB1D793C
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0xF6CC56CA

0xC2C4949F
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x82653532
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0xE1950DBA
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xB8C9BA36

0xC2C4949F
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x22166DE4
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0xF392273C
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x919ADC83
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x960E3988
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0xADFC36A6
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x039257D6
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x099D25AF
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x36817A9A
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0x0CA43569
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0xD9C625E5
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x0695FCA5
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x2D234476
with her one last word.
0xD70A0F21

0xC2C4949F
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x22A05499
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0x92E5E9D0
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xFB15714C
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0x6DA46052
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x1E2898CB
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0x2D1795C8
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x8BA47424
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x2B5100D5
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0xACD06931

0xC2C4949F
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x5F421B08
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x275814A2
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0xB5B2E84E
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x75A91005
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xEF0FE907
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0xB4B3A49C
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x394C5745
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xFE3FB653
of seeing a corpse.
0x9A267031

0xC2C4949F
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xC65D368E

0xC2C4949F
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0xDA4F83C5
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x8D984954
instantly dissipated.
0x2D5D7C2B

0xC2C4949F
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xE177DB33

0xC2C4949F
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x0338F181
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0x295E0018

0xC2C4949F
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0xA806E751
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x5A30760F
old.
0x6F7651F2

0xC2C4949F
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0x25AC4A68
strike some minutes since."
0xD46F0E90

0xC2C4949F
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x5B414D79
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0x83F286B3

0xC2C4949F
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0x26FE3FC4

0xC2C4949F
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x3CE146F9

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x52837C85

0xC2C4949F
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0xE5015732
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0xFC2BD0C8
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0xB828E34E
whispered--
0xDF86FFCA

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x0E3F2452
quilt."
0x5478CD86

0xC2C4949F
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xE697DBEA
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0xCA316AF8

0xC2C4949F
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0x38D7E39F
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0xF9684929
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0xE6356958
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x3EC5B594
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xDA1FBCD6
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0xDD35118F
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xC8F76D97
been continually at fault."
0x9F672A94

0xC2C4949F
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0x7AB8C733

0xC2C4949F
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0xD11E915F

0xC2C4949F
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x086B60C8

0xC2C4949F
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0xBD40026F
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0xFC7B04F9
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0xF0CEE970
reveal Him to me."
0x5548D178

0xC2C4949F
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0xA086F454
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xE8C216A3

0xC2C4949F
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0x886AE5CD
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x6ADD0A80
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0x5EE8F583

0xC2C4949F
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x659F5082

0xC2C4949F
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0x10F2D6D0
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x5D59A3B9

0xC2C4949F
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x74FB56BE
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x1B6ED50C
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x1966CDFA
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0xEE8AED54
tone--
0x3AD49BFC

0xC2C4949F
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0x44D83E31
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0xCECE495B
near me."
0x0AC919AE

0xC2C4949F
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xD7E5819C

0xC2C4949F
"Are you warm, darling?"
0x31D5B77E

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Good-night, Jane."
0xC0B86F1B

0xC2C4949F
"Good-night, Helen."
0xE08A032C

0xC2C4949F
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0xB13FE22F

0xC2C4949F
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x22B24E3F
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x249614E0
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x865F3704
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0xD8FDC8F1
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0xB26C8CF9
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0xD8D7CE8D
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0xA09E2B5F
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0x5FB9FFCF

0xC2C4949F
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0x34EF9A68
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0xC0239D16
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER X
0x945B831F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0xF946A719
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x2E8F9547
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0xCA2FAEF7
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x9D9C0C1D
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x55EE6626
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x0E41D622
connection.
0x386F13A6

0xC2C4949F
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xEBF681C4
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x8E62B426
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0xF2DCE252
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x87FDE1C0
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0xB40478ED
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x5B0A6573
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x4A258059
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x7C418F60
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0x2B326AB1
beneficial to the institution.
0x3E736F51

0xC2C4949F
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0xF5760877
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x927CD882
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x76ACE605
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0xCFE35D1D
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0x1D581ACE
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0xCFE65CB2
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0xCD09649E
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0x2AA6978A
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0x3E2CF8DB
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x0294A2C8
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x255C50F6
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0x045BD707
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x26AE6B3E
testimony to its value and importance.
0x3F7CBBE6

0xC2C4949F
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xD3E644F1
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0xBB101C77
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0xEB2BA931
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x386E0F00
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0xFDAE5AED
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0xD7BE73E4
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0x623D2348
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xFCE86746

0xC2C4949F
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x5B7B2592
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x5A6BE3E3
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x25188DAD
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xCFAAF1B4
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0xDF25590A
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x41181681
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xCA5810C2

0xC2C4949F
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x1873B70C
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x62CB822B
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0xAAB005B1
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x7EAE2AA8
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xB18CE482
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0xF9F5550D
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0xBF1E2D52
character.
0xEE2C4C5E

0xC2C4949F
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x56AFF9BE
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x70022301
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x7E8C585E
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0x17841D5F
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0xDB1A1C14
of the occasion.
0xEA3AC729

0xC2C4949F
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x76730ABB
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x69F026C5
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x4B65E8A8
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0x255AC1CD
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x1257E596
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x6DC5C317
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x7F20DD22
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0xFE362242
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x970E02A6
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xA6362E34
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xA3E127D3
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x2D63CF63
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x3577D59A
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x8DEFEAF6
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x5F7938BE
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x798F0E26

0xC2C4949F
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0x81B6AFEB
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x0A0AA097
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x19C57FED
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x7541F3D2
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x57ED1180
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x58E5DA92
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x7AB846FB
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0xCA6B3411
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0xE25FC264
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0xFAD11A81
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0x377AB2AB
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x50249A39
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0x85CB3177
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xE4A258A9
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x3705930F
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0xEE665505
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x3CA13B7F
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0xEE9010BD
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xF9511616
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0xF3E6F74A
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0xF325EDFA
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xD9120365

0xC2C4949F
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0xDCA21928

0xC2C4949F
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x12DDCD59
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0xD17CF494
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x6D1E3433
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x4BCA01D3
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x069EA4D8
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x2EF1C8F8

0xC2C4949F
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x2B6ACFA5
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0x24473F56
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0xEF8DF49F
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0xF0A95E81
instantly revived.
0x96005B94

0xC2C4949F
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0xACAE2F3F
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x12EA5AE2
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0xBB24E835
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0xFBCD85CF
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x810F084F
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0xE8DF1747
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0x5036A9BB
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x2D3B22C0
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0x7AEC28EE
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0xA443271C

0xC2C4949F
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0xE4ED5DA4
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xC3493020
think_ again with all my might.
0xEB786F62

0xC2C4949F
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0xF36B83CC
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x4095023D
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0x3CB88DD0
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0xD072581C
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x5851EB7E
their resource?"
0x76EB9DFC

0xC2C4949F
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0xA3DA80D0
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0xDADA1AA4
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0xA0B1B5D3
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xFF219E32
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x631A3D83
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0x10B13834

0xC2C4949F
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x4251DA85
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xCA486D89
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x7350F04C
_---shire Herald_."
0x1FD77DAE

0xC2C4949F
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x565DD1BC

0xC2C4949F
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0x9454BE83

0xC2C4949F
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0x41A0A777
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0x94911A42
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0xD2A6A25E
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0x76240071
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0x36A60153

0xC2C4949F
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0xAAEF5382
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x7F042A90

0xC2C4949F
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x536D3F04
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0x708D8063

0xC2C4949F
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0xFA3B39B1
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x6A21C109
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0x67B66E8E
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0x81ABE1D4
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0x18EC22C7
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0x623452D2
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x0D1BC8F0
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0x5D5490EE
shire."
0x72D224CE

0xC2C4949F
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0xA7AA5170
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x7E62CA99
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0xB7C0BDBD
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0xBDE41124
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0xF2260FD6
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0xA59D9B50
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0xF101CB06

0xC2C4949F
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x6438EEFC
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x6AC5C230
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x90B5483E
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0xB28E02DF
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xEB972594
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xD3E26EDC
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0xF6FB0B31

0xC2C4949F
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x94887C98
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x9115E384
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0xC25F2F57
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xCBB49E71
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0x6909024D

0xC2C4949F
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0x09BAF992

0xC2C4949F
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x98BCC03F
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x6029E25B
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0xE607A14D
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0xD9266598
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0x368C7666

0xC2C4949F
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0x88A17218

0xC2C4949F
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x60A09EFB
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0xD86168E9
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0x8499AAA3

0xC2C4949F
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x03EC3722
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x038A8F74
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0xC135F2E6
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x385688EB
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x6BC894DE
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x3EC1A180
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x9D654CEC
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x1FA448A2
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x8CA31A2F
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x5F1B05A9

0xC2C4949F
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0xDEBE56B1
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0xC18140F1
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x225E897C
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0x2C153713
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0xFEC98BC4
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0xE2A87FFA
direction:--
0xDAAF818A

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x2D087A76

0xC2C4949F
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0xCE92775C
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x0D81DEFB
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x0DF39C27
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0x8E33D7D4
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x3B475558
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x5B5977D6
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xD06D9680
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0xDC8EA04C
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x764F46DA
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x5FF700C5
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0xB2698C8F
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x3DB29696
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x25A881B7
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x56AE3350
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0xB51DE51F
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0x04D8A8C2
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xD953326A
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x2DB70F25
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xF6B626E9
probably, be a good way from the town."
0xAAF33592

0xC2C4949F
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x2A35ABEC

0xC2C4949F
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0xAF5B6E5B
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x29F7F793
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x5FB369DD
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0x49CAE1B4
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0xE80C4499
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x7FE3870C
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x7F24FC09
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x2982D34B
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x7D1AA9DB
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x67F7C06B
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x5EC8709A
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x0A28ADAE
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0xA64AF972
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x82DC0D67
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0xE14276FB
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0xCE440E1E
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x664507A4
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xBF279766
forthwith be furnished me.
0xF73FD8DF

0xC2C4949F
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0xA05AA138
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x4BA6779E
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x987D3216
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0xA5612BE7

0xC2C4949F
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0x6674E6AF
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x3ECBE37B
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x3CB6C52A
years ago from Gateshead.
0xAB2B07D0

0xC2C4949F
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x8850F42C
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0x972DAE62
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0xF8EE293F
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x679F92DA
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x9488DAE9
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x179625FD
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0xFC020D10
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0x31D353A2
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x42F916BB
while the change was being accomplished.
0x73F537CD

0xC2C4949F
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x72E6DF20
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0x230D6A56

0xC2C4949F
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0x1351E2AD
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0xD817A997
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0xD25212E8

0xC2C4949F
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x332C7C7A
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0x2B6E12B2

0xC2C4949F
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x78F71C9E
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x6E2AC157
complexion.
0x6F201FAA

0xC2C4949F
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0xE9BD62E5
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x76F9B1E7

0xC2C4949F
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x0F1516A0
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x21C17129
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0xEBF31F72
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x814A140F

0xC2C4949F
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0xD3928382

0xC2C4949F
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x1ACB2843

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x13530D65
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x0BF2005D

0xC2C4949F
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x9EEEF94F

0xC2C4949F
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0xE3CE5F67

0xC2C4949F
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x0527203A
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x87E832B1
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x3AF7BDC1

0xC2C4949F
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0xD5FDC807
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0x57727C9D
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xBED7FD6B
would make two of you in breadth."
0x956DAF18

0xC2C4949F
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0x67D8588E

0xC2C4949F
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x6F533E91
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0x5B048DE3
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xC7A0341E
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x333F3EDD
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x15F8326D
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0x6F5E6770
quarrelling--"
0x9BFE61F9

0xC2C4949F
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0xE1AFC274

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xFD9FF616
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x9A295552
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0xD48C5FBA
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0x9C045A7B

0xC2C4949F
"What does he look like?"
0xDD379451

0xC2C4949F
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0xC1BCF90C
has such thick lips."
0x10FE9BEE

0xC2C4949F
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0xB9D96E77

0xC2C4949F
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x0FD28C40
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0xD37CC236
a deal of money."
0xE0FB50B7

0xC2C4949F
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x096E9CF4

0xC2C4949F
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x705A4BFC
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0x6C5346C8
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x35EF9F2F
you were quite out of my reach."
0x357349B6

0xC2C4949F
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x955CF0FE
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0x18C0B807
shape denote admiration.
0x1A7EF6B2

0xC2C4949F
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0xAB0E5399
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x41E24570
a child."
0xCCD22CCD

0xC2C4949F
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x1E63F752
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0xC2DBF867
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0xB80D06E6
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0xACD0D050

0xC2C4949F
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x58342951
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x557A42C2

0xC2C4949F
"A little."
0x480A8DE9

0xC2C4949F
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0x4D073699
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x84562F37
charmed.
0xE109765F

0xC2C4949F
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0xAC999CB5
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0x66AACE50

0xC2C4949F
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xA37D0997
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0xF621836E
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x173923B1
and which she had framed and glazed.
0xE29CABB9

0xC2C4949F
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x0AD270AB
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x61DB2F4E
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x0C647379

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x42C50B93

0xC2C4949F
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0xA1DB5DB1

0xC2C4949F
"I can."
0x5CCFE35E

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xA2B0EED5
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x55C1A390
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0xE505065A
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0xC399049E

0xC2C4949F
"Never in my life."
0x40858866

0xC2C4949F
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x0C135009
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0xEA71F37E
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x8B616DD8
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xA302D944
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0xB96710A8
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0xAEB4F2CB
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0x913DC820
father's brother."
0xEBE98816

0xC2C4949F
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x4412C028

0xC2C4949F
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x159A2297
tell me--"
0x60451549

0xC2C4949F
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0x5A804768

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xD2265F1C

0xC2C4949F
"So he went?"
0x3F6132D9

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x98787F02
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0xBF1ADB5C
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0xD63725A9

0xC2C4949F
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x034CA4A6
wine-merchant."
0x93FC7235

0xC2C4949F
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x56396FA3
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0x6F388726
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x60FAD27C
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0x9180F006
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x5F601BB0
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x0116C395
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x4437FA44

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XI
0xECDCFFDD

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0xFD9E5524
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x9980BFC9
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0xB06D0918
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x490D3EB2
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0xB6B5A752
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0xF6037377
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x3F295754
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0x728EAE74
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0x10722178
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x6D6E6CD8
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xE062A0CA
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0xE550DE52

0xC2C4949F
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0x55A45674
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x3BBD8C81
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x3A323C24
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0xB2544BD6
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0xE8940C97
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x1FC7A3AC
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0x3FD4C6E3
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0xB1104665
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0xA1306803
troubling my thoughts.
0x927EDEEA

0xC2C4949F
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x780674A9
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0xD9EBE8D1
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x64834C86
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x04A6515A
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0xDA1CE083
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x52908B07
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0xD25F1B03
the bell.
0xC0D86DB1

0xC2C4949F
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x68FB5DDB
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x7E044FC5

0xC2C4949F
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x9BF72B2B
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0xA908BCB8

0xC2C4949F
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x879A0CFE

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Person here waiting for you."
0xB6D07112

0xC2C4949F
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x7C9A4D0E
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0x2BC6AFC3
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0xE62C7E2F

0xC2C4949F
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x62CF8CD5
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x5DD934B9

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x3BAF8DD7
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0x5F0BB2F9
Thornfield.
0xB68CF52D

0xC2C4949F
"A matter of six miles."
0xB0987D48

0xC2C4949F
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0xC518CC56

0xC2C4949F
"Happen an hour and a half."
0xCD058B60

0xC2C4949F
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x2A053763
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x1A1461B5
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0xC0E752AB
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x0360DD52
much at my ease.
0x647CD21F

0xC2C4949F
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0xE8A6E326
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0x73457A3A
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x44379BA9
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x4BB48A5C
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0x41CECE77
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0xA6567557
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x05F5B699
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x2AC67C0F
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0xEBF37DE4
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0xF6A6F4E0
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0xB35585E2
road now, I wonder?"
0x5266DB9E

0xC2C4949F
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0xD63BC55A
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x3254B2B6
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0x7ED41F87
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0xD76401E5
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x99DF9DC5
more stirring, less romantic.
0xE2CB20A2

0xC2C4949F
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x2FBD175D
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x8BB7F2C2
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0xA1906DCA

0xC2C4949F
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0xFD1BB7D5

0xC2C4949F
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x560ADFC7
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0xC5C4CB55
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0xFAE7A695
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x8FE685A4
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x9F17C15F
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x532078F2
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x5417B92D
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x5E25D490

0xC2C4949F
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x0821B0D7
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x94CE0185
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0xFEA0A24F
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x65663B79
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x1334CF71
itself to my view.
0xFEF77C88

0xC2C4949F
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0xB97A1AF3
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x88F3560C
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0x5D97EB2C
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x58137138
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x939F7DD4
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0xC085E835
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x51158F20
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xBDF2F21A
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x4FDC0D22
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0xE37DF4BD

0xC2C4949F
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xB07CC28A
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0xE9056510

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0xD9B23FDA

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0x22EE9B61

0xC2C4949F
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0x44851E0F
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0xC0B4E0B7
trouble.
0xA1E0E241

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x11DFECB2
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x802579DF
the keys of the storeroom."
0xF7E51EBA

0xC2C4949F
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x65DACB0B
delivered them to the servant.
0xA8A2E50C

0xC2C4949F
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x60A330C3
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0xC58B916C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, ma'am."
0x7DB6BCB9

0xC2C4949F
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0xA6D3C3D8

0xC2C4949F
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xACD3CFDE
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x9BD46825
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x8FE600AB
too soon."
0x59721134

0xC2C4949F
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x0D4DFC45
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x81A27BAB
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0xDA2F3F48
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0x1059ADAE
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x3D3AD2D3
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0xD66DB502
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0x1459E512

0xC2C4949F
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x9E2C6F29
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0xB575C63C

0xC2C4949F
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xEF3E2E33
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x615179DC

0xC2C4949F
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x87034631

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0x88742BCA
future pupil."
0x0752D5DF

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xBCB36EAE

0xC2C4949F
"No,--I have no family."
0xC13AF584

0xC2C4949F
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x877E2308
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x36D923F7
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0xD7EEC4A0

0xC2C4949F
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x0712E5AD
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xE3BD1F5B
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0x15A4E489
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x5F3DB0A3
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x3ACAEB71
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0xA7B63D54
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x5D12DE53
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0x39B7609E
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0xF5E70D3F
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x4D586337
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x5662C05B
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x10DE4B29
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xE3428B47
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x46CD797F
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0x6361352D
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0xEE531CAF
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0xC00AE3DC
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x8999E0D9
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0x6BE7F8E5

0xC2C4949F
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0xC2D56FA2
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x1BBD6E84
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xEE4B3EAF

0xC2C4949F
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x88DAB6C6
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0x3A25C16E
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0x29727941
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0x0D806E27
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x617EF038
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0x5506BD00
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xA5F6A0FB

0xC2C4949F
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0x5D1F0D86
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x100ABA97
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x09B9D900
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xA3A61324
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x3403466E
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xFB5DE9E9
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0xE7B03E10
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x141227EE
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0xC08F8754
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0x113AEB57
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x95200DFF

0xC2C4949F
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0xCFB2FC3A
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x4FA31446
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0x7436FC68
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0xBB098D55
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0x5F460435
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0x6A4F279F
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x1040D8DB
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0xA09DF97C
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x3C455F14
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0x24A06963
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x30B9972A
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x511D0AAE

0xC2C4949F
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0xB01C52F6
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0xB3F278EF
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0xD161D646
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0xF004627A
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0x68FAD03A
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0x93EDFC29
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0x61C44E31
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xE3836C78
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0xAB777D15
an indefinite future period.
0xCA7A41CD

0xC2C4949F
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0x08FBCD19
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0xD74D5935
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0x1F23DE99
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0xC20BE46F
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x59ABCEA4
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x829DAEED
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xCF1D725E
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0xA9B8BB2B
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x11A31D82
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0x67AEEC36
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x96DD47B9
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x31555EFB
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x17270BE7
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x5AD21AA5
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0x9CDE0F68
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x89D728CE
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0x7688BA77
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x96A573E0
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0xB257600C

0xC2C4949F
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xF049313C
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0x7101378B
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0xC2A422BF
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x3E57ECB5
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0x26BB2C0C
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0x032EBE69
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x816317C2
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x46ED0531
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x35EDC26B
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x38C8D046
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x658C7AF6
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x049C0F2C
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x62F14299
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0xF6B32DB8
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0xCFC6E5C7
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x36B083B9
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x6AB64778
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0xB1D81EC3
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xA625D9AB
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x4992E202
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xD15A6253
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x991E35CB
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0xD0101FB5
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0xE89B0C9C
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0x2C55BDB0
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0xA10C651F
house and gates.
0xCF4C0F5F

0xC2C4949F
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x7E5E8499
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x714F6F27
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x884005E2
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0x92219C28
appeared at the door.
0x7B2E574C

0xC2C4949F
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x3AAF6E54
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x59E8AF28

0xC2C4949F
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x698E135A
much.
0xDE6F1B3F

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0xD3965BA7
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xD614228E
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x3B6AB3B5
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x7ABB8805

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0xA3257097

0xC2C4949F
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x9839FEEA
was called Rochester?"
0xD2513266

0xC2C4949F
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xD5ED1B32
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x58A1010D
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x03E67613

0xC2C4949F
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0xAB09BC09

0xC2C4949F
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x4F46A095
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x7CBE3679
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x5A0115BF
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x48FF9008
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0xB8753624
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x1F6B1FA1
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0xAF3A1574
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0xD281FCD8
expect nothing more."
0x1F0F6B48

0xC2C4949F
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0xA1C25D19

0xC2C4949F
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0xB365D20B
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x7935D736
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x7D9CF3F5
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x392603BE
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0x53A17D79
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0x02512AE6
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x04A56BE2
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x97A028A3

0xC2C4949F
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0xCE3F165A
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x4D329758
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0xE3C65CB3
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0xC3CB7A62
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0xD7908C61

0xC2C4949F
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x5CF75E47
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x3ABA406C
approached.
0xEAF8A792

0xC2C4949F
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x553EC9D6
nurse; who answered--
0x0CB353C8

0xC2C4949F
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x4A584458

0xC2C4949F
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0x2392452C

0xC2C4949F
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x483E9372
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xD6687366
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0xC0348874
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0xFF2D3868
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0x935EC8CA

0xC2C4949F
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x3A93816E
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x5ADE028F
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x5A3320EC
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x6369EC05
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0xF79B3D27
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x5015F367
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x885BBA91
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0xA9354A3C
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0xE7F50D7B
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0xD88BA77D
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0xEC8CD1B8
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x7491210C

0xC2C4949F
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x3586BF04
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x725052CB
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x62245B81
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x53E437D4
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x5C815716
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x93824D93
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0xD0944A3A
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x5CB0504F
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x05023D5F

0xC2C4949F
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x33557949

0xC2C4949F
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x7282D6CD
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x0CC7D622
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xD771F34D
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0x38943742
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0x6BCDB1B1
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0x062D82D3
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0xBA75308D
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0xC0E18A36
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x52ED8070
fed with crumbs."
0x0F8ACBEB

0xC2C4949F
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0xE889E1D9

0xC2C4949F
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x1B52A46D
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x3D04849B

0xC2C4949F
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0xE62249CB
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0xB371E95D

0xC2C4949F
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0xCC604614
clean town you spoke of?"
0xA35D75EC

0xC2C4949F
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xF1BD5E16
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0xF0B77233
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0xC895EB49
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0x48ECA5CB
hear me sing now?"
0x17DD82D8

0xC2C4949F
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x6DFF2EBA
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x34AC50DD
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0xB34CF2B7
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x7095165B
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x60008D3E
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x28FF53FC
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0xFFAECC6B
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0x014DDD68
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x56958A55
affected her.
0xDEE43422

0xC2C4949F
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x7BA67484
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x1940950F
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x12599A56
at least I thought so.
0x5750B69C

0xC2C4949F
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x604BD7F3
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0xF08F419A
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x754C4864

0xC2C4949F
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0xD771EFCF
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0xF8B22C63
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0xA117B89F
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x8A8D31BD
carefully trained.
0x7668E778

0xC2C4949F
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0xFDDADDD6

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0xA66A51A2
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x36063776
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0x1C6C45EF

0xC2C4949F
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x5310CC3B
say, with whom did you live then?"
0xBC63EBF6

0xC2C4949F
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0x1A6BBBFF
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0xC68EECCF
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0xC8DB52CB
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0xD86A9B22
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x557C4611
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0xD7A00CAE
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0xD7232E3A
and I never see him."
0x9BB1207D

0xC2C4949F
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xDDE3B623
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x86C85A85
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x5A0126C4
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x55020305
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0x00B82E77
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x1467DCA3
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0xBB43D550
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0xB293BFB1
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x1A9D3DC4
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x5205CBBC
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x2BD8DA6D
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x4A5B2920

0xC2C4949F
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x77CB6DFD
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x0EDA3139
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x3A570413
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x87397626
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0xF8091BE9
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x0C5C3D18
use.
0x5C886467

0xC2C4949F
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x0D645CAA
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xD6FC257E
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0x4E3D20EB
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x2F072A22
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0x92C4AA04
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0xBD9EBC58
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x51A9DF19
sideboard.
0xF6150803

0xC2C4949F
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x2F017C95
before seen any half so imposing.
0x6E2B8109

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x51258768
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0x23E01F12
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0x3C9A8A37

0xC2C4949F
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0xC7732E0A
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x7FE66D3E
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0xA8587E01
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x1AA6A9B4
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0xB2285318
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x42AFC27E
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0xA2C8FDD8
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0x5846F338
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x08024409
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0xDD409D1D
general blending of snow and fire.
0x703F59FB

0xC2C4949F
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x80BCC545
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x11095311
were inhabited daily."
0xA0D3DE2B

0xC2C4949F
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x4E5A858E
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0xE24F27EB
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0xEEC7023D
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0xDC82FB30

0xC2C4949F
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x7EA8F47B

0xC2C4949F
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0x0C8A8383
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0xD9B41F15

0xC2C4949F
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x3E4C7A37

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x81E8BD29
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x3E5841A4
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x41AD8202

0xC2C4949F
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xAAB64283
liked for himself?"
0x94A6894F

0xC2C4949F
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x904A34B1
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x9538268A
lived much amongst them."
0xECC6423E

0xC2C4949F
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0xEF32D334

0xC2C4949F
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0xDCB0309B
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x8CB28FA3
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x755FE271
conversation with him."
0xC8E0687E

0xC2C4949F
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x7EE85861

0xC2C4949F
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0x1CDD2D4A
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0xA835B0C0
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x8AD73E37
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x9ED76693
he is a very good master."
0xB99A313C

0xC2C4949F
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0x03AEAAF9
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x7DF121C0
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x3833828E
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0xEEC4883A
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x3F2DF795
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x9BEA5AFA
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0xE348C0FD
definite notion of his identity.
0xDA2CDBDD

0xC2C4949F
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0xAE2EA3FB
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0xEBE8C122
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0xFCF2FA10
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x80630E25
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x6AF43D96
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0xCCF72070
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0xFEAC06FD
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0xBE33C855
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x7B5628D1
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0x2275F13D
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0xDC2551C4
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0x93B60297
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x8EB34BD9
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0x71FA70D4
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0x918E8ED1
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x48E76074
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x62366290
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x59A20EB2
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0xC646113B
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0xC1609551
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0x4B49121C

0xC2C4949F
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0xDD0D96D6

0xC2C4949F
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0xBB2798C4
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0xE76EFAFF
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x900778C6

0xC2C4949F
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x3DA3B504

0xC2C4949F
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x60975B66

0xC2C4949F
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x8005EE2E

0xC2C4949F
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0x73DD985B
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xA4CC5E41
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xA0A57BFB

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x9EBB60B3
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0xA03D70FB

0xC2C4949F
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x6DC3D2D8
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0xF27C927A
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x71349393
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x9313054E
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x29B02FBF
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x43D60DE1
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x9A437D6D
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x9C706A02
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0x0F72BBFA
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x326F0BF5
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x433CA230
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x8C58B719
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x78610CB8
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x84193036
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x04B00618
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x68CBB2DA
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0xFC20E037

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x2B30C175
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0xAC109885
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0x47297549
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0xFE2CF3B7
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x71B8DBA2
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0xF024BA8D
Bluebeard's castle.
0xCB3967DA

0xC2C4949F
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x1A1FEA73
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x8525F1AF
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0xB5BAC3BA
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x50F8EC62
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x3C446374
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x1B782A48
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x71D4E029

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0xC3406D2A
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x2D11594E

0xC2C4949F
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0xAFF9EA17

0xC2C4949F
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xA4B9516B

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0xAAA080BB
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0xA297D22C

0xC2C4949F
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0xE15B6071
odd murmur.
0x0531FF9B

0xC2C4949F
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x20EA38CD

0xC2C4949F
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0x0C4A9DFF
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x8FB43A16
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0xD534D295
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0x81E5CBA9
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0x7BB3B2DC
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x0A85C935

0xC2C4949F
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0x819D3B7E
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x15B73BA2
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0xFE210F4C
be conceived.
0x738EE318

0xC2C4949F
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xAD2E73BB
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xE30FBAA1

0xC2C4949F
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x457C8020
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0xFCB985DA
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0x5C9FD2E3
pupil this morning?"
0x79C3A360

0xC2C4949F
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0x892E91E0
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0xEA7643D0
hall, exclaiming--
0x59CCE50A

0xC2C4949F
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0xA52D3848

0xC2C4949F
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
0x1A7FE55D

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XII
0x2792D069

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0xA8E305B6
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x64BD0511
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x5FADB009
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x9B632593
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0xA0752200
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0x902F6E2B
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x7B796801
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x30B549F8
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0x3CF7FBB0
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x65D19DE2
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xCEB9383A
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x1DA7C34B
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x015478FC
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x905232B7
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x4411AF39
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x3035D6F8

0xC2C4949F
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x466A5ACF
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0xF6EBC247
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0xEA37DA32
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x14CD61D7
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xB2DE9B9B
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0xEBB71CD3
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x56FD0A72
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x22C858FB
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x04272E48
of her mind and character.
0xEB82054A

0xC2C4949F
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0xC42C9CCF
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x2E4BC818
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0xFC4D6CE7
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x9D4F7F74
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xF903F829
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x6F6BE1A7
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0xF3699FC5
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0x14F22050
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x35F37093
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0x5330F0C9
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x3FC55913
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0xEB350A87
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x82A67570
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0xF3444D19

0xC2C4949F
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x204B8960
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x87D6B1A9
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x8802A79C
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0xB73F6D47
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x2A3A9C92
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0xDB4AD341
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x2F37A834
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0xA088B362
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0xAFBC572D
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0x0FB4B8E2
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0xB6D82BA9

0xC2C4949F
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x97958725
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x27D6D71D
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0xA34067FA
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x101473BE
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x3CD620F2
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x67D1226B
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0xF129B39F
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x039816D5
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xFE866061
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x4DDCD9EF
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x1C15CC19
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0xFE3CE300
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0xC097700F
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x9ACAD8A7

0xC2C4949F
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0xD914227E
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x5D5DB654
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x947DD002
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0x56D3A3A9
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0x272AFA0E
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x446BBCE0
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0xD0774DA6
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0x79E65B0D
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0x8D3D960D
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0xD974EAFE
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x94E59D2B
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xEE41EC72
every effort of that sort.

0xC2C4949F
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0xDC6F54E2
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x1CF25569
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x8E84BB92
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0xDA3374D1
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0x39980BC6
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.

0xC2C4949F
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x1DB9A17A
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x5A4F5A82
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x96162360
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x882BCC91
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x2EAA968B
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0xA0DBFBCA
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x9DFC772B
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0xC0EC70FD
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0x5BCDCCE2
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x094DBE96
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0x7086F3C1
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x0C0B19BD
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0xF68B81F0
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x5D546EE0
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0xAD5EFE53

0xC2C4949F
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x207286BF
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xFFD52D9B
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x79613196
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x6DE84EF5
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x4303167B
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0x5050852A
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0xAB12BF26
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0x2C3D2D85
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xDCB9D85E
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x4BAF8B64
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0xEB23FA70
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x6453D8AB
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0xF4373815
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0xED2A99E6
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x0A0D80D4

0xC2C4949F
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x249D2F8F
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0x9A135029
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x52B05A41
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0xB605AD38
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x3AE48BB9
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x07B49CEA
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0xACFE5768
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0x5DF7B1D1
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0x3D272919
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x6C9D57C0

0xC2C4949F
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0xE720BA86
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x997BFE88
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x3C5CDE93
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x86378A83
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x5F4BA5B5
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xBCB810F4
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x1F4B9DEC
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0xD8463362

0xC2C4949F
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x93B12D11
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0xA091F9D7
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x1EA87F55
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x30771B2C
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0x4533CB6B
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x667219C0

0xC2C4949F
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x57961E2F
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x5755ADC2
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0x2CCF5E5C
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0xB607BF0D
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xDE6BF4D6
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0xA3B92ABB
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0x5A11E85D
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x8BF1BFDB
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0x99718D83
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0xD0706AD8
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0x95B72DB0
me.
0x8830A70E

0xC2C4949F
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x7CAD7409
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x88F40AC7
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x30DAE5C1
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x05B8DF58
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x92B7EE5D
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x76207A66
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x8105E508
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xF5DD8A04
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0xF0866C4C
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0x0EEC3B9B
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x9537119B
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x16E450D5
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x89C57682
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0x95EE2393
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0xB8BBE05B
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x42D90F78
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0xA2056F7D
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x46E84B28
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0xE00564DD
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x920148DA
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0xC9B4D8D4
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0xD94734A7
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x6A4A399D

0xC2C4949F
"Are you injured, sir?"
0xEDE8B98D

0xC2C4949F
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x4B0EDB79
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xD6998C99

0xC2C4949F
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x44E3A141

0xC2C4949F
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0xCF6FBBE4
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0x65867F97
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xFB3D132F
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x68F3D396
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x1176A898
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0xAC520D0A
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x9BF60E04
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x225286A5
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x76B8ADED

0xC2C4949F
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0xA560731D
now drew near him again.
0x364674BB

0xC2C4949F
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0x1C989C58
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0x16BA5C89

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0xB5B2D555
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0xBC38BCE4
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xC483A569

0xC2C4949F
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0xCE720949
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xD992684D
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x9A0042C9
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0xE05FDF72
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x42EBEF04
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0xD06B7EF4
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x4A3570F5
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0xD87BF9C4
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0x0D3670EC
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x49EBA28C
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x1E439B9C
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0x3DA0F3DC
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x24EDFAE8
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x14DAE735
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x134D7AA8
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0x7FD43FD9

0xC2C4949F
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x3F96ABED
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0xD607407B
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x4CF5627C
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0xEEED1D47
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x540D5B2E

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0x86DB7B0A
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0xAD7CFBD0

0xC2C4949F
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0xB1420156
direction before.
0xA2D7108D

0xC2C4949F
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x39A78C44
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x1BA40039

0xC2C4949F
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x58C823B5
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0xF36B03E7
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0x7806708C

0xC2C4949F
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x8AC9772B
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x52D8B86D
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0xB5B3B276
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0x5ADAECED

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Whose house is it?"
0xA1E4BCB1

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x28FAEA03

0xC2C4949F
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0xE40A246F

0xC2C4949F
"No, I have never seen him."
0xBD5B02CF

0xC2C4949F
"He is not resident, then?"
0xE8BB0CD8

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x27C38B03

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot."
0xC5001BBE

0xC2C4949F
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x1DCA4A75
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x03EB2AF6
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x901D41BF
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x43E15566

0xC2C4949F
"I am the governess."
0xA398A568

0xC2C4949F
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0xF86CC810
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x542E3FF6
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x6202BEFC

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x811E24A4
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0xBFB114C8

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0xF839F221

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0x65CF0068
afraid?"
0x2A04E0CF

0xC2C4949F
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x13762A07
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0xD347EB3A
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xB82CF338
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0xC8886318
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0xBD7129B3
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xF1B7B0BC
he laughed.
0x328F1E96

0xC2C4949F
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0x20268F56

0xC2C4949F
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xC50CC57F
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x5680E3B1
come here."
0x32D3B9CF

0xC2C4949F
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x068FE1B6
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xDDC42AF1
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x3AE2D6B1
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0x50D119C7
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0xC8F524BF

0xC2C4949F
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x56D48DFE
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x017D19B1

0xC2C4949F
I sought it and found it.
0x781C132C

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0xEC27CF12
you can."
0x439F2C3A

0xC2C4949F
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x4B510526
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0x78C3A638

0xC2C4949F
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x01F3B639
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xDF54E38C

0xC2C4949F
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x12C27D00
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x4F5C9D42
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x7B72FE65
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0x89DEED40
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xB0E04ED6
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x3B2CB2F7
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0x6B26FFF9
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x338F6591
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0xDAA53DB0
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x488C4EAC
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x60CC1DE7
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x516D48C8
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0xA546D9B2
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x71C7CCAC
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x8DAE6633
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x2F1561F6
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x02614BC5
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x2AD6B43F
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0x39D46071
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xE4E4E0E6

0xC2C4949F
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x650AAE9D
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xB730A6F7
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xDEF19839
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0xE1BD26C5
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0xC1DB849A
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x994B27B6
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xE31893CF
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x51484086
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x8FCAF8F4
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x1D89D6F8
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x32B76336
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0xE611627B
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0xCEC59AE8
as it would be under his.
0x98A543C3

0xC2C4949F
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0x7B09F8B8
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x56DC1D09
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0x4C14086C
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x264FABDB
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0xB5EF8163
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0xDE97145E
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x427BD8E7
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0x5B470563
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0x942B476E
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0x6756D237
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0xB8B7A2D3
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0xD75CFCCA
door, and went in.
0xC9703514

0xC2C4949F
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x4B5AB3CA
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0x431D3161
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x31481E63
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x265678D5
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x4120616C
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x1C620FD5
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x26352255
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x62714CBB
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x9A3A1CAE

0xC2C4949F
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0xEB23048C
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0xBF04EEA2
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x62C24351
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0x2B376D3D
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0xE63A5926
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x377CDB34
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x02D1EAD4
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x2BF03A75
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x216F8028

0xC2C4949F
"What dog is this?"
0x48C62E71

0xC2C4949F
"He came with master."
0xAFF97B8A

0xC2C4949F
"With whom?"
0x80183016

0xC2C4949F
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x2385303C

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xA6886BB5

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x46775A85
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x5AED1C40
sprained."
0x726AAF1E

0xC2C4949F
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x6133C71D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0xF164B01C

0xC2C4949F
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0x9EB66C3E

0xC2C4949F
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0x2B1E7972
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x46FC6E37
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x158FF16B
upstairs to take off my things.
0x326D42DE

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XIII
0x791B1360

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x1BCF8AC7
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x8E08DD88
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0x2B3154A4
and waiting to speak with him.
0xB5D318AD

0xC2C4949F
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0xC321BAD4
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0xAE933510
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xCD8DAECB
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0xF3A3B939
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0x825567EC
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0xE2DCF2E8
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0x5714728D
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0xE2856AE3
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0xB8761335

0xC2C4949F
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x948D3B71
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x49006B4B
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0xD19F0B20
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x1DCF7A92
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0xB02911F1
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x3A08AB15
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0xE6B35F88
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x53834E81
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x5CF331E7
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x4633FBC2
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x2C1EE0D2

0xC2C4949F
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x0143528B
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x685C04D8
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x9095971F
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x6AC8096B
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x4279A5F5

0xC2C4949F
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xB4E7393C
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x3320BABC
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x69688EB2
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x6FA22229
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x67434C64
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x57445918
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0xBCE785DB
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xA3E56395
fireside.
0xEB53E566

0xC2C4949F
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x412A0271
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x3DFB7E3C
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x03E8DC0C
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0xC9753FC1
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x94793760

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0x494EE37D
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0xEB48BBF4
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0xF38886D0

0xC2C4949F
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xC6F744B0

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x875003E3
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0xDEC771CF
candle."
0x3B2E636F

0xC2C4949F
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x26A052F1

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0xA9AEEA41
is here."
0xA7382122

0xC2C4949F
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xFA62114D
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0x4C7A279A
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x17BFD58C
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0x202B19AA
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0x8DC8AB7C

0xC2C4949F
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0xEA632223
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0x6F1AB83C
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0xB8F66C61
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xC626C012
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0x5181C822
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x3BF019B0
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x92F616CF

0xC2C4949F
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x5B85E875
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0xD8210BAA
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0xFA92F75D
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0xF6520AAC
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x1D1DF8E2
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0x6852B750
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x5BADD609
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x757352ED
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x09F95DFC
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0x87B45E19
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x7B705003
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0xF63C5ED5
neither tall nor graceful.
0xCAB3BD60

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x08FD14DE
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0x986B4D18
lifted his head as we approached.
0x3C2BD09C

0xC2C4949F
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0xFC57CF32
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0xC796721E

0xC2C4949F
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0xA778764A
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0xC9E04923
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x77FCA636
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0xE23D8708

0xC2C4949F
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x6088A51B
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0xB2FD115F
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x64838400
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x6490A99E
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0xAB4DCBCF
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x649078EC

0xC2C4949F
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0x37E16B21
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0xB82F654A
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0xE4089BA2
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x5DDBB3F2
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x3E416ED2
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x75A6AE8C

0xC2C4949F
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0xED480EB6
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x261220A3
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x7E20AF9B
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xCDA765F4

0xC2C4949F
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x01210899
might perhaps spill it."
0x7ADF2D47

0xC2C4949F
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0xC6702785
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x6424FDFE

0xC2C4949F
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0xD3D1C743
votre petit coffre?"
0x8D7F7E5B

0xC2C4949F
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x12EE2B60
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x1049A715
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x9F1276FC

0xC2C4949F
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x1ABF3485
thought pleasant things."
0x81D6973D

0xC2C4949F
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x78F7AC63

0xC2C4949F
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x5F1AD08A
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x4820172A
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xEDBF0904
nature."
0xA8223FDF

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0xF286B1ED
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x52B99550

0xC2C4949F
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0xE5490CA8
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0xBEE694E4
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0xB937D508
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x8F451D2C
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x8C9E58E2

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x90A4E6ED
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xB20AA342
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0x3A460D98

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0xB1582F45
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0xD5DD009C

0xC2C4949F
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x948F9976

0xC2C4949F
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x0A183FD4
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0xB6AF6CC9
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x9BFE340A
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0x195C0D3D
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0xE3D877C3
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x7884778B

0xC2C4949F
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0x8EECC90E

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And you came from--?"
0x806680A0

0xC2C4949F
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xBC8E9E38

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0xD3BC53AA

0xC2C4949F
"Eight years."
0x009A4D30

0xC2C4949F
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0xA5284EB1
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0xDA9E41B2
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0x19F501C6
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x6F622347
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x1596F52D
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xD0E07262

0xC2C4949F
"I have none."
0xF2C21206

0xC2C4949F
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0xFF810DAA

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0xF4934F50
that stile?"
0x82548B86

0xC2C4949F
"For whom, sir?"
0xD9684F8C

0xC2C4949F
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0xE1927A40
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0xB593B408
causeway?"
0x46F7B97B

0xC2C4949F
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0x350E7C68
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0x0A2C6D32
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0xAB81DABE
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x29E097B6
revels more."
0x35B9270A

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xE0A0F3CD
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x050FC12D

0xC2C4949F
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x7077882F
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0xA11A3829

0xC2C4949F
"No; none that I ever saw."
0x14AA44D1

0xC2C4949F
"And your home?"
0x613ABC5F

0xC2C4949F
"I have none."
0xF2C21206

0xC2C4949F
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x9EFC2ABC

0xC2C4949F
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0x103175C7

0xC2C4949F
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0x8EC86021

0xC2C4949F
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xA12EB27A

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x5D039C91
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0xF22CB88C
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x881414A9
Adele."
0x00EC47F3

0xC2C4949F
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x603C9FB4
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0xC95E90D1
felling my horse."
0x8D7F3394

0xC2C4949F
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x3FB3B4C6

0xC2C4949F
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0xE1C19B50

0xC2C4949F
The widow looked bewildered.
0xAF7D8217

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x5406B042

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0xC2C4949F
"Have you seen much society?"
0x35DE4975

0xC2C4949F
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0x75D75920
Thornfield."
0xE1D670EC

0xC2C4949F
"Have you read much?"
0x9AB6D22A

0xC2C4949F
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0x0095842F
very learned."
0xB45A3333

0xC2C4949F
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x8E26272C
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0x0A47D1B0
parson, is he not?"
0xF5CE47C0

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0xE816370F
would worship their director."
0x9550CF13

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, no."
0xF77DF4C1

0xC2C4949F
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x0CBA69A6
sounds blasphemous."
0xFC3D15A5

0xC2C4949F
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0xAADB5E57
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0xB94C7B96
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0xB150987B
hardly sew."
0xF857F9D7

0xC2C4949F
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x6B6CE454
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0xC2A1C072

0xC2C4949F
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0xB8453E97
Rochester.
0xB2F8F0FC

0xC2C4949F
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0x885B2A05
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x03537185
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x2490A15D
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0xB9B383EB
to bed."
0x2C6E9A30

0xC2C4949F
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0xB7511A10

0xC2C4949F
"About ten."
0x8F4BC38D

0xC2C4949F
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0xAF519F3A

0xC2C4949F
I assented.
0x7B0BD9CE

0xC2C4949F
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0xA6C14870
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x4DD900F4
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xE6328717
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0xB4137E00

0xC2C4949F
"A little."
0x480A8DE9

0xC2C4949F
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0xC734E205
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0xD3679A2E
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xB1686182
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0xE877C966
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0x1D2CF4DC

0xC2C4949F
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x91B1536B

0xC2C4949F
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x0CE41960
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xE925851A
not well."
0xCDF60457

0xC2C4949F
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0xD3C2F992
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x2C93E60E
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0x234F2D02

0xC2C4949F
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x389ACA26

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x7553C073
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x45A4C17C
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x2FAAE6C8

0xC2C4949F
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0xEAE053CE

0xC2C4949F
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0xA71D4E74

0xC2C4949F
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x7E793AC0
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x6347D49C

0xC2C4949F
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0xADC81082
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x7F2CED7A

0xC2C4949F
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x91A43FCC
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x6130CA30

0xC2C4949F
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0x4A0529A4
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0xFDB8B3E9
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x88E9B8F3
hand yours?"
0x7CA7BFF9

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0xA9857E91
some thought."
0xBD9647EE

0xC2C4949F
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0x01334386
other occupation."
0xB91C9E23

0xC2C4949F
"Where did you get your copies?"
0x259FC99A

0xC2C4949F
"Out of my head."
0xD7E2AC68

0xC2C4949F
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x6914476C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0x4E6D622B

0xC2C4949F
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0xCAF9FD7C

0xC2C4949F
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0xB606798D

0xC2C4949F
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0xD52CE8C7
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0x27593C72
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xBA328703
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0xCF2FDDE8
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x12498691
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0xC004C3F5

0xC2C4949F
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x8F7002F4
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x4489292A
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xAC79CE8B
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0xEBA83D44
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x3BCA7D9D
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0x8BA6A4BF
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x633A34A2
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0xA3A7C600
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x5D9C75F2
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0xA104BF79

0xC2C4949F
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x7A8928F7
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x3B324560
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0x01B52A04
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x9CFCCB03
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x84D3B829
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x64961A34
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0xEAC801C6
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0xA91F94A7
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x6D2679DB
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0xC29BCFE9

0xC2C4949F
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x88C79847
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x625349C6
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x5B71AC5C
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xD534074F
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xF75F4ABC
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0xDA4966D9
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0xF15F4A23
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0xEFCCB646
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x1DC3D7CE
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x061910BE
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x2760FE20
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xEA918D78

0xC2C4949F
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x253B2896
presently.
0x654031D1

0xC2C4949F
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x87383ACC
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x9EEFEEF2

0xC2C4949F
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0xC852A70A
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0xA8CDF26B
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x9BAE6B4E
each day?"
0x6C0A28D4

0xC2C4949F
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x57566EBE
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x8AA52679
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0x444CD322

0xC2C4949F
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0xA002AFC0

0xC2C4949F
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0xAC91EAEB
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x738EB7BA
powerless to realise."
0xD7B4338F

0xC2C4949F
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x9325D637
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0xEF801F98
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0xB9120A84
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x68239EEB
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0xEE9D749F
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0xDBFC4B9A
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0xC1386E11
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0xFACE6BBA
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0xD63D5F3D

0xC2C4949F
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x2B5D3BD0
watch, he said abruptly--
0x39178AB4

0xC2C4949F
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x6A4AD1EB
so long?  Take her to bed."
0x0B137AE9

0xC2C4949F
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x9C69CAF4
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0xA6CA961E
much.
0xDE6F1B3F

0xC2C4949F
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x8B1F74F2
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x92664EC0
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0xDD8F5203
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x95AF6031

0xC2C4949F
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x688E4D48
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x0CEED68C

0xC2C4949F
"Well, is he?"
0x958D36BA

0xC2C4949F
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x3B789785

0xC2C4949F
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xA89DDE64
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xB47DF3C3
temper, allowance should be made."
0xC1551B8C

0xC2C4949F
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0xC2C4949F
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0xA05A708D
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0x9D15E74D
make his spirits unequal."
0xCDA4C5C2

0xC2C4949F
"What about?"
0x0C7A78F1

0xC2C4949F
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0x55BC8545

0xC2C4949F
"But he has no family."
0x72A907DE

0xC2C4949F
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x3E2480DB
brother a few years since."
0xEA0FD9D7

0xC2C4949F
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x5ADA102F

0xC2C4949F
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0xA97FA320
the property; only about nine years."
0x4956F926

0xC2C4949F
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0x8F898712
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0xB31B1D75

0xC2C4949F
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x3BB4B3A9
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x9E30C66C
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x4BC4D0C7
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0xC0024D56
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0xBCF1DE9E
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x3BD58F4F
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x5230FFD1
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x81110631
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0xEA49BE98
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x7D2B420D
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0x920AEA33
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x2CE3A19F
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0xCBCF4B27
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0xDE4BF088
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0xEA2B9A1F
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0x5998ADE9

0xC2C4949F
"Why should he shun it?"
0x3F28E982

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0xF2535696

0xC2C4949F
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0x2D830CFC
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xF728F3CD
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0xCAB3E51E
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x87798B1F
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x047C2C79
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x0E8156AF

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XIV
0x6408F53B

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xB6F946F4
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0xD74AE39A
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0x76490112
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x237A4A17
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0xEF6355F2
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x8A8AEB00

0xC2C4949F
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0xA7942DDD
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0xB7102893
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0xEBA53210
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0xDAEF029E
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x66D3D471
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0x9D5FF256
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x30E49F9E
causes quite disconnected with me.
0xF4C6CFA0

0xC2C4949F
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0xD49888D2
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x38D2A789
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xB2DE6152
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x4DF68CD2
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0xDD2AB4F1
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0x37040D92
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x777B254A
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0xCA5CFDBC
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x967C3EAD
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0xC41019A9
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x56D9D467
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0xB8CB7865
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x4499CE91

0xC2C4949F
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0xAEC19428

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0xA19E0515
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x2A4DB8A3
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x483811DB
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x08951130
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x09B071BC
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x8219BCF2
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x59DDAAFD

0xC2C4949F
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x159095FE
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x55B1B9BA
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xED010A5B
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0xD6A733E4

0xC2C4949F
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0x298BA89A
contemplation.
0x802D1825

0xC2C4949F
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0x77517A9A
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x3728D2C6

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x843C739C
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0xCC646F18
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xECC02A63
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x8F940627
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0xF3972E95
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x6E64BF0D
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x9447F318
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x28798B12
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0xE4CE8348
said to be thicker than water."
0xBDEB0551

0xC2C4949F
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x2FA09FE6
knitting-basket in hand.
0xBEF28E39

0xC2C4949F
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0xBC7E0C06
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0x4C6C774E
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xAB1088AA
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0x955C2647
performed."
0xE1467DC8

0xC2C4949F
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0xACA06B20
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x12D62751
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x65F6C8C4
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x9805ABD6

0xC2C4949F
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0xBEF93551
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0xCF4E1307
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x56EEA065
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x3C8D51CF
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0x6317F3A3
mind to do."
0x3CB55F76

0xC2C4949F
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0xE514579C
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xE9D61AD0
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x6474CFB0

0xC2C4949F
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0x7AACDD6A
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0x120A1935
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0xD2283425
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0xE46CD11A
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x70775A07
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xDB6B6325

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x718612B9
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0xCEDC31D0
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x8B317F57
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x561BC6A9
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x0190B986
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x914F1BB7
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0x7CE667F5
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0x87BC5B0F
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x365890E5
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0xFF98C717
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x0F13F50D
feeling.
0x5781CE73

0xC2C4949F
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x40F0BBEC
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0xFF722242
fastened on his physiognomy.
0x0893CD98

0xC2C4949F
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0xC182E3C0

0xC2C4949F
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x43F1BF45
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x8D020010
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0xC99C83F4

0xC2C4949F
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0xED623DFF
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x3A1EE0BA
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x7E95D5CB
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x052F433C
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x45EC5C2B
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x667EF8CD
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0xD595F3C7
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0xE6DAFF86
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xECAD53F7
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xEC41EBBE

0xC2C4949F
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x39D284A5
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0xEBA02F7B
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x16BC0BE0
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0xB970723A
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xC38C211F

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0x6E778791
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x04CBB784

0xC2C4949F
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0xC4014445
does my forehead not please you?"
0xF746BDE0

0xC2C4949F
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x03322349
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x8CEFA73D
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x4004A4C6

0xC2C4949F
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0xF910776B

0xC2C4949F
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0xBD6EB319
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0xB7BFBDDC

0xC2C4949F
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x435045B0
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0x109D50A7
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x8A726DB1
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x56ACBB5C
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xFD20B111
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x31641B37
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xC0F69B3B
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0xD5617477
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0xDDEB98B8
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x90A3CC53
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x923C7BC6
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0xC0BF7E66
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0xBCB22CC6
me?"
0xFE39FFA7

0xC2C4949F
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x9A951E88

0xC2C4949F
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0x7F77BAA4

0xC2C4949F
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x0661ADC2
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x2D6C53E5
capable of being re-transformed?
0x8619F98A

0xC2C4949F
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0xF047B874
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x9B4AABD7
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xA4BDA62F
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0x71373153
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x913EB64B
to-night."
0x212AA641

0xC2C4949F
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x21963D15
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x77F2BB18
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x602C3DD5
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x4D3B8152
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x552F0C2E
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0xBF2A5AB9
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x2736AA95
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x5FCE1E9D
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x53C9E154
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0xE5283DB4
confidence.
0x7935F271

0xC2C4949F
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x4B586121
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x36B6B660
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xA5EC8B79
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0xFAB32F05
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x9C50A29A
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0xB0AB8FA7
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x4E7F05D3
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0xC0AA7111
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xEC28C18F
you--therefore speak."
0xA1BA7BB2

0xC2C4949F
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x667B0B31
smile either.
0xE3D95AC5

0xC2C4949F
"Speak," he urged.
0xE8E5F6D8

0xC2C4949F
"What about, sir?"
0x771686DD

0xC2C4949F
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xACD4207B
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x492902B4

0xC2C4949F
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x20717CFE
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xEB5C8FF0
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0x3DCFAF37

0xC2C4949F
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0x3B2DEBF8

0xC2C4949F
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0x0769E7CA
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0xC091DBA4

0xC2C4949F
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xD43064F1
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0xFCEA8970
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0xDF6F5543
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xEFEBA3D5
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x85D96AD7
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xEBFF234A
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x4F5AF78C
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0xA6FE7A51
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x3C8D6813
rusty nail."
0x525D6FF8

0xC2C4949F
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x5C19BDF2
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x43EF4221

0xC2C4949F
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x40A1B774
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x635375F8
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0xCA8C54CB

0xC2C4949F
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x6033FE72
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0xD666B7B4
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x5F479196
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x06C90B01
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x25A8C5CB
people in one house?"
0x5BC54080

0xC2C4949F
"Do as you please, sir."
0xF4205EB6

0xC2C4949F
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x862181CA
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x2D9009F2

0xC2C4949F
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0xBBF50088
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0xCF720B17
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x67423460
and experience."
0x2D6434A2

0xC2C4949F
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0xAB549E03
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x656E1349
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x4B0DB126
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x9454151A
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xA4DF7740

0xC2C4949F
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xAB9F4365
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0x89FDB237

0xC2C4949F
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0xA699D838
expression; "but speak too."
0xEC819082

0xC2C4949F
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x0CE415E1
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xB8834701
their orders."
0xB6E6D457

0xC2C4949F
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0x53987C44
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0xE5DB2DEE
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x73DE4051

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0xFCFF39D2
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xB785D1BB
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x84ACA355

0xC2C4949F
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0xAD1E1733
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0xCC897B62

0xC2C4949F
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xEC66F268
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0xA95C7CD3
salary."
0x5401120A

0xC2C4949F
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x37919692
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x58B94B03
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x4D4EAB1B
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x4BD2E03C
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x161E95A9
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0xEF8AB06B
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0xAAF057BB
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xFF221B00
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x002885DA
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0xC7F4788C
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x8A6AFA0A
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0xEDC41F1D
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x6913C977
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0x6D9DF0AC

0xC2C4949F
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0xF305755D
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x1324C984
as well as imagined--
0x42929542

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x68C466C0
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x4EF9D36D
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0xF38AEF7E
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x6E704440
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xA4CDC552
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x1FA190A7
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x7BA57D82
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x2549CBA2
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x09144AD8
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x8D5675F2
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x20E206C4
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0xA193BDB4
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x9ACDA975

0xC2C4949F
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x91D298B6

0xC2C4949F
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0xB9FD83E0
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x461108C2
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x1923A0A0
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0xD3A22C16
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xBD06EBE4
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0xD12F3CB7
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x1AFE5540
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0x55B0978D
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x759B8F76
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0x02F65948
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x5797E48F
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0x5292AE34
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0xECC3F815
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0x8B27416E
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x5CC5BA8D
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x8D8A241B
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0xDF8D781F
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0xC2FA1247

0xC2C4949F
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0x4B516A79

0xC2C4949F
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0x4C90B41E
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x27A69237
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x9ABAB411
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0xD2D3C01E
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0xACB9F611
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x0A4CC65D
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0x5AB237D7
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0xC8FCC825
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x528C82FD

0xC2C4949F
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x39360853

0xC2C4949F
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0x4A0F8234
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0x6CEE5CA4
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0x8AF94A31
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0xA57413ED
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0x2DB6838D

0xC2C4949F
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0xB5CB83B0

0xC2C4949F
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0xABFB3AA0
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0xFF0F863A
moor."
0xF115A6F4

0xC2C4949F
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0x0DA66181

0xC2C4949F
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0xEE9D8B3C
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0x320ABE9F
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x9AE04AD0
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0xA65682CD
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0xF65AD9B6

0xC2C4949F
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x5B8B865D
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0x32A64101

0xC2C4949F
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x32B5047D
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0x126E2D03
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0xAFBD53DD
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0x919C29E9
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0x22BFECA0
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0xD4477C5B

0xC2C4949F
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0xB79C17F5

0xC2C4949F
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0x4F7A7045
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0x6B1F454B
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0xE1885793

0xC2C4949F
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0x3FE19525
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0xFFB92E80
misery if you listen to it."
0x9CAC3251

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0xB7517178
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0xAEEC9941
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0x99020AF7

0xC2C4949F
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0xEA018B33
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0x04EEDDE5
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0x33B548C3

0xC2C4949F
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0xA788EF11
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0x68449649
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x6D6261D6

0xC2C4949F
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0x6176BA1B
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x232E0587
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0x349902FF
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0x27EA9ECD
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0x221AC970
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0x9001B71F
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0x3EAE8F89
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0x4211C1AE
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0xBF2E95D6
which you might revert with pleasure."
0x4C904604

0xC2C4949F
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0x9872B8B8
paving hell with energy."
0x03757330

0xC2C4949F
"Sir?"
0x522CD5EA

0xC2C4949F
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0xFE31E35D
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0x85994971
been."
0xC42DFB7E

0xC2C4949F
"And better?"
0x089FFB09

0xC2C4949F
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0x1C52B7D5
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0x6165D6C8
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0xED8C8FA0
and Persians, that both are right."
0xC234A621

0xC2C4949F
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0xCB0B8749

0xC2C4949F
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0xCB1B288E
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0x57522CC1

0xC2C4949F
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0x35E5503B
is liable to abuse."
0x8E858E14

0xC2C4949F
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0xEC2A4252
abuse it."
0xAA9FC569

0xC2C4949F
"You are human and fallible."
0x5691AAC9

0xC2C4949F
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0xA5737CA8

"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0xB6CA2AAE
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xFE603495

0xC2C4949F
"What power?"
0x43897688

0xC2C4949F
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x5F016FC9
right.'"
0x43BA9ECA

0xC2C4949F
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0xEBE72740

0xC2C4949F
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0x689F5E44
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0xD52283B0
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0xD50EC8B8
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0x564DDDBE
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0x0D031CB4

0xC2C4949F
"Where are you going?"
0x9C21E4C3

0xC2C4949F
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xD8AD4DEA

0xC2C4949F
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0xFB11EA14

0xC2C4949F
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0xA4F5606D
certainly not afraid."
0x68FA9635

0xC2C4949F
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0xD5F3BFF3

0xC2C4949F
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0x00561231

0xC2C4949F
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0xC5342266
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0xAFCC2495
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x46A1E9F1
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0x801B04B0
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0x368A1D38
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0xC3FB1B15
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0xCE10AF7E
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x6010D4C2
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0x1E35C87E
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0xB4096E3A
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0x04834250
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x2778D5E4
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0x681CCCA1
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0x3098C8E3

0xC2C4949F
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x40DAACBB

0xC2C4949F
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0x8243F4B9
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0x2AC5DC87
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0xBFCB06E8
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0x99BC8B72
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0xAFA35011
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0x168D7568
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0x07DC8FCA
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0x5535BCC7
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x43A5FDB3
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x75A58B49
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0x7230F87B
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0xE54AD8B8
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0x26919C10
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x863B1598
will be realised."
0x86037653

0xC2C4949F
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0x65854139
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x44F2A634
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0x58812707
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0xA27F25ED
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0x61EF1F83
and small white satin sandals.
0xE2B14684

0xC2C4949F
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0xD969D4BD
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0x2DAD27F7

0xC2C4949F
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0xACB89F51
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0x5C5506C9
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0xC71A919B

0xC2C4949F
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x2C7A698D
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0x72C3E6DB

0xC2C4949F
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x8988D44A
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0xBD433BCA
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0xED5CACBD
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0xC211C574
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0x2D3F1208
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0xAA2DD02E
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x0FF95323
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0x11A15BBA
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0x69ABEC92
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x8CFF946D
Good-night."

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XV
0x3A52BBAA

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x90ECDF25
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0x7CC6B039
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0xCE582E33
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0x4901963D

0xC2C4949F
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0x59D68873
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0xC0A48862
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x3C41499D
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0xAB2F514A
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x29D882CC
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0xF649CB24

0xC2C4949F
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x1BF5A1AC
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0xF8F68462
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0x752314CF
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0xF4FA3381
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0x3C79AE11
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0xF41A5227
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0x786DA509
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xD6DDF9EF
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0x07AD4B35
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0xD55F14F8
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0xB9FDF16D
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x2C182C9E
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0xC5FF9758
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0xC608E1FA
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x3E1C803C
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x6B166AE4
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x6FA067A1
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xE58CFF27
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x14355508
now, if you will excuse me."
0xF3B8CA1A

0xC2C4949F
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0xEC6B722A
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x6F982C58
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x04E39131

0xC2C4949F
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x55F1D57D
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x7A20E898
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0x7CD47E9E
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x98F26796
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0x84591DEC
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0xEBDA03DC
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x6DEAD05D
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0x9DFE1C99
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0xB852F950
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0x2B9326DA
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x57395BB5
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x6039F716
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0xF6B98754
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x2D847700
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x65E16D0F
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xCFD772F7
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x0185E30B
cochere_ of the hotel.
0xA94831E5

0xC2C4949F
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0xD278C043
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0xA0B70C90
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xFDA18D36
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x3D8EE1F2
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0x8CA1AA64
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x366ECCC2
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x112A5B14
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0x0A941D5C
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x0E562D8A
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0xD32EF423
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x1D01FEE3
current--as I am now.
0xEE0959A6

0xC2C4949F
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0x518FC7B1
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xDA8D4677
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0x86CE77CC
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0xF61539B3
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x54F8C919
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xABC96675

0xC2C4949F
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x3644CFAB
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x69D6F235
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0xA43E2851

0xC2C4949F
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x463C0BCB
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0xB6DB0D8B
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x264A5012
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x99C6188D
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x74AD7038
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x785FCE86
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0x9E05CC4B
his countenance: he went on--
0x6DA81345

0xC2C4949F
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x4D9E40BF
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0xC76990B7
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x165BEC3F
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0xAB177C67
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0xA563172A
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0xE30EFC03
if you dare!'
0x6D9D5832

0xC2C4949F
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0xCD2A22F4
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x115DC3D4
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0xE8B67806
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x8425FDA6
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0x1348F477
but straw and rotten wood."
0x2EF05423

0xC2C4949F
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0xFC4D8AAF
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0xF8E5A404
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x39EDA9F6
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0xA5B64E5E

0xC2C4949F
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x2435B408

0xC2C4949F
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x9538C81B
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0xD84595B2
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xC398B522
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0x66F49FF8
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0xED0E1758
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x03752283
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x765601F1
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x210CF040
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0xB1A40C5D
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0x08DCF557
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x523233E4
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x568B572D
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x99F75E23
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0x721AD22C
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x4700D6B9
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0xCA839209
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0x6806EDA1
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0xFCA2F256
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x95E39021
After this digression he proceeded--
0x609C343C

0xC2C4949F
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x3FAF9E34
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x7BA11613
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0x6242662C
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x8BE9011E
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0xFB7DF175
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0xDBD6CE90
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0xB8CC3782
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0xA7B1885C
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x6966E0F1
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x06CF6C50
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x3477CE81
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0x65ACC8C4
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x7AB4A4E2
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xF47B463D
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x8DBB37C4
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x31F11266
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0xA42073EF
who had been her dupe.
0x3A4CEB70

0xC2C4949F
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xC844DC55
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x9EFAFDFD
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x81B59F39
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x2010125B
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0xA87EE0CB
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0x371C9F44
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x65CBA4AC
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0xA081B4D0
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0xC4DDCC40
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x8E90C898
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0x4CA1B862

0xC2C4949F
Adele here came running up again.
0xEA851A07

0xC2C4949F
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0x4E85D25D
wishes to see you."
0x5AA3DF72

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x3A7AE9EE
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0xCF39D374
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0xD05FBD99
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xA439567A
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0x52B2931B
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x8FBF5AD1
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x5D849F08
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0x6878179F
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0xFA586B72
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xDCFED04B
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xCEA9B5DC
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0xCD6118F0
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0xF73CC5EF
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x93DB6463
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x402F8B17
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x8849C21D
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0xB03A69AE
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0x39D6AB15
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0x56DE2BA3
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x5FF67BF4
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0x9CFC05B5
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0xDC82B01E

0xC2C4949F
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x32AA266A
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xAA5F986C
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x5FD754FA
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0xF1CC3BA1
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0xE546E8AF
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x79CB41E6

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0xDAFF9FE9
you too: it darkens."
0xB4816600

0xC2C4949F
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0x2DF1BF38
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x3DFA902B
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x89A6CCA5
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x9A907576
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0xC2EA9AFB
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x54A5F205
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x82CFE18F
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x8A14155D
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0xF37059F4
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0xE19D724A
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x961AC18C
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0x0813A3A0

0xC2C4949F
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x961BA32F
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0xD74BC3FE
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x83CA7B9A
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x9E26E965
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x7658FD1C
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x67D191B3
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0xCEEBC7FB
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0x7C4D09AA
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x87F00C98
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x9F5D4BC8
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x1E551F72
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x0C38178F
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xEE2A02A3
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x3DD189E8
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x81F83C2C
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0xD6ECC1D3
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x3247EAE5
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x566004D8
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x7D3E7E60
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0x06090D60
benefit.
0xFE028177

0xC2C4949F
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x0A7E1F59
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0xF9E4B083
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x0D623769
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0xEB40E8E5
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x52A81D88
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xE5B4F485
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x0062B50F
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x07F65D69
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0x2B96471A

0xC2C4949F
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0xFA90FB9D
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x262AF9FF
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x364CD3DA
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0x164A3EAE
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0x2E44CAA9
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x1195008C
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0x53A9D44E
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x16D04190

0xC2C4949F
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x758743A7
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x5D31B2D6
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0x75A1C267
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0xE44FD503
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xF2A0B9A1
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x87DE530C
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0x46F37B7E
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0x83AE0CA8
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0xB4561762
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0xFD5C6882
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x537D3B65
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x77E7092E
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0x165B7C4F
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0xF94DEB7B
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x5A9463D2
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0x3BE31E89
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x98EDCFF2
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x47066D3E
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x3466DC41

0xC2C4949F
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0xA597B633
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0x99C0B482
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0xC5AD2095
Thornfield.
0xB68CF52D

0xC2C4949F
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x394B8178
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0xEA2FB295
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x9E6F0FA4
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0xDBAC7BCF
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0xECDDF2B7

0xC2C4949F
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x3DE1F5AB
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0xBEBA315E
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0xF2DA957E
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x49CF4AA0
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x6329C770

0xC2C4949F
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x11F61010
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0xF6457672
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0xF734491D
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0xE3214D80
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x45C8E406

0xC2C4949F
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xE580C5B1
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x8D3F2986
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x663C8212
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x26C6DFB7
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xB169A0CF
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x89FC1C01
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xF7FD17F9
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x225053F0
enough.
0x6CC49932

0xC2C4949F
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0xB64CE1F7
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x658CDBCB
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x45E50555
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0xCA451CBA
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x08F09735
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xA34B84D0
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0x1E5C62E4
there?"
0x3B9BD7E3

0xC2C4949F
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0xD41D6A9C
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0xF2A0754C
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0xB6CEB2C1

0xC2C4949F
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0x156E67A5
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0xD4C3F04D
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0xB5A52D86
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x51D1C0F1
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x560DC10E
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0x2639CCF7
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xA06A878D
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0xDF46AE3C
burning.
0x0A46487E

0xC2C4949F
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x2E4CE35C
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x437503E8
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0xED2ABF70
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x3909E9ED
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x2A658CB9
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0xE59A932E

0xC2C4949F
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x5E82A8CA
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x7B3B4F29
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0x3F8B2821
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x1963F1AB
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x97372429
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x99D8D0CE
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x596BBA8A

0xC2C4949F
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0xD3E36720
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0x0999CFE2
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0xB607A220
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0x12CE85AA
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0x5075ED5E
water.
0x1BF7EB05

0xC2C4949F
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x18E1A5BA

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x091BC213
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x2C4F3DA0

0xC2C4949F
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x4BC496E0
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x0F25D0E3
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x644793B0

0xC2C4949F
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x569AC75C
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x0D9FA836

0xC2C4949F
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0xB61F1FB8
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x8D853512
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x3243309A

0xC2C4949F
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x77575570
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0xD8C04AC6
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xD5DB138B

0xC2C4949F
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x84E16D2E
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0x72F9BC45
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x5A4B8457
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x65D4579A
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xDF3F8257

0xC2C4949F
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xEFF24561

0xC2C4949F
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0xB3F3D1AB
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0x9F710FD7

0xC2C4949F
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0xD4C063EF

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0xD1206D75
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0xF426DE3B

0xC2C4949F
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xA43542B8

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xECE3F392
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0xC819B392
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0xE6AA1707
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0x8A332EA7
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x0F28D05D
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x0B12B1C5
move, remember, or call any one."
0x2ACF9A9A

0xC2C4949F
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xB5D0EBA3
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x645DD33C
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xFF3DC4BC
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0xC49013E3
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x5B2F816A
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0xA86D17AD
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0x380F5C6D
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x85944CE6
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x6BA26EB2
"and not something worse."
0x04C99BD5

0xC2C4949F
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0xF1C432F0
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x2D0AA707

0xC2C4949F
"How, sir?"
0x861E1C6E

0xC2C4949F
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x09B3922B
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0x9BC825D8

0xC2C4949F
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0x6BA011BC
door."
0xDC15C486

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0xC7CC075A

0xC2C4949F
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xC205A6E2
think, or something like it?"
0x00CDFF28

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0xCC4BD658
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x21FEDD3B

0xC2C4949F
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x48971397
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0x36D9BA55
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x97086A5D
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x52091EA7
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x7568F96D
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x51544060
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x724081AA
hours the servants will be up."
0xB5DA6764

0xC2C4949F
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x377B2A0D

0xC2C4949F
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xB51CEE8C
go.
0xCFE48D8F

0xC2C4949F
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xDFC61C40

0xC2C4949F
"You said I might go, sir."
0x27ACBE72

0xC2C4949F
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0xEA34D854
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0xBE84033B
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0x9AD22EFC
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0x3F26C317
At least shake hands."
0xDA2014F8

0xC2C4949F
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0x8BCB52AC
both his own.
0x0AEDAC22

0xC2C4949F
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0xC90B7BEA
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0xCFBD72BD
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x8CEDBCC4
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0xB1D55951

0xC2C4949F
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0xF8410A99
his voice was checked.
0x16A423FA

0xC2C4949F
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0x1C473707
in the case."
0xE7500D46

0xC2C4949F
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xB46D9C5C
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0xEEF076CF
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xCD47545C
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xD2398218
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x4C8D336D
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0xE73AF5EB

0xC2C4949F
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0xB65C1232

0xC2C4949F
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0xE69B84C0

0xC2C4949F
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x86617CAB

0xC2C4949F
"I am cold, sir."
0xE118AD90

0xC2C4949F
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x8AE9767A
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0x864F2169
expedient.
0x50C13475

0xC2C4949F
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x5EA8803F

0xC2C4949F
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x235C5477

0xC2C4949F
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x8B102B84
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x09D4783D
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xD1847964
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x75568845
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xE975FA08
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x2E285401
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0xE5911304
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x1DEB6DBE

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XVI
0xF8B973E0

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0xC11E44CB
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xF3AA9CD8
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x918BCCD7
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x15D312E8
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0x4871A3B9
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x1C67E219

0xC2C4949F
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x246D5529
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xA4DC4583
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x90F5F947
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0xA9056423
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xA3A360E0
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x85F13CE1
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xEE65ACDC
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xFA0776DB
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x5D71C759

0xC2C4949F
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0xAB09E310
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0x73662F56
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0xE32CF2C9
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x6C625DAD
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0xE62482B2
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0x6297FE7C
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0x7DFCE463
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x57B3DA97
no other than Grace Poole.
0xE8FAB255

0xC2C4949F
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x3B5CCA02
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x1A199F5D
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0xE43E5D66
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xFD71001B
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x6723B45F
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0xE16890A8
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0x91536445
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x46A4EC9B
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x5A6795DD
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x4FD67B2C
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x3DAA414F
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0xBC960D59
went on with her sewing.
0x9C167FD5

0xC2C4949F
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0x136ABF21
is past comprehension."
0x9DED6216

0xC2C4949F
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x559D8E6B
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x003CE5F8

0xC2C4949F
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x42A829B6
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xFAFB1BD1
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0x2BF030AA
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x1AA3BCA3

0xC2C4949F
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0xADF21EAB
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0xA8063BB1

0xC2C4949F
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0xD4596C62
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x0A0F966C
she answered--
0x29630357

0xC2C4949F
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0xF7F7DD91
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0x36089F92
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x3EEF47F5
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0x183E797E
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0xA48E8441
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0xF610D077
a noise?"
0x4D1971A9

0xC2C4949F
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0xD360A5CC
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0x6749342A
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0xD52912EC

0xC2C4949F
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0xA118FDCA
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x749CE568

0xC2C4949F
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0xF24D73C7
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x40560974

0xC2C4949F
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0xF4F085FE
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0xA3A39626
conscious eye.
0x62F6ED00

0xC2C4949F
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xF6553B44

0xC2C4949F
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xCF9EF8AB

0xC2C4949F
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x6737AE4E
gallery?" she further asked.
0xE7D57C19

0xC2C4949F
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x7246E51B
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x4859BA26
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0xDB9B06DF
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0x18046A07

0xC2C4949F
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x0B5AAFD3

0xC2C4949F
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x65C9CC06
you get into bed?"
0x348EDF4D

0xC2C4949F
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x9DCF5895
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x01EAB138
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0xA085F80F
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0xFE495623
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0xC33763FF
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0xC80F7E0F
lie down."
0x5CFD18D3

0xC2C4949F
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x32E3F73A
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0x82B2ACF4
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0x980902D2
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0xE3932C58
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x08FE1F54
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x3807E997
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0xA8DCC83C
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x1D83E045
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x51359479
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xE1C00A71
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0xE485784B
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x26E15BC0
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x96DC9429

0xC2C4949F
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x74645EDC
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0xD6BBF110
entered.
0x2CB61D58

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0xA69F2555
be ready: will you come down?"
0x44B1379D

0xC2C4949F
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0xFD3DE815
carry it upstairs."
0x8004784E

0xC2C4949F
"You'll have some meat?"
0x4A3D524C

0xC2C4949F
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0xC79C65F0

0xC2C4949F
"And the sago?"
0x9F3BEDA0

0xC2C4949F
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0xD790ADE4
make it myself."
0xBFE462E4

0xC2C4949F
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x0ACF8C11
so I departed.
0xF64EA913

0xC2C4949F
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x8ADB2B69
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x8493A5AA
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x3E6F7883
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0xAFCD9435
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x366A73FC
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xE200D1D7
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x6A98CCD5
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x63DFBEEA
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0xF8C4D71C
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0x8052F7D1
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x69DE4EC0
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x345DCB69

0xC2C4949F
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0xF7C7FBD4
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x03255810
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xA7376799
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x1BBAE1BA
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0x9399B3F5
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x0339A641
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0xC5AC6BD3
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xA2669FB1
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x8AD0E515
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0xB63C1B67
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xA9EAC802
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0xC3B3D070
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0xFF64BBE3
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0xE7A5C942
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0xB05FB00B
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x38AC1BA0
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x7FC16083
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0xFC06AFEC
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0xE80BB95C
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xCF6FBC38

0xC2C4949F
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x0F12BBE1
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x19AD5886
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0xFFA0364D

0xC2C4949F
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x5FF9ADE8
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0x253EB3DD

0xC2C4949F
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xEA16739E
thinking.
0x09D615E4

0xC2C4949F
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x1998DB5D
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0x5CF67A76
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x6161C98F
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0x0F8E2712
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0xC75EBFAC
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0x2886208E

0xC2C4949F
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0x9386E4E1
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x4BACCDF4
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xDABF4B55
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x54E87FCC
impatient."
0x9B8646EC

0xC2C4949F
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0xC40205DC
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x485E43C6
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x62278CFE
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0xFABCBD12
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x85BAFEB8
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0xB76B189A
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x5681147C
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0xE43EB95F
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0xA9FB36BC
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0xD89B5BF4
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x125934A1
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x9DB6EA5A
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x5169FA96
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x67329FE6
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0x2EDEAB3E
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0xBE9AF086
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0xD4C84C8C
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x9DAB113C
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x2B7DC660

0xC2C4949F
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x8FB49E45
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x1D9BBF75
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x044520C4
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x7B96F901

0xC2C4949F
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x5D374AE6
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0x812F4BBB
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x5BA65CF3

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x159D910B

0xC2C4949F
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x52768EDD
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x3424EC88
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0xEBFA176C
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0xF1924F1B
deepening into total obscurity.
0xEB6A9484

0xC2C4949F
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0xD118A8D4
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x5F359845
his journey."
0xA929A31E

0xC2C4949F
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0xD405E3C1

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x034F7A35
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x1A884649
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0xD390C3AC
Colonel Dent, and others."
0xC7DACB10

0xC2C4949F
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0xC6693296

0xC2C4949F
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xD74776C2
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0xE71A45BE
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x75C5D8B7
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x5C6D6520
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0xF64AE1A0
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xF81C2883
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x29421AF1
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x4DCA6E61
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xA699E62B
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x758FF9F5

0xC2C4949F
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0x0DAFFD25

0xC2C4949F
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0xCB311374
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x8DC45205
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x796D03A7
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x40C40D50
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x68346F4E
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xCFE28954
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x978C383C
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xA3BEDF89
the evening."
0x3BC786A3

0xC2C4949F
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x6DF28C5D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0xC4EA065D
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xE44D7676
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xC269C75F
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0xAEC586BA
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x96B1C663
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x1D386CF3
was certainly the queen."
0x92A838C9

0xC2C4949F
"And what was she like?"
0x06F6FA9F

0xC2C4949F
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xC428CDCE
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0xD0AF339A
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0x7685B3D7
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x642BF16C
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x5168FAD1
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0x2DC7B5FF
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0xE699E8B7
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x6F679EEA
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x03D8B190
jetty mass of her curls."
0x851D3E53

0xC2C4949F
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x3D371243

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x2C6A23E3
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x373741A4
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x24769805

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0xE5F1784A

0xC2C4949F
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0xEBF12BCA

0xC2C4949F
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0xE09B969C

0xC2C4949F
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0x4C11AF57
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x7DAEFBEC
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x618C0EC7

0xC2C4949F
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0x6BD9ECCB

0xC2C4949F
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0xD1EC73C9
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0x65133BC9
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0x7AAE2630

0xC2C4949F
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x843FAA7C
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x1805FC5F

0xC2C4949F
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x3F363BE7
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0xCA8A766F

0xC2C4949F
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0x308240F5

0xC2C4949F
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0x3CDF0420
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0x0FC3D28D
began tea."
0x083A1FE3

0xC2C4949F
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0xE33AC601

0xC2C4949F
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x19162475
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x3E0418EC
conversation was turned into another channel.
0xDB0282DC

0xC2C4949F
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0xCC13C862
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x0F01F710
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x0346A4C4
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0xA3851E93

0xC2C4949F
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x6773C1B2
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x16F22155
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x89BB0E0E
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x4D947619
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x8AC06306
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x3377D1E0

0xC2C4949F
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x9CF6C4A9
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x0601596E
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x4D8CF5F2

0xC2C4949F
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xAEE518F5
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0x74FE8C29
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0xEE83DA7C
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x1EB9D08B
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x22010D09
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0xD5AA6BFA
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xA16D034B
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0x1B3C8C6E
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0xD28D0CA5
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0x43A89F3B
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x18AE4842
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x01140E7B
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0xD7576CC4
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0xC25C0B12
is no extrication.
0xE24F42C3

0xC2C4949F
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0xEDAC748B
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0x3FD4A79D
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0xE7C1C2FC
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x9FE62980
poor, and plain.'
0x4CC65E6F

0xC2C4949F
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0xA7ACF217
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0x98585BAF
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0xA02F7BE4
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xCB21CC29
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x704CBBDF
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x12BF68B6
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x31469650
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x54036CAF
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0xB9AAF4D3
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0xBA3D64C3
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x98966CE0
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0x1F5624E8
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xD870D11A

0xC2C4949F
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0xA020AD1F
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0xA3B40BD8
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0xF6639B5B
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x9987CCB2
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x9429907E

0xC2C4949F
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x300DE283
calm, and fell asleep.
0x4C39EEB0

0xC2C4949F
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0x37D2FD6B
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x691A1C44
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x9EDF442A
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x27B47673
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0xBDABA4D2
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0xF5AFC503
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x430886FE

0xC2C4949F
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0xCA36931E
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x55FEA504
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x756E1F60
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0xCDCA42E7
maintain, even externally.
0x1909E8D6

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XVII
0x70E98F50

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xFAE654D1
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0x460DAD2B
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0x97D595CE
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xC3611F13
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0x8FB2C660
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x7F7B205A
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0x8C042C6D
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x9647FDBB
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xC3913C23
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x2B26FB55
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x08B4CE29
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xB28382ED
on the contrary, I just said--
0xC3C5BF72

0xC2C4949F
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x318011D8
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0xF053ACDE
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0x1DE22021
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x0E9FE88F
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x07615349
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xED80E4FD
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0xA70C4D93
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0xCC02EC69
wanted and would be despised."
0xE11845EA

0xC2C4949F
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0x0842EA71
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0xCA3F44E4
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0xC85505C9
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x93E85E40
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0xE9492B6D

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x10F35DF5
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x3AA339FB

0xC2C4949F
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x022FF0FB
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x5FE67651

0xC2C4949F
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0xE6ED46DC
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x61C95D38
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x18C2432C
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0x1284FB2F
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0x0C611AD4

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x77895C83
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0xD1DF887A
holding the note before her spectacles.
0xB0F25B51

0xC2C4949F
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x478861D2
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x43D43489
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0xAF7EEE81

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0xA5AF7531

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x0AEC8DC5
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x06A34A26
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x6FBD5C64
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0xA1F7105C
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x9DFFA73D
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0xC940A7F3
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x4D1036EA
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x62F43DF9

0xC2C4949F
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0xA0FAA6AE
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x8C00E291
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x0F63FE4B
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x1872F945
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x00D039C6
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xCA2DB4E0
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0xE3ED0C0A
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0xB827124D
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x9A3C0ECD
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x5B0FB77B
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0xF72C0645
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0xAAD33AD8
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x94E0A796
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x3879F254
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x5687BB21
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0xEB5EFD8E
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x959498F0
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x24A2606A

0xC2C4949F
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0xBF86CE8B
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x9F5F90CB
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x34867550
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x36A72403
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0xC82436BA
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x78428DD9
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x90573D5F
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x006C0A6E
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0x7E84FA2C
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x2BB44B77
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x105C0E6E
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0xE1288889
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x921DF584
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0xC169BE48
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0xE279FE4A
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0xEF404FFF
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x8E8DE6AF
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0xF1E5CB1A
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x12875DA2
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0xA34E7355

0xC2C4949F
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x76DEA7B3
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0xA723D72C
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x1350C0A9
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0xCE57F82B
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0xDA402769
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0xCDD75758

0xC2C4949F
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0xA80B799D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0x881E71CF
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0xEBC6075C
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0x84B0452E
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0x49146C21
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x9E6AED4F
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xBA3A2ABA
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0xD971643C

0xC2C4949F
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0xC75E0A3C

0xC2C4949F
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0xCA7A0F22
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0x3665F153
the money she gets."
0xAC70DB88

0xC2C4949F
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x45472A05

0xC2C4949F
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0xDE471EA9
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0xF4B98F5B

0xC2C4949F
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x679F4E7B

0xC2C4949F
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x63BC0138
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0x7738A94F
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0xD3835572
excluded.
0x5C0DFE22

0xC2C4949F
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xFCE3F449
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x64472E63
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xB39019E6
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0xE75AC92D
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x1868D162
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x8569F675
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x75BE1CAD
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0x50C3E7E3
sides.
0xBBC0033D

0xC2C4949F
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x3C51B668
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xD5D54673
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0xBAC1F105
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0x5F80C696
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0xE1F42D26
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x099D141A
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x5EB5BB26
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0xBD495850
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0xA690CA87

0xC2C4949F
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0xD3700DF6
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0xA734DACD
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x5BD9C6F6
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0xFF14C189

0xC2C4949F
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0x94D55D31
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x4BD9AD8C
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0x8B6D6F23
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x8BB428F4
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x568FF733
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x08D2AE93

0xC2C4949F
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x13FC9238
minutes."
0x947F4CBC

0xC2C4949F
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x7EB82FCB
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x4099D061

0xC2C4949F
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0xA4FF362E
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x3295F697
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0xC9A81751
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xDBE6E330
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0xD0DA744A
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xE2B02D4B
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x007DF5AF
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0xC2DC1168
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0x7390BBD2

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xD9B03108
below.
0x968B5E2C

0xC2C4949F
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0xE8CEB28B
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x17403342
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x7B5502DD
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0x5375ACBB
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0xA5158A9E
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x00C1A9D3
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x95742A04

0xC2C4949F
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x23BD72FA
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x4806A23E
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0x109098FE
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x53C0852B
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x1FD8420C
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x3F140F34
and, for a time, a hush.
0xF3EA8F72

0xC2C4949F
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x9179E220
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x6F365AC6

0xC2C4949F
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0x32BDE8D2
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x95688E0D
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0xBD54B82E
on apprend."
0xD6878E45

0xC2C4949F
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0xDDA2D99A

0xC2C4949F
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xEA7602F2
mange."
0x6F077F59

0xC2C4949F
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xDB85BD9C
get you something to eat."
0x90750DA6

0xC2C4949F
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x9AA47845
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0x12A8E578
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x038E7B97
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0x2BB357E6
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x1E86C926
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0xAA1EE4BE
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x6CE8A364
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0xAC25FD31
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x0B4D0A42
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0x011150CF
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x801396C0
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x8F61DE65
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0x461C125A
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0xFE136FD1
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x4DF8B642
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x7EDD523E
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x887ED974

0xC2C4949F
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x6B6B1B2A
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x03F4AF68
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x1F583E36
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x01761603
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0xB250C707
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0x6350C1D8
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x5670395C

0xC2C4949F
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x7E181B1B
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0xE4C24318
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0xCA021756
dinner?"
0xBCE1B000

0xC2C4949F
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0xD789A543
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x66799AE7
is your dinner."
0x92C9F9E1

0xC2C4949F
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x8FC8091D
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x5F8BF717
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0xFD58AB0D
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x6ADFAF26
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x3CDAEF5F
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0xFA885AAA
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x5F4ADBE8
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x86F573F5
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0x0F90DD86
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0x08F93E8F
quel dommage!"
0x5FB7E4FB

0xC2C4949F
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x2D580972
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x1104D7EF
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x373D1E1D
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0x20C8C171
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x58BCFDC4
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x157E6A33
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0xC7EF874F
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0xEEB60A8B
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0xE48FA833
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x93A48267
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x51950419
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0xC1C662C0
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0xF93C7657
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xCACCD779

0xC2C4949F
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x9B5F5EF2
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0xA428F7FD
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0xB56F5F89
sought their chambers.
0x97E4E717

0xC2C4949F
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0xE0B358ED
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0x79BC0608
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x13269AC0
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x078DA0A8
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x9CD7DA06
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x122B10EA
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0xB07C779A

0xC2C4949F
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x7C716BFA
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x3E23C65F
ladies."
0x2818EFDF

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x0717478D

0xC2C4949F
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0x05BA12F4
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xBF867E98
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x90A9F963

0xC2C4949F
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x1DA7467B
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0xD29AC987
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0xA61DE690
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0x3667F8DE

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0xDB8D4E7F
answered.
0x26D46DAB

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0xE81C0961
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x728A5914
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x7A9B9A03
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xCA34A750
case of contumacy.'"
0xA3052F58

0xC2C4949F
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0xF570F3D9
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0xF1D581A1

0xC2C4949F
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0xB063E08F
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xADE4CA44
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xE6C7DA01
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0x642801FA
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xAA7B4644
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x6852315F
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x94001FB1

0xC2C4949F
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x27FE0F66

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0xEF2D9539
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x2F6848FE
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x50F90E92
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0xB12D421D
stay at Thornfield."
0xBE4F235F

0xC2C4949F
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0xC4064383
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x7326BFF0
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0xA766B56D
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x4CA10B26
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x5635A180
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0xCE96E34F
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xCB7E4EA1
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0xE142A9F1
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0xAC4B5669
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0x676B0BA1
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x389BE69F
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xFC4CFFCE
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x33650BC5
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0x6A93503E
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0xAB48BF86
descended.
0x9D59741B

0xC2C4949F
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x4D5EEFC1
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x8D07B1F2
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0xCFEF1E0D
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0x3635AECE
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xA97774D2
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x80DA901C
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x9D23A313
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x0D136DAB

0xC2C4949F
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0xDD75CF44
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xCA55D23A
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x5DAE988D
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xC9EEBA28
touched my knee.
0xE7EE3AEE

0xC2C4949F
"What is it, Adele?"
0xD8CBA7F4

0xC2C4949F
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x2851D594
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x69A9F054

0xC2C4949F
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x80ECC9F4
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0xD07732C3
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0xF58BE725
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0xC506A661
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x6FA2148F
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x331A57B4

0xC2C4949F
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xD62892E2
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0xB43AF59B
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x5E284F5F
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x54540F3D
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x41A8CD2B

0xC2C4949F
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x0BC60E77
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xAA54BB37
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x61ADCC21
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0x17758E2D
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x33001701
stared at me.
0xEF3A2F77

0xC2C4949F
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x2DCDF6D5
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0x2EC7B3AB
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0xB0A3A84F
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x5E1814E1
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x0CA9C3C2
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x878617D8
and may as well mention them now.
0x841153F9

0xC2C4949F
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0x7B9D1373
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x6116EE3D
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0x0110A85B
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0xD3B42EE7
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0xD686811E
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x2AEC54F7
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x1B5C701A

0xC2C4949F
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x534B7BBA
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0xB4AE7E1E
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0xB2C3CBF8
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x4FC2104E

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xFE778A9C
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0xE97554AB
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x27112F38
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xFECF5C5F

0xC2C4949F
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x6BDBE9AA
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0xA4571B34
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x80F17418
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0xFBE19911
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x3BDE99AE
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0xC370742D
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0x7CD0B70A
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x909C80D0
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x5D63CAA2
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0xE0661EB6
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0xD4BD36DC
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0x13111E8E
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0xC6D6B532
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0xFDE466E0
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0x1B5CCA7A
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x91EB87FE
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xA13B8B6A
truly imperial dignity.
0x501EE230

0xC2C4949F
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x5564119D
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x27437A85
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0xD7A715F0
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0x04DD167E
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0x22AE59B6
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0xDA56A6DF
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0xECD3D0C5

0xC2C4949F
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0xA58F02C9
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x377764DE
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0xE000528B
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xC2F94A7C
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x1C7476DD
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x53FD6D39
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x9578A127
haughty lip.
0x1A3FFF0B

0xC2C4949F
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x461B13CC
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x265A082D
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x652C8F34
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x0532FEF6
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x28E8CD64
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0x969EEE19
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x7CFA72B8
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x7AE6AECF
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0xC0120668
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xF35828AA
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x5848EB9B

0xC2C4949F
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x9B149A8E
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x88DDAA6A
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x1D94EFD3
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0x21AF1614
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x7BC8AFB8
in spotless white.
0xA7A625E5

0xC2C4949F
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0x4AC6897E
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x1F6FE9C4
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x3A8450A5
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x346A08EB
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x32A222EB
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x5FADB909
together.
0x0E0A222F

0xC2C4949F
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x7882A9CB
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x7E2B5A80
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x7D38B623
gravity--
0x95E6EA1E

0xC2C4949F
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xD0F1393C

0xC2C4949F
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x930CDA71
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0xB63D9326

0xC2C4949F
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x506005C6
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x62F4FBA0

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x21F61953

0xC2C4949F
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x0AC45B78
child!"
0x21CF02E6

0xC2C4949F
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0x303B1CDB
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x425ACED7
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x4E6EE410
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x54A5B15D

0xC2C4949F
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xFE941487
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x5D9E1F9D
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x38E181D6
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0x1E593D18
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x912AD5EF
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0xC3E15436
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0xC2EC2458
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0xBA0520DD
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x276645A9
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x9C9D484F
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x7CED674A
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0xEB7F457D
blood or vigour of brain.
0xA3F37365

0xC2C4949F
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x1208BB37

0xC2C4949F
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x351D574D
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x11D78275
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0xCE4BF352
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x402445C2
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x425400C3
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x8DDAE870
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x7759E07B
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xAE40D60A
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0xCD74D371
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0x6EB81417
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x560B79BB
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xF8372F64
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x49F25601
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x20E08A7E

0xC2C4949F
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x6B379C68
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0xDD6F7E08
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x124B6612
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0xCBC8920C
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0x465FA018
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x2AD2AEEB
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xA61D2699
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x5D27E3F2

0xC2C4949F
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x803AD0A2
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x8138DCC5
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x4B0AC3BC
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x653C9DBA
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x97AF0B2C
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x9855415B
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0xFF987B1F
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x432E1892
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x99ADD87E
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x256AF673

0xC2C4949F
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x5DD45541
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xB79AEB27
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x58ED437E
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0xB0D2F2B8
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0x8E0F7A96
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0x99E6CA31
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x503131C7
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0x32DB7A7B
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x4A9D2D69
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x6627591B
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0xA6B1AA7C
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x3F44ABCC
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x29A85DD4
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x1287C4C5
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x1FD15817
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0xBCAC6D0B
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0x70DB76D2
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xACF0CE20
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x228B7F5C
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x34C1F2AA
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x6E80B8B6
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0xD77A4DAA
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0xE073B99A
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0x804FB61C
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xC5EEB18B
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0xD2E07A94
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0xE3704C17
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x9FA2FF92
breathe and think, I must love him."
0x380FC156

0xC2C4949F
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x372285BE
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x575D736B
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x3D1F97A5
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x0C04F245
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x0707A356
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0xB0902400
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0x71125CD4
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0xD318C38C
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x43463DFE
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x9B79AFC1
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0xB56CC2ED
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0x12D04810
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0x1B80F3BD
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0xD500F21B
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x9F0AA40E
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xB705B01E
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0xD06AF2ED
selects a mate.
0x87FDAB3C

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x059EEE4C
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x9DDC8D3C
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0x9DEBD296

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x81EA04B5

0xC2C4949F
"Nor am I."
0x87F87678

0xC2C4949F
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0xCB76E34A
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x3CE7B4A7

0xC2C4949F
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x1E8FA521

0xC2C4949F
"You should have sent her to school."
0x93AE0136

0xC2C4949F
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0x83F1090A

0xC2C4949F
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0x05F5202E
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x62A04117
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x5A9B1404
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0x45D5B3FB

0xC2C4949F
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xEBCDCA5E
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x5B55743B
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0xACDC62EB

0xC2C4949F
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0x47CFF853
straight before him.
0x2DC717F3

0xC2C4949F
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0x2FACE2E9
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0x5DA2AE2E
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0xFB45DE9D
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0xCA3C78D6

0xC2C4949F
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x64F3F3A0

0xC2C4949F
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x9E1BC2A9
her question with an explanation.
0x857A1255

0xC2C4949F
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0x5F8058C5
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x30B4484D
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0x1FCFB3EF

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0xD729DFBE
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0x1E5C8D22
the anathematised race was present.
0xC489528E

0xC2C4949F
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0x2DF490FF
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0x5FA172F6
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x63DBB6E7

0xC2C4949F
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0xFFB0490D

0xC2C4949F
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x3226D7D9
three times with portentous significancy.
0x4DDBCAB4

0xC2C4949F
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0xBE7ABFB7

0xC2C4949F
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0xA3D41411

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x95B8D6DE
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x6F7C9BD5
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0xD821FBE7
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x7A00F8A7
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x91EB542C
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x2AE3AE6B
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x5FE45CEA
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x50CD99A3
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x8A971CA4
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x7F64A2B5
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0xD34B5CD3
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0x1ED3AAA7

0xC2C4949F
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0x2B899D97
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x0A4F3975
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x23BE1A15
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x07150658

0xC2C4949F
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x9B53EDB5
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x7CBAE197
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0xA66B73BF
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0xDBCD907F
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0xA77782CD
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0x5324F637
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0x63F6B2F6
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0x146B2FA1
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0x7738F610
lady-mother?"
0xA4294C01

0xC2C4949F
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0x8EEE71E1
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x11053CDD
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0x8F6DE488

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0xC29F61B5
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0xD98A628C
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0x0758B488
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0x757314CD
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0xE38D4743

0xC2C4949F
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0x0F05A6C2

0xC2C4949F
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0xDD19C6B5

0xC2C4949F
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x64A77A3C
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0x0A404732
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x3A4A418B
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0x5B4E3485

0xC2C4949F
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0xFABB4C9F
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x49D4E45F
she would give us anything we asked for."
0x109C2795

0xC2C4949F
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0xB33F9D32
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0x963A5B33
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0x71537859
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0x2628E216

0xC2C4949F
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x2613474E

0xC2C4949F
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x32C3011B
in voice to-night?"
0xD11A70D6

0xC2C4949F
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0x48F166AD

0xC2C4949F
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0x20A25261
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0xC25432F1

0xC2C4949F
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0xC69549E4

0xC2C4949F
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0x20563249
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xECF446F2
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x48901CA1
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0xCAFD46B3
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x299D671E
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xD4391573
hand."
0x32E4EE6D

0xC2C4949F
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0xE106CE8C
Mr. Rochester.
0xDA2E16CC

0xC2C4949F
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0x3BDA3961

0xC2C4949F
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0x74AC166A

0xC2C4949F
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0xA12B939A
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x2F681B5D
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0xA3149CCC
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x0BD694BC
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x5D80F563
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0xF9440233

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x9BB26708
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0xCB9A55F9
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0xFF89EA86
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x9E41D46C
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x079AB5EB
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0x0D54B45F
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x3BDE4C46
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x58221890
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x2110AA81
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0xA23A6021
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0xC3C6AA00

0xC2C4949F
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x94F33D12
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x5C4DCC6F
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0x6E5C7C71
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0xFB7D331F
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0xAD59EA8F

0xC2C4949F
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x00DB462D

0xC2C4949F
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0x6F0A1DC3
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0x7FE7549C

0xC2C4949F
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0x21F0389A
water."
0x217FED65

0xC2C4949F
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0x1DE7F094
such things _should_ be done."
0x130E2848

0xC2C4949F
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0xEC6F123B
fail."
0x9CC1AF20

0xC2C4949F
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0xD72E039D
proportionate punishment."
0x12D86471

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x586BE5C1
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0x78BFD417

0xC2C4949F
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xBB637B89

0xC2C4949F
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0xAF62045B
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0xBCAF5FA7
capital punishment."
0x34827A59

0xC2C4949F
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x0678B8CD
accompaniment in spirited style.
0xA7DD2C35

0xC2C4949F
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0xD44B9D57
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0xCED4EE2B
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0xDFC826BF
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0x0F1395B5
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x5E515904
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x6431CA1F
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0xE9878B2D
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x301B6D38
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x9ABBB534
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0xE034299B
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0x5A5EC9EB
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x51248F74

0xC2C4949F
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x5E25B537

0xC2C4949F
"I am very well, sir."
0x70319827

0xC2C4949F
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x64A213B8

0xC2C4949F
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x1B300836
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0xFF2A4945

0xC2C4949F
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0xA18ED6A4

0xC2C4949F
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x5CAEFADE

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x241375D4

0xC2C4949F
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x3D7AE9F1
What is the matter?"
0x1D90C121

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x1C197B29

0xC2C4949F
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x1F673F24

0xC2C4949F
"Not the least."
0xE561E4FF

0xC2C4949F
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x15B47095

0xC2C4949F
"I am tired, sir."
0x99149F29

0xC2C4949F
He looked at me for a minute.
0x281DD9FA

0xC2C4949F
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x7EE6792A

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x35CB79B1

0xC2C4949F
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0xA8E7F9DE
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x908533C4
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x075A3C72
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0xF9BB4E0E
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0x93B64925
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x45140858
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0xCFCEE5D5
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x5FDB1245
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
0xBCADFA63

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XVIII
0x43B4E93E

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x665BAB33
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x308D21BD
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x79E7B618
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0xFFFA3C26
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x7126CE65
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0xA723D712
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x20736FCB

0xC2C4949F
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xBFA85670
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xCC317413
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0xB2461B01
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x26F50C57
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xB3A24F0A
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x91784D37
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0xDA4A47BC

0xC2C4949F
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x395EFBAA
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x76358C29
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x3F172F21
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x003F8D7F
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0x6DA60214
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x3817912A
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x84D66814
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x63B1E17A
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x581BB2F7
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x95C143A1
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x0760EAB4
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0xA8845ADD
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x143C6BE7
drawing-room.
0xAC3C596C

0xC2C4949F
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x3D541098
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0xECE5F3A7
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x6503E866
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0xBB6CFF57
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x1656D4C2

0xC2C4949F
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0xCD354873
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0xCFE46D75
usual seat.
0xFCDA93EC

0xC2C4949F
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x0655E273
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0xFE9174D5
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0x3F6768AF
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x07DB3872

0xC2C4949F
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x3085C9DA

0xC2C4949F
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xD1C8853E
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x1357F02F
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xFBFEE617
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x4F096F3C
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0x852FD8F6
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x7BD1413C
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0xF1C5A36B
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0x3CD88BB4
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0xF0EF0705
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x7FDEF4B6
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x4B8F19AA
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x1585B59F
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0xBCA54FA3
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x2055EECE
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0xC10B6339

0xC2C4949F
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xEC91CB18

0xC2C4949F
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0x1CEA00FF
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x0BA733AC
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x1A70124D
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x69053D75
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0xCD2C10AF
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x5E01F92F
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x45C32008
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x30EB5531

0xC2C4949F
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0xF0B323EC
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x3B83A9B0
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x2ECB1C11
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x92D5D102
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xF658151F
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x7656AD9A
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x05AC8A11
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x6C1FBD1B
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0x4F23AD76
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x46896287
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0x466F7231
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x7156F4DD

0xC2C4949F
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x524BFFB7
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x65643BD9
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x9BFB06C4
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xC756F1A6
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x3D35DCF4
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xC88236F1
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x1A8A11BB
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x066470BC
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x1C686EEC
wanting.
0x4269C037

0xC2C4949F
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0xF5D24252
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0xA195424F
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x072293F9
curtain again descended.
0xDE6429D6

0xC2C4949F
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x25DC7C19
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0xB32FB0BE
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0xB6551D2E
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0xD91D19AC
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0x5D252B55

0xC2C4949F
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x74A9628D
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0xCD89CC0F
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0xE6213445
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0x82D5390D
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0x3CF32E05
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x4C394C32
attached fetters.
0x5638EE34

0xC2C4949F
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0xC26D5BD6

0xC2C4949F
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0xED28671F
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x7D5CBBBA
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x7715581B

0xC2C4949F
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x8379865C
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x697E54A5
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x0D700947

0xC2C4949F
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0xE943F2B3

0xC2C4949F
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0xCB7FBF59
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x1BACB03F

0xC2C4949F
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0x155E499B

0xC2C4949F
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0xCB9AAA4E
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x597CA184

0xC2C4949F
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xE1FB0643
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xCD01C59A
colour rose.
0xC07B0B47

0xC2C4949F
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0x39967427
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0xDC9BC434
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0xAD86FB69
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x217996E1
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0xE8AFB47D
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0x3B1C4DDF
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x1895E158
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0x3AD1DD8B
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0x05A87CD7
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0xD01BFFD1
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0x796F5AE0
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x37DD49CB
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xF1D098CE
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x4B589C5C
returns in memory at this moment.
0x91545878

0xC2C4949F
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0xE990796D
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x9F241076
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x4580DFDB
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0xFB1CFF82
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0x52CA2600
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x2C4A1D85
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0xD38C9D70
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0xEF570A22
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0x8EA661B6
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x69B04E5B
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x497332B4
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0xC8B11B99
very pride, irresistible.
0xC6A9BCFB

0xC2C4949F
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xA0AFEDA0
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x074A6C13
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x05525B96
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0xF78B6768
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0xA6E8C242
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0xC0F5EF61
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0x65C6A3EB
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0xD429C031
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0xCEA194EE
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x67254F17
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x8C810978
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0x31F33670
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0xBDB0C4A1
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0xF2A38D0E
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0xD1A02D63
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0x3E82D9F0
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x219894AE
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x9363F7A2
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0x9498432B
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0xB000F043
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0x76F6EEEB
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x5AACD95E
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0xDA2E05F8
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0xD65FB4A3
torturing pain arose.
0x51DE5733

0xC2C4949F
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x62418D61
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0x0A1B80AC
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0xE5A5CEDA
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0xB1EBFA1F
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x6F46A64D
not charm him_.
0xE7FEC7CF

0xC2C4949F
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0xC9179A8B
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x7BB5C157
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x1D1420FC
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0xCDBD17BF
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0xAE70C98C
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0xCEE61E09
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x36F71AB5
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0xA8C0A9F6
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0xD80C28BD
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0xBCC8C33C
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x64A5F986
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0x4D6C03E7
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x3CAA0E93
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x8576AEAA
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x8E423F91

0xC2C4949F
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xF66CCC73
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0x30FD3ACF
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0x67FF9F25
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x6E629361
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x16B9669D
silent conquest might have been won.
0xA3CFFBFE

0xC2C4949F
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xF7FCC017
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0xD4502F90
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0xB66D66D8
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0xB4B2213F
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0x5BEBB3ED
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xE7FDD976
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xB7C56125
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x459F9948
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0xD7AA23EB
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0x511DABA6
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0xFF861D35
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0xBF248AEF
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xDDDE52E3
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x6771379D
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x8B850F60
shines on."
0x0566CF74

0xC2C4949F
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x02D05B10
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0xBE3BF0A0
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xF326A438
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xC21450C9
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x68E06B26
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0xA435500E
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0xBA19389A
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x7FFAED21
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x7047E50E
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x7CF2901F
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xE8F6810D
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x2E982D55
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x1A7E3BDE
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x156F9D0B
as I wished to act.
0x58F41912

0xC2C4949F
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0xC142033F
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x56070D0A
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x42E9B99D
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x70A2EC5A
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x78A45459
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x22321817
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x0E2A987F
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x29A6E342
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x6EBAB812
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x225C6EFA
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x89F8E52F
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x170A0FEC
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x48F4F877
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0xCAE0E482
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x7F72806A
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0xE64D42EB
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x62228C6C
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0xB3376E2D
nature.
0x5C0440F5

0xC2C4949F
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x2F82C3B0
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0x4039C3BD
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x2AE66403
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0xAB5C2B04
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x731C63F4
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0xF5853EE3
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0xCEE33482
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x330C0B9E
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x18309D48
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xBAF386A9
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0xFA35318A
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x4D2B23A9
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x9D39C782
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xE83E883F
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0xF0F4C60D
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x50922022
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0xD3983449
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x5DC2958B
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x879CD193
vivacity of conversation.
0x5AF28F58

0xC2C4949F
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x23AB7CAA
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x9C497E32
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x0B362CCA
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0xAF68950A
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x3940426C
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0xDDF26A5A
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x11E43770
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0x1263B6D5
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0x5D8E3705
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0x025C0D04
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x1A7FDA81
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0xF21D7D85
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xE510FF2B
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0xE0A26958
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x6357BDC9

0xC2C4949F
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x82068EF1
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0xE262A702
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x5C9EE282

0xC2C4949F
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x9B72D2EF

0xC2C4949F
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0xE9B0372E
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0xB1F7FE9D
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xA4346074
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x695727DB

0xC2C4949F
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x74789B07
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x0F11EF73
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x2C15D74E

0xC2C4949F
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x52183D38
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x825B810B
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0xA7A1E5BF
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x0AE966A6
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0xB7E577F2
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0x4397369C
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0x011433C2

0xC2C4949F
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x58445BC1
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0xAF2F04E8
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xFC40BA16

0xC2C4949F
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0x1F561B3C
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xDF4B1C46

0xC2C4949F
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0x234C5537
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x52FF380B
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x826C1135
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0xD4974096

0xC2C4949F
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0xE155BE0D
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x1A3E6D80
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x88AC4E15
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0xAB678FBD
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x311FC9A9
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x07FCE7ED
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x25E17397
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x8BF59A18
least so I thought.
0xF019309B

0xC2C4949F
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x84223546
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xFFD6D1A6
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x0BA8F44F
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xBF6290DC
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0xE7CEFB47
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0xFEA9B790
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x1D777B86
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x53B0D7DF
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0x0BC07862
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0xCDA3A700

0xC2C4949F
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x437CBA98
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0xB95B6A4A
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x17F10D41
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0xB90D60EF
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x13BB2040
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x5E6EC163
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x9B7B193A

0xC2C4949F
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xA7EE2BD6
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x83B8AFBA
that "extremes meet."
0x9AF09623

0xC2C4949F
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0x7F976116
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0xA991D4FC
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0xBCAF75AF
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x750880EE
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x1CB813F1
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x1D266D01
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x45CF444B
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x024B3A2E

0xC2C4949F
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x92B42257
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0xF0EE35BA
a placid eye and smile!"
0x72C97910

0xC2C4949F
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x6E05F522
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x14BC3D67
Hay Common.
0x69C14020

0xC2C4949F
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0xFCC51B60
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0xAF8A61EB
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xDA449C9A
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x34EF8195
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0xC8A2387B
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xED8490BF
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0xC016146E
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xD2587C0B
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0xF8956856
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0xCBF8B501
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x351752BD
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xDB59D4F2
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0xA49EFCE8

0xC2C4949F
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0xD95E367C
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x80C36D97
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x70CBF474
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xBDC73651
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x380E825E
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x6D1DA1AB
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0xACA128AA

0xC2C4949F
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0x7CB06224
off," replied the magistrate.
0x60E32B74

0xC2C4949F
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0x676BA33D
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x3850FB51
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x3C0984CE
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0xC3E2B841
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0x12114B2E
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xA5DE28B4
see her?"
0x7CBF1A30

0xC2C4949F
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x0A899224
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x1434EA0F

0xC2C4949F
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x2E054544
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x7EAC3A2E
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x156592D4
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x62C5BEFF

0xC2C4949F
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x4D11FFA3

0xC2C4949F
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x615235C4
must and will do it."
0x11201DD1

0xC2C4949F
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x6F8BF3C4

0xC2C4949F
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0xF5011C94

0xC2C4949F
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xE6AEFE15
in, of course."
0xD69DEBB9

0xC2C4949F
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0xC62AD96C
throw away such a chance of fun."
0xA674627B

0xC2C4949F
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x5C42F46C

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0xD177A17D
in the Dowager Ingram.
0x727DD034

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x73198E80
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x2A5F38C4
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0xCFD69E1D
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x11C653C1
forward."
0x9D9AA42A

0xC2C4949F
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0xE45CDE27

0xC2C4949F
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x10690A20
Sam!"
0x78F12C98

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x3B0E52DB
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x55C2216A

0xC2C4949F
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x76D13EBA

0xC2C4949F
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x259D37CB

0xC2C4949F
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0xCA370CAF
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xD61E713D

0xC2C4949F
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x69B2F7E3
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x3531D64E
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x5AEF1150
one."
0x35EFE1B6

0xC2C4949F
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x43366FEC
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0xBB8A98C6

0xC2C4949F
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x49E2BB26
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x0630B6B5
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0xD139E626

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0x7ED6E337

0xC2C4949F
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x97CB0AEF

0xC2C4949F
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x45ED492E
once more.
0xE1231A5F

0xC2C4949F
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x87FCB044
know who will be her first visitor."
0xBE3E0154

0xC2C4949F
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x7B574FEE
said Colonel Dent.
0x120BD1CC

0xC2C4949F
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0xEE2A50DA

0xC2C4949F
Sam went and returned.
0xDA7B5CA1

0xC2C4949F
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x98BB88ED
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x540F3257
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x05574C02

0xC2C4949F
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0xDF117472

0xC2C4949F
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0x14F29CDC
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x399D0845
of his men.
0x56AA63A4

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xBD9D06F8
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x2B4EA784
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x96550D93

0xC2C4949F
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xAE3808F6
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x45EF2A19
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x0A4C18FA
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x11F9E891

0xC2C4949F
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0xE4B99089
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0xB00BA6C8

0xC2C4949F
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x35864927
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xFAF07A0D
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x6240504B
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x12A0EA9B

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x16F0A0A3

0xC2C4949F
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0xB347BDC8

0xC2C4949F
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0xE8753773
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xF5D5A2D4

0xC2C4949F
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0x0878F9A1
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x5AABC8E9
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xDB51178F
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0x01CCEDE8
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x31D60838
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x68F3CE33
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0xB470F583
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0x0F2C05FA
morning, as he threatened."
0x5FF32A4A

0xC2C4949F
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x204504E1
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x67472F20
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x97EB19BB
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x66C4C4F1
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x5CB0EB9E
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x62DCD178
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x9CAB231B
whatever revelations had been made her.
0x5BB3FEA5

0xC2C4949F
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x483999DF

0xC2C4949F
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0xC371ACC0
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xC3CA06B8
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x60B9642F
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0xA57517C2
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0xB1F3E718
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x241C1EF1

0xC2C4949F
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xFF3693DD
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xD710B6AD
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xC763929F
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x82EDD0FC

0xC2C4949F
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xCDE91C46
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x50A7B794
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x794DBFCE

0xC2C4949F
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xA2F9639F
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x1A7B40D7
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x889CCBB7
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0xDEF66E69
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x102587AA
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x9289A920
they most wished for.
0xFE414080

0xC2C4949F
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0xC8B67A0E
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x53A4B6D7
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x00F2CABE
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xE4184AEB
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0xEE8D3C7F
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xFB9B6B4B
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x00E2DD81

0xC2C4949F
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0xE8C37FA5
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x6477A5F2
saw Sam.
0x1423340E

0xC2C4949F
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x009754DC
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0x2268DE65
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0xF7DDBB6C
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xD3145D7A

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0x4B9C63C6
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0xE914A9A9
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0xB31F729F
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0x695C06F8
quietly behind me.
0xE96D5F80

0xC2C4949F
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0xDF7B4E05
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x4950CBE3

0xC2C4949F
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x1F52CA22
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x5CAE4796

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XIX
0x18E947DA

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x6F0A3B32
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0xAF4E85A5
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0x97B37A1E
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x6B85278F
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0x91F20615
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0xA4B93A35
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0x2DBEB180
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0x43E6217E
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0xBEE8D6D5

0xC2C4949F
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0xC9839057
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x9BB2FDEF
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0xBAC9F561
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x0E54C3DB
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x8AE026D1
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x7B695C80
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0xA11ACFAC
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0x6DC3E06A
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xC160B33B

0xC2C4949F
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x3A974409
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0x9DCB3695

0xC2C4949F
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0x32247394
warn you, I have no faith."
0xC3DF090D

0xC2C4949F
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0xB35DEF7D
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0xA0BD7400

0xC2C4949F
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0xF802C06F

0xC2C4949F
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x2F66090E

0xC2C4949F
"You need them all in your trade."
0xE2E622F6

0xC2C4949F
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0xCCA4DB16
you tremble?"
0xFE663B37

0xC2C4949F
"I'm not cold."
0x706E82C5

0xC2C4949F
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0x1F9DB947

0xC2C4949F
"I am not sick."
0xE712E6AA

0xC2C4949F
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0x265EB25B

0xC2C4949F
"I'm not silly."
0x7E1209C3

0xC2C4949F
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x3FDA37FB
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x175C981C
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x6C4E3442
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x303C2059
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x11205AB8

0xC2C4949F
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0x66ED75EF

0xC2C4949F
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x7A5B9075
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x7C4F2E73
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x01DE2270
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x8F5B8B8F
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0xFB470F51
you."
0x7B4FD10F

0xC2C4949F
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x421A0AB8
with vigour.
0x76DAB560

0xC2C4949F
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0x2245028D
solitary dependent in a great house."
0x2D901B73

0xC2C4949F
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0x0751E331
one?"
0x886B99B7

0xC2C4949F
"In my circumstances."
0x0A121060

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x4C04337B
placed as you are."
0x6E771B96

0xC2C4949F
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0xBBC761D3

0xC2C4949F
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0x97DB2EE2
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x9AC4D1B8
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0x59255BDE
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0x1B1532AB

0xC2C4949F
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0x6BB0B36C

0xC2C4949F
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0x2EF5CA84

0xC2C4949F
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0xC73FBBE6

0xC2C4949F
"To be sure."
0x5BA2F26E

0xC2C4949F
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0xA5949D4B
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xD6330C3E
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0x02D57ECF
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0xCF5D3608

0xC2C4949F
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xA7A1A250
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x06E02F9D
there."
0x1D9A4C18

0xC2C4949F
"I believe you," said I.
0x4EB91B4E

0xC2C4949F
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x2E5C4908
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0xD29F176A

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x8BC30F82
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xFC41349B

0xC2C4949F
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x476A202F
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0xDCE32599
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x68117F75

0xC2C4949F
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x044CD36A
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0xE96B2A27
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0xAE8CE4F1
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x837B5631
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0xA2572163
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0xC024434C

0xC2C4949F
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0xC6BEC8C6

0xC2C4949F
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xC675AEA4
whispers of the future?"
0x865AE3ED

0xC2C4949F
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x68228F41
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0xC6E1BFEA

0xC2C4949F
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0x3AB17F3B
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x87CBF2BA

0xC2C4949F
"You have learned them from the servants."
0xEB6E025A

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0xAC7AAC3D
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x5CDBD7AE

0xC2C4949F
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0x36B36FF1

0xC2C4949F
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0xCDB9E906
after all, then!"
0x238A057C

0xC2C4949F
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0x77F3AFC0
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0x93CFBD1E
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x88A4A377
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0x2A0ED864
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0x85DFFB0D
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0x5AF9E1AC

0xC2C4949F
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x20354745

0xC2C4949F
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0xC3BC2C3F

0xC2C4949F
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0x38D00C0B
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0x2FD65EDD

0xC2C4949F
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0x9D641AB0

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0x35BD3C79
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0xD97BC95C

0xC2C4949F
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0x962C8A9C

0xC2C4949F
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0x790F6090

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x72DA257E
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0xC6BE5911
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0x316CF69C

0xC2C4949F
"I what?"
0xB7FEEF39

0xC2C4949F
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0x7317517D

0xC2C4949F
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x7FC67224
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x30A27041
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0x6E0FAC06
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x73DB6736
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0x0851A110
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0x9928FDFA

0xC2C4949F
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0x899E1E42
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0xE6A6ED55

0xC2C4949F
"He is not at home."
0x28DEF3F6

0xC2C4949F
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0x7E6EC11E
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x990F2994
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x247FF7C6
it were, out of existence?"
0x993A234F

0xC2C4949F
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0xFABE7F70
you had introduced."
0x838135DE

0xC2C4949F
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0xC48E16DE
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0xD56876D2
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0x3AFD36FA

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0xBFF3875D

0xC2C4949F
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0xAD0B869A
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0x1C91E180
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0x78594253

0xC2C4949F
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0xBF8B73E9
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0x07407F54
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0x11BE6598
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x7F17FE63
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0xABE9E7B3
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0x3E589812

0xC2C4949F
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0x0C282B6C
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0x495151AC
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0x4C6E6418
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0xB47ECE75
noticed this?"
0x3C2F558C

0xC2C4949F
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x62AE94DE

0xC2C4949F
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0x3FF671D2
gratitude?"
0x9D768D24

0xC2C4949F
I said nothing.
0xA7D3B452

0xC2C4949F
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0xF3FB5220
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0xCC5ED393

0xC2C4949F
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0x2DD08FA5

0xC2C4949F
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0xF9C4B831

0xC2C4949F
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0x4A8A863B
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0xB5239A77

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x74479FA8

0xC2C4949F
"Shortly?"
0x1BD923AD

0xC2C4949F
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0xE2D3C779
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0xC682A142
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0x81E1A179
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x517DBF3D
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0x0C0B6177
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0xB9018FB2
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0xD930DF04
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0x83126B27
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0x1C646247
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0x8C2D7C1F

0xC2C4949F
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0x1CD0AA86
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0x7657ADDE

0xC2C4949F
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0x899DE57D
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0xEF9B44D8
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0xE6FF2FAB
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x2D6317E3
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0x9BBA7188
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0xC6CEB035

0xC2C4949F
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0xD4A3C768

0xC2C4949F
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0xA2ADFB17
p190.jpg}
0xA9D6F8B4

0xC2C4949F
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0xF98653C4
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0xF1561E1D

0xC2C4949F
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0xF698A6B6
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0x91F702FB
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0x783DA5DC
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0x188EBB98
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x8A914E31
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0x5D98D002
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0xE2D4242F
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0x358E83E4
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xAA12E9FF

0xC2C4949F
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0xC5B9D23B
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0xB5F7522B
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0x08A3FD16
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0x6206CC20
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0x92BD9C63
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0x2BB73CB3

0xC2C4949F
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0x2DEC3BAE
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0xE478BF6B
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0xA1039329
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0x82C070BB
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0xE1CCF345
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0xCB9CB204
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0xF2056340
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0x12DA99D8
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x24D78320
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0x7273CF54
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0xB7A0806A
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x0036BCBE
dictates of conscience.'
0xE44528DE

0xC2C4949F
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x7B575C20
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0x5E77A215
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0x84307278
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0xCB4B1AB5
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0x22F77F3A
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0x371AEA6F
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0x524B1158
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x3BA4E3EC
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0x8D2362C2
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0x1FFD2DB0
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0xF05AAFA3
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0x3848A432
me; the play is played out'."
0x535481C8

0xC2C4949F
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x6BA6F3B6
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0x0B95949A
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0xAC4644AF
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x4A349BA8
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0x4AF224FB
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0xC35FEC7C
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x38B7FABC
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x184570F1
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0xEDBCAF04
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0xA81B8C99
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0x0B553AA7
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x3978FD87
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0x25D414F3

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x2F0EBB4F

0xC2C4949F
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0xCF4CE338

0xC2C4949F
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x72E6EE6F

0xC2C4949F
"Break it, sir."
0x75DA8730

0xC2C4949F
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x9F99950F
disguise.
0x30BF740D

0xC2C4949F
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0x5CBE725D

0xC2C4949F
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0x9CC00579

0xC2C4949F
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x9192BD84

0xC2C4949F
"But not with you?"
0xCDBE0B46

0xC2C4949F
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0xAF072700

0xC2C4949F
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0x80B4E96D

0xC2C4949F
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0xE7E3D319
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0xA38E83FE
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x3774DD48

0xC2C4949F
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0xFEE7D734

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x4D36F74C
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x68B3612F
but it was not right."
0x5605E6D2

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0x7696434C

0xC2C4949F
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0xAFA66B39
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x4391C467
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0xA300F9D2
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0x2B4B4276
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x1EEDCB95
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xA7BD5EFC
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xEF8E7953
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x67066E25

0xC2C4949F
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x4398A844
signify?"
0xD80A0512

0xC2C4949F
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0xCB1E5426
now, I suppose?"
0xB271E3F9

0xC2C4949F
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0xBF2D0641
yonder are doing."
0x973F3CF1

0xC2C4949F
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0x9334251E

0xC2C4949F
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0xC5F1A956

0xC2C4949F
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0xA4204C38
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0xA5D95211
left this morning?"
0xBFC1EEB4

0xC2C4949F
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0xEF36F452

0xC2C4949F
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x9F3716A4
installing himself here till you returned."
0x355316E1

0xC2C4949F
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x6B39AA2E

0xC2C4949F
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x8A04719F
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x20469526

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x93B48571
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0xBE5D0873
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0xFD03A501

0xC2C4949F
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x6D314983
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0xE4D39F65
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x04E57327
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x6F2EB959
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x4AC80DAE

0xC2C4949F
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xC15EB7A7

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0xC1D8FBFB

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x3254AB7A

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0xD6D89D42

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0x6B0D1790

0xC2C4949F
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x16514C02
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0x0D23D590
and dreary look.
0x1541728F

0xC2C4949F
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0x4D0B0117
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x44EDF8BC

0xC2C4949F
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x28779B14

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0xB5089129

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x88A32BC5

0xC2C4949F
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x50992209
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0xCD66363A
doing."
0x51AA0CA6

0xC2C4949F
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0xD952E732
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0xE882E1AB
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x1A8B8D1C
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x4996B2F6
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xB1D9FB09
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0xF0B9209D
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0x3F4E42FA
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0x29FCDECB
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x83195FCC

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x68006785
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0xBB166907

0xC2C4949F
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x7DE1FD8D
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x1AA52A8A

0xC2C4949F
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0x8CCBBC8C

0xC2C4949F
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0xFE2B5BB4
strange?"
0xE83F7D44

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x371F8507

0xC2C4949F
"And Mason?"
0x500DD34A

0xC2C4949F
"He was laughing too."
0x4C8A0B9E

0xC2C4949F
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xF2E5A548
Jane?"
0x7C390F10

0xC2C4949F
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x08BE170D

0xC2C4949F
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x093D4FAD
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x6AD9A14C
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0xFC3B15B2

0xC2C4949F
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x912351E7
you."
0x7B4FD10F

0xC2C4949F
"To comfort me?"
0x7B8D06AD

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0xB7B7D4F3

0xC2C4949F
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x0103A04A

0xC2C4949F
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0xC356771F
care nothing about it."
0x23BD55CB

0xC2C4949F
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x17B71AA6

0xC2C4949F
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0xAD49747E
you, I am sure, do."
0x529160AE

0xC2C4949F
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0xBE11F0AB
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x0295FCB5
and then leave me."
0x28EE4D89

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0x92258E57
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x62810684
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x1EFA6E94

0xC2C4949F
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x638408F9
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x8EC603FE
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x891CC412

0xC2C4949F
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0xDEA4CAD8
asleep.
0x8A03191F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XX
0xCFC6BED3

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0x997A4162
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x1F299C76
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xE2775D36
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x48FC9F66
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x7B115D30
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0xD2B8D0B3
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0x12AB830C
the curtain.
0xCF59C1A8

0xC2C4949F
Good God!  What a cry!
0x8075DFDB

0xC2C4949F
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x9E36401E
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x52136C8F

0xC2C4949F
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0x9C8AE79A
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x45AD95F9
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x3678C1D6
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0x9E04ADA5
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0xCD00D0FA
it could repeat the effort.
0x53DDFCCF

0xC2C4949F
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xC530AEF1
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x96D60DEA
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0xB063B2AF
voice shouted--
0x840767FD

0xC2C4949F
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x91C96CDE

0xC2C4949F
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x8165E933
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0xD3FD574B

0xC2C4949F
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xD2C2C0C7

0xC2C4949F
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0x2D347F20
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0xFF9CA9BE
was silence.
0xBAB343E8

0xC2C4949F
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0x9DEA66E9
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x8C8AF89F
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x1FF703D5
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x1C411296
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x93BFA05F
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x8972B8E6
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x3FE89159
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x198A5074
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x6E79023A
confusion was inextricable.
0xC1D701B4

0xC2C4949F
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0xE6865C33
in his bed."
0x9B73E663

0xC2C4949F
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xAAF44574
coming."
0x27F1B9A5

0xC2C4949F
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x9DA9090F
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0x061DEF70
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x38BA5542

0xC2C4949F
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x7C29B6D5
worst at once!"
0x937FB229

0xC2C4949F
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x654A4870
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0x8454A986
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0x791AF024

0xC2C4949F
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x9A53416E
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0xFE6B2CFC

0xC2C4949F
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0x279A1093
by an effort, he added--
0x81FCE1D0

0xC2C4949F
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x41C666B4
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x377B9A51
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0xC94BDD39
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0xDD16B835
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0xCAF9BDEC
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x3D1DF8E3
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x7AE07417
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0xD0E975E2
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x8A9FFFE3

0xC2C4949F
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x403AF7DB
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x9F6CD929
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0xA647064B
had left it.
0x3A820721

0xC2C4949F
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x5102EAE6
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x18B0E021
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0xD8BE42B4
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0xC7DA4CDD
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xBECAA4CE
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0x8BC5ED2A
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0xA2DE7207
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x96DB85F4
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x95A51D68
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x271D30E4

0xC2C4949F
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x4EE03516
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x8E81CFEB
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0xD600277B
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x280B528C
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x9114F19F
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x2C8B3F49
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x341592B0

0xC2C4949F
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x969E0F22

0xC2C4949F
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0xCBC7BB22

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And dressed?"
0x2ECEC68D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x610D9428

0xC2C4949F
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x1C1E6557

0xC2C4949F
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x1B40AF9B
noise."
0xADB82CFF

0xC2C4949F
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x18FB15D5
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0xE495063C
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x87546124
side.
0x958AF60F

0xC2C4949F
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0x06D0EFBB

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x0B52E51C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Go back and fetch both."
0xAEAC58EE

0xC2C4949F
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0x9071F5DB
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0xF00FFF0A
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0xAE1A29D5
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xA562F9F6

0xC2C4949F
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x81015B54

0xC2C4949F
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0xFF5ACF98

0xC2C4949F
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x6788A0F5

0xC2C4949F
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0xB0144F3D
fit."
0xB7728EB2

0xC2C4949F
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x1F79CFE1
the key and opened the door.
0x3A1F1F00

0xC2C4949F
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0xB6D1761C
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0xF5A5192A
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x069B7B1A
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x8AA1F0A9
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x227696EA
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0xEA48FF7C
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x645C6450
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x09A44D66
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0xAFFE3E10
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x18F0828C
came out and closed the door behind him.
0xB1250067

0xC2C4949F
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x52524987
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x7236D9BC
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x266D149B
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x858C705E
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0xD6ABB7F1
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0x6787F64E
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x8A7333DF
blood.
0xE0080DE2

0xC2C4949F
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x8DC00ADA
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x69406C5A
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xCC6E2898
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0x490004F3
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x58D93FC3
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xDB7072D2
blood, trickling fast down.
0x5701DC6A

0xC2C4949F
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x7CE5B4A2

0xC2C4949F
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xABE1B686
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0x9072495E
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xCB4B1292

0xC2C4949F
"Sir?"
0x522CD5EA

0xC2C4949F
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0xED43DE50
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x0551500E
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x349734A5
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0x831E4026
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x309267E5
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x77A39610
consequences."
0x61039A94

0xC2C4949F
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x01D5FE1A
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0x28003D0A
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0xEA042BDC
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x179809FE
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x0F990675
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0xC4EB24F6
step ceased to be heard.
0x94DF4BA9

0xC2C4949F
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xF7F2152D
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x97CEA55E
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x0A7D0DC2
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x4139CB68
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x8F52133D

0xC2C4949F
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x489BF053
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0xE456916E
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xB342B7A0
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x1CA0C682
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0xA392CEA5
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xBEB22AF0
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x885D720C
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0x698E1DB2
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x9B425E9A
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x2C50E834
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0xD5236DE5
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x705FEC7F

0xC2C4949F
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x7B2BA34E
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0xF23896FF
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x3068B6C7
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0x7650FBEF
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0xADCF3483
subordinate's form.
0x15B37A62

0xC2C4949F
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0xCCCFF854
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x1A9670E3
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0xE4232088
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0xABACFF57
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0xD54AEE9D

0xC2C4949F
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x3936E71B
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0xD7728B2E
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x2C3312E3
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x28237394
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x8F4583C0
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xF1F69E09

0xC2C4949F
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xB65E4357
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x88E6F747
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0xF9302EE1
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x333B0C40
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0xDD3FE336
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xCEB7F4B6
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0x9F1DD7F7
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x3A84A9C9
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x51E6CCE8
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0x71C460AF
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x5F906AC4
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x696E5A1C
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0xE4FA30AE
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x2517302D
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0xB8D979B2
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x1981C350
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x1CE8789D
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0xA2F72BDE
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0xC4720ABF

0xC2C4949F
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x0E3F9AE9
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x5C7839B1
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x589EE381
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0xD9B45FC6
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0xA3EB9E4A

0xC2C4949F
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0x5BB2EB3F
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x16D34D4C
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x8B4E2D66
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0xDB12CCCA
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xC4DDA9E5
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x455EE7D8
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xB719AA8C
I might not even speak to him.
0x3C764E2F

0xC2C4949F
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x77A2FCF7
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xA249BB4C
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x43DFE65B
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x7A041CF9
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xF0EEFFDD
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x21F7CC7C
shorter.
0x776217A6

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0xD91E819E

0xC2C4949F
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0xA5C820C9
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x0AC56FD6
patient downstairs and all."
0xFF82F16D

0xC2C4949F
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0xB8B8DB2F

0xC2C4949F
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x41FC8A9E
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0xB4D173AD

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x5C933467
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0xD81FC124
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x1328854F
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0xC93548C3

0xC2C4949F
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x58EFD348

0xC2C4949F
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xDF138A56

0xC2C4949F
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0xAB5E9800
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0xFAA54FFF
there's no danger."
0x57377BE3

0xC2C4949F
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x68995B3B
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xF7D84607
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x84B55E71
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x22E1F923
here!"
0xC282A1FE

0xC2C4949F
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x79A105AC
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x907B6647

0xC2C4949F
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x0B0791BC
said Mr. Rochester.
0xDE2F9B15

0xC2C4949F
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x58C108AA
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0x2E466D09
looked so quiet at first."
0xF62216D2

0xC2C4949F
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x88356C95
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x1F6E2291
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x5B6DDCBA
alone."
0xBF08EAEB

0xC2C4949F
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xEBC51616

0xC2C4949F
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x08802856
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0xCD65EAB3
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0xD6FF5069
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xD3F68CD5

0xC2C4949F
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x3365DBB6
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x62576DC0

0xC2C4949F
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x39F75749

0xC2C4949F
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x79058313
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x91E6B624
said--
0xD489085A

0xC2C4949F
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x9A03D84C
it."
0x5BC07045

0xC2C4949F
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x12FBBE64

0xC2C4949F
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0xB5E23B66
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0x9DCC1F8A
think of her at all."
0x2F41B397

0xC2C4949F
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xC34D298A

0xC2C4949F
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xD415846D
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0xC1FCC764
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x900813B5
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xB2EE0F8E
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0xA2FA9D7A
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x094137FF
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0xCD32AC8F

0xC2C4949F
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0xEED7A10A
and returned with them.
0xC3384B19

0xC2C4949F
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0x780B0D0C
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0x621C991E

0xC2C4949F
I retired as directed.
0x2F8A22E7

0xC2C4949F
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x768F3C1B
Rochester presently.
0x70B36022

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x1DA8FD53

0xC2C4949F
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0xA6BE71E9
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x36191284
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x6A237FE5
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xE178F092
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x51CDE933
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xA8C1AAA6
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0xD70E4EB3

0xC2C4949F
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x2834C690
edged with fur.
0x15F33A40

0xC2C4949F
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xCD8B81EE
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0xACA91EB1
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xBD4116BE
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0xAC63A84E
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xD14C2C99

0xC2C4949F
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x28E01079

0xC2C4949F
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x1D86115B
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x41982AA0
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0xCAAE42FD
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0x7EF84811
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xCBA5B2F4

0xC2C4949F
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0xCB60296A
the washstand.
0x05E671F4

0xC2C4949F
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0xEA2A13AE

0xC2C4949F
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x699C3462
to Mason.
0x49098E74

0xC2C4949F
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0xE4D22DAA

0xC2C4949F
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0xA95451FE

0xC2C4949F
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x5260CDBC

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xE0D12082
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x99F0B20A
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0x8D6AA3AB
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x850BA90F

0xC2C4949F
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0xD49F4C50

0xC2C4949F
The patient rose.
0x9CDB6953

0xC2C4949F
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x7B69B4C2
step out--that's it!"
0xDFD05977

0xC2C4949F
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x8ED3046A

0xC2C4949F
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0x5ADDF196
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x43884837
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x61FBD7AF
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x15C84C76
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x873E9C71

0xC2C4949F
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0xC70593C7
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x1F9C3E91
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x0E79C68A
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x8D086D1C
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x316C226C
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0x4DC2D707
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0xFA9A807E
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x659F9EE5
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0xE09791A6
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x39D5CE15
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x99C70D8D
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x42C0EEB5

0xC2C4949F
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0xC7FA6BC1
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0x6FFBEB20
chaise; Carter followed.
0xA69C6400

0xC2C4949F
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0xF5D335F6
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x4DA5FD6D
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x07418ADA

0xC2C4949F
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0x69922713

0xC2C4949F
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x77D736F1
Dick."
0x40201E62

0xC2C4949F
"Fairfax--"
0x43166DC9

0xC2C4949F
"Well what is it?"
0xF580270F

0xC2C4949F
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x432B0EDF
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0x54961094

0xC2C4949F
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x6D2CDDA3
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x5598CFE3

0xC2C4949F
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x5BE8F864
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0xDD58B141

0xC2C4949F
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0x7FF86035
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x6C0F7017
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0x97C021B5
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x83B5D4C6

0xC2C4949F
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x2198C9A5
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x9CE58642

0xC2C4949F
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0xCBCBDABD

0xC2C4949F
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0xB706A0FD
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0x31313F58
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x158DA39E
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0x2B193A59
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x4DF878CE
pure."
0x43DD0D84

0xC2C4949F
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x80A14E8F
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x82C9BC83
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x57A8D1DF
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x2B664799
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x7CE922A1
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x56283FF7
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x5923E758
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0xD00FEFE7

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0xDE133EE7

0xC2C4949F
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0xAACED543
me.
0x8830A70E

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you, sir."
0xAF8BDF2E

0xC2C4949F
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x5F995EB5
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x2B4BF206
atmosphere?"
0xED0071BC

0xC2C4949F
"I do, very much."
0x93803DFB

0xC2C4949F
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0xA2B5977C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0xDB9D812E
with Mason?"
0x263A937A

0xC2C4949F
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x050B8023

0xC2C4949F
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x01F02DF1
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x10EA082A
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0xC843135D

0xC2C4949F
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x2B1BE421

0xC2C4949F
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0xB9FA92E1
thoughts."
0x87DC50F1

0xC2C4949F
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0xF23FFE4C

0xC2C4949F
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0xB4D9E624

0xC2C4949F
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0xE950DFBE

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xB7BD154F
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x99264909
spue fire any day."
0x44747B02

0xC2C4949F
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0xD501B8FC
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0x61DD6568
you."
0x7B4FD10F

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0xDF394F02
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0xF5B9B3DC
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0xB0E17D37

0xC2C4949F
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x196E3F40
how to avert the danger."
0x2933244F

0xC2C4949F
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x48E14F9B
from him.
0x53860FD1

0xC2C4949F
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0xA7E504ED
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0x084BA9E2
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xC427B6E7
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0xE72614BC
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x6AFB183F
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0xFDB19B3C
friend, are you not?"
0x93E14ABB

0xC2C4949F
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0xBFE8BFB5

0xC2C4949F
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0x30C3F375
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0xFF429BD3
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0xBA1B4593
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0xEE94841B
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x338C86EA
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x2E8CE79A
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0x0E8890B8
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0xF9B00653
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0xD2AB87FA
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x8E07849B
me at once."
0xBC69D6CF

0xC2C4949F
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x6959D9C2
you are very safe."
0x2B51925A

0xC2C4949F
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0xD89C3222

0xC2C4949F
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x4A8A8A08
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0xF18B0907
before him.
0xFF187E47

0xC2C4949F
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x737E8758
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0xA1B47F52

0xC2C4949F
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x89325B0E

0xC2C4949F
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x3E63BDBE
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0x81CC462B
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0xB336198D
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0xB0019D77
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x5482BD3D
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x5B36D4F3

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir; I am content."
0xC7D53DCB

0xC2C4949F
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xDC1A5D71
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x97A855EC
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0xA9BD2CC9
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x917777A8
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0xD6AC1FC2
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x05287518
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xFAAEFD41
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0x495978D2
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0x60B24C3D
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0xD8402854
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x39D449A7
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0xA024D612
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x6E4C2058
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x83941C6A
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x258DCF42
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x23DF77AF
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0xB6388609
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x64365C7D
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0xD10BB447
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0x69F28C75
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x18CA5502
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0xBB028DF5
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x47E8E36C
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0xA20EA9F8
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x6C753062
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x4DABAE36
judgment approves?"
0xBE160F5F

0xC2C4949F
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0xD6CD1847
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xB1EC1D1E
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x5740E9C2
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x73D95C00
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x6CA1B96D

0xC2C4949F
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0x7576DB84

0xC2C4949F
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x9E5D665F
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x7CC5A8F4
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0xA5C6CD5E
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0x7AE26515

0xC2C4949F
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x9F471248
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0xF0B9F83E
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x6F636507
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0xB2A17C9C
amend and solace to heal."
0x2F017567

0xC2C4949F
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0xED4CB25E
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x37E9F0E3
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x9214FE92
instrument for my cure in--"
0xF3A98DFC

0xC2C4949F
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0x605212C3
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x326A3265
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x8D988007
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0x5407BAB6
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x957E2D0F

0xC2C4949F
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x63D663E3
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0x4310FC6E
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x6F6549FE
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0x9AA11C2A

0xC2C4949F
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x8225DEB3
came back he was humming a tune.
0xFF7242F0

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x6270DC69
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x0C3DE109

0xC2C4949F
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0xC9D15096

0xC2C4949F
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x3656A95C
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xFD0FA38F
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x09627B0A

0xC2C4949F
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0xF66E5B22

0xC2C4949F
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0x34073ED2
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x0E312785
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0xCD7B9539

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x76CA52D8

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x20FE0E0C
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x5FA135F6
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0xC3A67F44

0xC2C4949F
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0xB8809959
cheerfully--
0xCE6D1065

0xC2C4949F
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0x742A4C08
I rose at four to see him off."
0xD7E6E375

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXI
0xA69ADF29

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x38EB1253
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x8F3F2F2D
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0xE9AF56D8
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0xD91F0A92
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x896713D9
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0xA2DBED4D
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x1EE90B5D
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0xBDAF8BD2
man.
0x59B0D07C

0xC2C4949F
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0x867F3F22
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x44F1C898
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x7B54D941
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0xAF250F53
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0xE3520B0A
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x31335E00
little sister.
0xBE8EEFE0

0xC2C4949F
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xDB41988F
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xEF5CFE42
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0xC6C31F96
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xEE804627
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x7B404421
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x6156BFF4
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x7AFADE4E
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x0F5F9990
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x28AF847F

0xC2C4949F
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0xB17BAD94
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x61E2420C
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x2F841EE4
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x61720DB0
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0xEB2A3A96
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xE1FD2D74
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0xD40C4DCF
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x17B496AC
was surrounded with a crape band.
0xB9CF90B1

0xC2C4949F
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xA20873C6
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0xD8C27807
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0xA295986A

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x86AECD14
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0xBDD518EB
are married to Bessie?"
0x34E552BB

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0x0303E897
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x0CD5127A
child are thriving."
0xC7F7BA36

0xC2C4949F
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0x8E0991CB

0xC2C4949F
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x5755FFDC
badly at present--in great trouble."
0x3397688E

0xC2C4949F
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x707CD4A8
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0xAB91B36D

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xFEF2990F

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. John?"
0xFCEB2C96

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x37A93A48

0xC2C4949F
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x25612A21
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x29EB53EE
his death was shocking."
0x6D7E5223

0xC2C4949F
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0xFD1DA8F9

0xC2C4949F
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x7939FD30
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x746711D9
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0xD5F072CB
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x6FA5DBB2
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x5719C812
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0xE1ABDCA5
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0xB14F9A20
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x02FF94CD
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x7D118297

0xC2C4949F
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x70129408

0xC2C4949F
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0xA54F38A8
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x18FBD9B0
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x57BD7C9D
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x56854ED3
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x0050DC79
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0xA88E94C1
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x5BF84494
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0x01E822E3
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x207DAB85
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x7987C17D
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x866B76B4
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x77DF6199
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x1742E2C4
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0x87E6CCF3
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x29613B43
morning."
0x150F1A3F

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0x68EBDDB0

0xC2C4949F
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x27C2536B
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0xD5DAC4F4

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0xA584984A
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x2F25178A
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xDF27D157

0xC2C4949F
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x9BF242E0
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0xB57768C3
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x92AC20EF
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0xCBCB9A21
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0xE38E7BAB
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x03FD1DD7
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0x87B3F1D9
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xC66CB90B
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x95D9262D
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0xFB221D6A
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0xD5407F28
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xAA596940
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0x266AC4BE
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0x2C0C557F
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xD49F53D2
lineaments.
0xFDA6B4E5

0xC2C4949F
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x4734252B
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0xDC2EFEC1
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0x14D7AB13
cue and followed me from the room.
0x4C972D67

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0x5FE9E64B
which he had shut.
0x23272648

0xC2C4949F
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0xC2989EDA

0xC2C4949F
"What to do?--where to go?"
0x18F4649A

0xC2C4949F
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0x32B3B6EB

0xC2C4949F
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x308B68EC

0xC2C4949F
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x3D5F70B2

0xC2C4949F
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0xE52E1232
people to see her that distance?"
0x0A7A4FDF

0xC2C4949F
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0x7B66479B

0xC2C4949F
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0x16AAD7BC

0xC2C4949F
"It is his widow, sir."
0x7CE7E8A2

0xC2C4949F
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x0D468349

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0x6831B303

0xC2C4949F
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x50DD7617
had no relations."
0x6C073AE9

0xC2C4949F
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x9A33D14E
off."
0x17D99628

0xC2C4949F
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0xC2C4949F
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x52B09056

0xC2C4949F
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0x29317ED1
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x676E6823
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0xBC5AB372
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0xF2B1B82C
in London."

0xC2C4949F
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0xE3852C48
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0xDA02FA25
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0x1B39398D

0xC2C4949F
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0x6E19B45B
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0x29D4AE41
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x9BE2072D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0x1B708235
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0x00BAD906

0xC2C4949F
"How long will you stay?"
0x956B60F8

0xC2C4949F
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0x0F002828

0xC2C4949F
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0xF0420DAE

0xC2C4949F
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0x33E68565

0xC2C4949F
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0x5E913525
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0x6137FE3C

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0xC4A4242E

0xC2C4949F
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x17BF1B3F

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x2061832F

0xC2C4949F
"A person to be trusted?"
0xD6F84561

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0x6C35846B

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0x7AD5CA14

0xC2C4949F
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x9BDCCD05

0xC2C4949F
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0xFED49194
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0xC7F6D6F2
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0x859240DD

0xC2C4949F
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x7F17D7E2
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0xBCBFCC44
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0x526D6E92
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0x32FEF647
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0xA06AD4A9

0xC2C4949F
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0xC4361C5D

0xC2C4949F
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0xAD381D20
if recollecting something, he said--
0xF48B6DE0

0xC2C4949F
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0x619100A3
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0xD2E470B8
plenty?"
0x2C3A8FC1

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0xDA2F93C3

0xC2C4949F
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0xF7BB7527

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0xF385D6C9
while I have the opportunity."
0xFFC46641

0xC2C4949F
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x3A5E83D8

0xC2C4949F
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0xF0F1A1FE
married?"
0x163E15EC

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; what then?"
0x6677D4F2

0xC2C4949F
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0x7CF8D95A
perceive the necessity of it."
0x344EABEF

0xC2C4949F
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0xF7FDE8BA
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0xC72525D8
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0x3BD86149
straight to--the devil?"
0x7E234686

0xC2C4949F
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0xE6C90BB2

0xC2C4949F
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0x825B6169
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0x0984C8C8

0xC2C4949F
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0xBF99D26D
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0xD7E62DF7

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0xFC7B4EDB
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0x1DD7950D

0xC2C4949F
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0xDE58ECF0
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0x69FE1373
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0xEFC9278A

0xC2C4949F
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0xE909FA58
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0x30172FA9

0xC2C4949F
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0x4485DFC5
five pounds, Jane."
0xF7974CF6

0xC2C4949F
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0xF0D97ECF

0xC2C4949F
"Just let me look at the cash."
0x5EC99375

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0x049B806C

0xC2C4949F
"Jane!"
0x860F3D06

0xC2C4949F
"Sir?"
0x522CD5EA

0xC2C4949F
"Promise me one thing."
0x16793217

0xC2C4949F
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0x7616C9E4

0xC2C4949F
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0x5D4D567B
find you one in time."
0x0C26914B

0xC2C4949F
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0x61531FB4
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0x0968C78B
it."
0x5BC07045

0xC2C4949F
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0xA4E5BFCC
then?"
0x289C9FB4

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir; early."
0xAC566BBC

0xC2C4949F
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0x32E08CB6

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0x38FD5E5A

0xC2C4949F
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0xFC3E7A86

0xC2C4949F
"I suppose so, sir."
0x482287FF

0xC2C4949F
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0x2172276E
not quite up to it."
0x4594F180

0xC2C4949F
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0xC039D4E9

0xC2C4949F
"Then say it."
0x4C4F8533

0xC2C4949F
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x5B539BB2

0xC2C4949F
"What must I say?"
0x58EDA992

0xC2C4949F
"The same, if you like, sir."
0x65355634

0xC2C4949F
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0x3E6F4054

0xC2C4949F
"Yes?"
0x9E36A3B1

0xC2C4949F
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0xE4B1A581
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x4E43D292
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0x9938B26F
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0x3B46213E

0xC2C4949F
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0x531CBCF3
as in many."
0xD37F20FC

0xC2C4949F
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0x8F96C9BA

0xC2C4949F
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x0B6C568E
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xC9A6A9A9
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x2AE0A044
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x8976B017

0xC2C4949F
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0x862E46EC
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x7BAF93C7
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0x46EEFB5B
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xDEAB5871
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xC916E0BF
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x6E4DCEFA

0xC2C4949F
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0xD41489D5

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0xDFD312C3
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x9E5BA095

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0x29952645
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x207A7ECF
will finally recover."
0x02396E83

0xC2C4949F
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0xEA35AF0D

0xC2C4949F
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x0CDEEBCA
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0xCE978B85
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0x7D8B24B0
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0x65356E7A
and then I will go up with you?"
0x102867BE

0xC2C4949F
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x8F8182DF
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0x6E165636
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x6DD9FFAB
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0x41B36092
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x8A3721C3

0xC2C4949F
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0x997E02C2
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x7AA7FAB3
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0xE5F0AED6
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x412409A5
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0x97DAD744
looks.
0x4CF6B310

0xC2C4949F
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x351A4611
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x1228E2C1
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x03CFB4D0
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0x0DD9CF25
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x1DF61321
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x98FCC946

0xC2C4949F
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0x2646CCE5
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x69A745D5
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x9EF3BF81
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x08E83D02
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0xAC4557FD
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x055FEA58
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x7BE70DFF

0xC2C4949F
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0xDB7BFEF9
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x4DBF7BDF
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x81DECC26
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x4ECA419D
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x14625986
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0xA83124BE
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0xD5796D8E
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x5FC5CD8B
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0xFAFA9181
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x67B838D3
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0x63ECCBD2
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0x41218A30

0xC2C4949F
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x84ECB1CE
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0xA8FE961B

0xC2C4949F
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x32F86504
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xDCF598BF
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x89CB5980
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0xF5096360
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x241797FC
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x60ECAD22
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x7DAEBACC
past recognition.
0xD4679B6F

0xC2C4949F
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xE96140ED
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x4B31F7C1
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xF70A0831
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x75222C6B
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0xEF082EDF
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xAE80342A
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x117812CD
colourless visage.
0x3D27FE80

0xC2C4949F
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0xD4AB2802
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x18F24F83
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0xED198288
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0xF48D9BA9
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0xF9FB9224
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x4F9A236C
other's looked puritanical.
0x0DFCF25C

0xC2C4949F
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0x37AAF8BE
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xEA32B5FC
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0x938F3685
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0xDE898A64
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x21B3990D

0xC2C4949F
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x5841C25D
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x3F13E1C8
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x26106ACA
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xB72A496B
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x23906866
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x54728FF1
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xCE5B2B97
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x1650F7B9
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xBC67A133
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x8233E7C5
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xDCC09CE6
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0x9E6E83E4
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0x48E4E5BE

0xC2C4949F
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x2647AF74
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0xF9F83E55
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x36E3C138
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x2D90A4EB
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0xFB0442F8
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x32068A87
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x277BFA8C
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0xBF00AD98
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x3AF91E45

0xC2C4949F
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x6EFE5020
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0xA5EBD5BA
liberty.
0xDFF67C70

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x320095A9
can see her to-night."
0xEDF42331

0xC2C4949F
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0xB49AE49E
should be much obliged to you."
0x9B5FD485

0xC2C4949F
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x2A592CCB
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x397C2859
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x4C20BBB9

0xC2C4949F
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xEDC764CA
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x46F7C34D
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0x163CE4AE
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x1F3CC892
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0xB20D218F
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x52E544C3
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0xE19A4DF9
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x29C10395
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x2D612006
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x142EAFBA
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0xD5BB7467
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x2ADC8ACF
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x9DE10F03
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0xBFF4AE77
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x4C7183E7

0xC2C4949F
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0xC30F32CA
us see if she will know you."
0x2655E12E

0xC2C4949F
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0x6CEB1850
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x2179FF5A
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x66F7F514
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0xF7701D7B
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x66232B5E
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0xB071A7C1
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0xED6AAB44
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x948A59C9
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x43FE865D
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x2C608233
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0x81954092

0xC2C4949F
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0xF7909EBC
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0xC75C2C3A
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xFA1186DC
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x5C7E3F8C
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x89EBE6FE
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0xB696D0B6
amity.
0x2A3E6E9B

0xC2C4949F
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x065756EA
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x9BD5C557
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0xDC0845F0
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0xF7256E25
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0xAF659930
she looked at me.
0xAE296CE6

0xC2C4949F
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x97D3C6C5

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0x9C7F7692

0xC2C4949F
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x0E8443F8
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xFF8B4E0E
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0xFC0A9173
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x2082D3BA
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0xFD3A3131
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0xA8F7016F
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x36A8DB02
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x2DCC5FA2
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x6B7E0BBE
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0x6D855805
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x380B72B6
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0x489778DD

0xC2C4949F
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xC14CFE54
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x78818FEF
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x0EB28370
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x18D40CAA
the pillow.
0x3718C1A8

0xC2C4949F
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0x3743E1EC
till I see how you get on."
0xFB1F7AEF

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0xC3C68A76

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xA54AAB11
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0xBDA97454
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x87F8E22D
say--let me see--"
0xDE89143E

0xC2C4949F
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0xA61256E7
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x0D857F77
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0xAC975F29
was at once irritated.
0xF1D44C93

0xC2C4949F
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x11C73F40
you Jane Eyre?"
0x6549B33B

0xC2C4949F
"I am Jane Eyre."
0xFBCAA0D3

0xC2C4949F
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0xC0A95232
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x25028DCA
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0xD3B70626
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0x1C05E906
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x830BA577
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x1AE3E359
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x4B80B087
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x8C2B0D3E
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x1301BBA1

0xC2C4949F
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0xB9420A2D

0xC2C4949F
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0xD9D5C2C1
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0xD510E1B4
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0xF49EEDF6
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x14327ACC
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x14C8BA27
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x0D29D806
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x96F4B7C1
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x905FED8A
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x635A896B
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x91D35BE9
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x4A302507
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x8066834E
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x55E6334A
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x7BC772D7
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0xBD9FB565
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xF22143A7
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xC6E1F206
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xCC415C3C
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0x572C6AA6
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x8E85F5BF
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0xC91EB091
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x6D82DE90
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xAA101D85
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x190D44A4

0xC2C4949F
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x53954013
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x6CC87CF1

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0xED4DA4CC
the morning she is calmer."
0xC8D3B56A

0xC2C4949F
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xC51C2D60
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0xCECF724A
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x75722EB6
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x206A3F70
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x77F53CFC
had?"
0x43C25453

0xC2C4949F
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x4F4C9BE7
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x99FB7FDE
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0xDF8B2B65

0xC2C4949F
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0x4168E880
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0xC16095C2
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x6A17D4EB
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x43A6E7F1
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0x51B8B95D
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xDCBBA944
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x8E064395
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x03D87298
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0x29F32240
for both.
0x4433097E

0xC2C4949F
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0xB0759FB3
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x9B280BAF
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x3297552C
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0xEC3F1EA6
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0xF392B429
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x224D63E1
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x9A3F7FB7
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0xD7F3E0F4

0xC2C4949F
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x556EA91E
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0xD369B807
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x0164986E
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0xA64104FE
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0xA6BD34A9
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0xD54CD650
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x4F984225
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x1A5CAA4E
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0xB031F79C
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x5A15E9AA
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x22103524
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0x7DBAF0FC
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0x4CD5DC17
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x0BBC1D51
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0xA1CDE256
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0x6B78F34C
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x463F8B1F
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x4C93C0C3
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0xD194AA0E
and content.
0xF25CB3FB

0xC2C4949F
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x0009886F
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0xF6412E74
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x6CD1CA1A
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0xDF002980
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x6C3F4910
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0xF0D2B128
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0xC7148500
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0x3CB837D3
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x3BD8C37B
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x40FCC0A9
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x5D3BA6CF
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xE04D9AC9
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0x4778277D
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x45541B19
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0x63F78A2C
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x122978A2
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0xB27CB034
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xBA149212
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x2E1BAB42
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0xEFF299B2
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x261B67C9
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x648DF101
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xE695173B
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x56D19ACD
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x2B601B9E

0xC2C4949F
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x9CE8E15B
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x5A0E9493
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xEF8865EF
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0xEB019F4F
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0x7971C79E
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0xA589900C
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x41F913A8
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0x44E84E43
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x96F96617
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0xAAB05957
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0xC71A6694
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0xD7D956D3
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x0F73403A
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x87698494
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0xC0928458
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0xBD07B8E1
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x58EDB532
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x85CAD131

0xC2C4949F
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x8B056EA6
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x7F60849F
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0xDADF9B26
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x098AA68E
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x80C18D95
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x1305D155
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x9985C0EF
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x741FA7B4
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0xBC1B286C
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x5C085F44

0xC2C4949F
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x319A5B3D
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0xA9290BE5
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x766BB972

0xC2C4949F
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x772DB2A1
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xBD4E1C5A
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x617684BE
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0xD33DC40D
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x881188B0
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0x72429640
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0xCC1DDA10
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x93999191
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0x1C27D8A9
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0xDD1F38D4
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x589D3B8B

0xC2C4949F
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x62DC3896
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x3E9DB87D
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x27A0B64F
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x1117AE76
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x0DEB1AD4
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x190C91A1
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0xB9B1C11D
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0xC12A2841
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0x84E96CED
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0xD0C2A9FD
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xCC3FEC70
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0xA40A332D
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0xB23FAF68
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x84491C18
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x3FB49956
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0xFC662AD7
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x03B74BC9
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0xA578548A
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x6C81B2A9
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x098E9283
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0xAAC3E2FF
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x27C22793
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0xB8BD1BA6
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x63EB3833
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x4E1E209C
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0x97F7E574
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x4673EC85
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x4AFABDA7
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xA760A562
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x7765D69A
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0x8FC7CA15
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0xE2AAED13

0xC2C4949F
She closed her lips.
0x1D87821C

0xC2C4949F
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x4595A388
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0x9FAF2D78
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x89F42166
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0x4A13AEC1
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x1569BAB7
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x4C0A1C68
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x1CFCE992
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x13405746
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0xCD1C6E0C

0xC2C4949F
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0x563F637D
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x234FE177
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0x36B8D2FA
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x88CA8008
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x69212B75

0xC2C4949F
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0xB0A65BE3
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0xD53435D3
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x74AC4DA2
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x2AFFDEBB
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x156C3C43
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x936530DE

0xC2C4949F
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0xBFAE8B8A
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0xB2E6E47B
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0xFFFA80B3
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x8C327776
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x325052AD
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0xD7176522
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x3C1E283F
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0xFD99951E
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0xE0304EB1
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x963ECF1F

0xC2C4949F
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0x798C0628
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0xA49D72E7
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0x7C08D777
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x5DCBBBEA

0xC2C4949F
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x365AF9E9
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0x9D54B478
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x3D341058
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0xAB98E74E
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x335B5A38
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x88C431E0
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x786AFA2C

0xC2C4949F
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x39DA8158
her.
0xF103C1DC

0xC2C4949F
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x2E9B1622

0xC2C4949F
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x0D76FD42
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x631CA75A
me--where is Bessie?"
0xD11A4A06

0xC2C4949F
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0xB784E01C

0xC2C4949F
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xDC88227D
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x2B85ABD5
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x05E90F1A

0xC2C4949F
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xE7FDDC9C
identity.
0xE2930530

0xC2C4949F
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0xE0FDB346
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x38EA02F8
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0xD9AC767D
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x17B6A2B2
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0xC9A6ED4B
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0x311B1316

0xC2C4949F
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x2B1EC1FE
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xB338EA7D
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0xF5205119
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0xAC6E51BE
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x0F17E756

0xC2C4949F
I assured her we were alone.
0x38F555D9

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xF5BCD671
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x37A251A2
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x383D54A3
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x4D4283B3
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0xC16221B5

0xC2C4949F
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xDAC26ACC
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0xC74B51FF
of the last pang.
0x68C2DF7A

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x41C4FCD1
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0xB066132B
there."
0x1D9A4C18

0xC2C4949F
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0x2837DE88

0xC2C4949F
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0x6B3978A9

0xC2C4949F
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0x73B174A9
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0xB99AB276
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0xEB85F868
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0xFA47D7EB
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x550A921E
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x6C3247C5

0xC2C4949F
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x464D1589

0xC2C4949F
It was dated three years back.
0x130721BF

0xC2C4949F
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x3E13D7D7

0xC2C4949F
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x95D644F2
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x02658ED7
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0xFF5C1987
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x76FA9CC9
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x184E3FB3
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x0CF12679
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x412F46DA
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0xF9546B5A
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0xBA1F37CD
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x6BF76117

0xC2C4949F
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0xFEDD1E58
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x3C78918B
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x1AD1BE2F
passed since that day."
0x6DFE49C4

0xC2C4949F
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0x0C6545B8
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0xAEC9CA56

0xC2C4949F
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x1CE24C50
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x93CB8A65
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x19F3D8A4
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x3713673A
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x4288CB2C
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0xDE135EC7
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0xADEA0C47
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x4A90B0B6

0xC2C4949F
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0x5AF02D38
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0x0511BCFC

0xC2C4949F
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0xB82BC5A1
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0x18A17855
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x6997B645
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x44537B52

0xC2C4949F
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x2F692F5E
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x4D1E2933
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0xD9ED6812
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x30578319

0xC2C4949F
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0xDEF773E5
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x1542A98C
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x7FF3CA45
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0xED38B206
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x64E3A656

0xC2C4949F
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x98D77106
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x8DF471A8

0xC2C4949F
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0xB41FE819
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x3E8AFABD
she must hate me still.
0xD8EDBC35

0xC2C4949F
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x89D11ACB
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0x86676049
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0x6B3AA9BB
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x1FD82DD4
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0xAB5D2C75
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0x1DC4AEB0
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x623761FE
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0x7E86888F
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0xC1BCE4BD
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x06F14866
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xAADEA809
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0xD53D2CF7
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x98217196
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0xF9425048
form.
0xA9703F5F

0xC2C4949F
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x813682CA
observed--
0xA73E7FBF

0xC2C4949F
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x9AA7BAFD
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x7745A08A
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x896893F2
Neither of us had dropt a tear.
0x690111B0

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXII
0xCC6696C2

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0xA5A56EB0
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0xDC4D963C
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0xB18B60A5
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x478142FD
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x170EAF0A
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x3B61E493
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x395C9421
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x75B3191A
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x1F742F70
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x60C35CDC
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0xE604EF29
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x6254041A
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0x6FF9E8F8
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x45955F17
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0xEAE6F6D7
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x3E8EA891
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xE46B355B
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x15872F3D
patient and compliant on my part."
0xE0761564

0xC2C4949F
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x8F7D2CB9
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x471854F4
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0x2BCDE18F
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x2FCA2B9E
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0xA8ABA2F6
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0xFA19B168
notes of condolence.
0x35CB01F2

0xC2C4949F
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0x76756E02
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x685DBB56
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0x6956FB22
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0x1AC76E93
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x6AE721F6
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0xA994F723
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x02208F0A
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x888D6D35
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x193A8ABB
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0x26A23097
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x921541CD
veil."
0x5DF64A72

0xC2C4949F
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0xFAC0AE85
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0xED625395
good may it do you!"
0xC5228A29

0xC2C4949F
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0xB81449F1
you have some sense."
0x0937DAF9

0xC2C4949F
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0xD59C8CC5
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0xC1AE02DE
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xA3741D1B
much care."
0xE146FB04

0xC2C4949F
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x82C0ACC9
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x3BA4EBE1
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xFE27B6B4
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0xF652E261
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0xECE3103F
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x49CE5551
fortune.
0x2D7B785F

0xC2C4949F
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x23EF28A2
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0xF337A171
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0xC786E30A
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x59B12EC5
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0xFDCA5F00
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0x58654448
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0xC037EC1C
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x3031D7B5
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0xB85F16C0

0xC2C4949F
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0xBBC76D4F
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x784DE295
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x5BBF9BC7
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0x44FDC50A
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x182CB48A
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x726AD014
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0xE1B43605
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0xCA714409
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x254B0298
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x17AD7C08
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0x4DE5B6E4
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x40E9FB8D

0xC2C4949F
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xBE7B2128
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0xA046E129
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0xB148D372
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x9A8F8A79
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0xDD58C5AD
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x060B505B
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xAEB3F4A6
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x6E51B1C0
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x42CAA16F
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x66659524
don't doubt it."
0x437886FF

0xC2C4949F
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x9C9BD6F9
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xA901C1FC
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xEA846E64
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xA1FBE056
both her and me.
0x1AFD7260

0xC2C4949F
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0x9C124987
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0xA3E12936
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x9779EC19
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0x58476561
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x1D1E3673
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x960B4F10

0xC2C4949F
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0x8C86E9B5
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x9F56D2B3
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x697E8A6C
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0xACA47B7E
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x13DB877D
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x91322FAE
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0x0AE6F019

0xC2C4949F
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0xD9563B5D
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x4E27B860
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0xD0A28339
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xC987B9A7
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xB888B987
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x99703375
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0xBB680FA0

0xC2C4949F
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x92551D0F
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x40E8C022
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xF28BE227
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x0888F6C6
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xE449BF77
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x6F4D60BC
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xDA18737B

0xC2C4949F
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x6F30CB28
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0x66F98BDD
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x478E6D67
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x59EC8475
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x9F1BDFCC
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xE308F66C
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0xEBFF9E47
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x2AFA5D6B

0xC2C4949F
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x2580801C
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0xB00AF2C1
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x1E8336D4
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0x030B2A11
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0x3260DC07
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x466ADAEB

0xC2C4949F
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x6DF1E84A
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xB20E6948

0xC2C4949F
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x50733E11
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x4932C501
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0x4AB7FCD6
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x18E74BB0
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x5AC2DA9D
behave with decent composure.
0x56A07BB7

0xC2C4949F
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0xC812736F
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0xB94B32BB
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x2913BD36
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0x2A436DE9
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x0C6E9CE7
month?"
0x7987995A

0xC2C4949F
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x13B7892A

0xC2C4949F
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0x95B3369F
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0xE8F24D15
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0xF0FD7FC1
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x8A89ADF9
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0x82ABAE37
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x713FB9BD
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x8DDB8FA2

0xC2C4949F
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x8EE911FC
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x6C420001
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0xEA3D6D1F
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x70F0D965
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x48E33954
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x14DEA515
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xC72D0319
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0xBF263D43
that it were my home!
0x4516D7FB

0xC2C4949F
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x87B972B4
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0x1C0319B0

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0x434556E1

0xC2C4949F
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x92B2A40F

0xC2C4949F
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xD7DA3FB5

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x2685E1D1

0xC2C4949F
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x12D09D22
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0xA07C5409
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x1188CC8B
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0x8B745911
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x6D3DEBBE
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x64066321

0xC2C4949F
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x24ED837D
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x82AE2831
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x59D10C94

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0xFF58045A
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x215A825D
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x0B7F7559
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x7A8C25FA
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0x536457BA
shed it over me now.
0x0DF29B37

0xC2C4949F
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0x08ED119B
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x571CEA58

0xC2C4949F
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x5016085C
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0x677146CB
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0xBE1736EC
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xE8F58C6D

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0xCD99F965
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0xF7F25C23

0xC2C4949F
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x47ACFAFC
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x70B7C437
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x3117DEC4
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0xBEE33B01
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xD0AF25A1
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0xAC2E1CF6

0xC2C4949F
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0xA581A45A
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x6D486455
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0xFD906C94
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xBCF9857C
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x555053BE
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0x5BFD745B
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0xB20AF4D1
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x25238F82
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x44DB02D2
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0xE21E405B
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x872598FC
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x5CB9E5E4
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x78A36DCB
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x0A4A8794

0xC2C4949F
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0xE0DF98C8
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x98342113
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0x5B8095C7
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x07DAA8F9
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x6ED9A90B
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0xD1CB5769
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xFE4BAE0C

0xC2C4949F
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x6DCAD406
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0xFDF86895
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0xF065B41C
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0xA9DC6ED6
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x1AAE115B
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0x56049F0F
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x1C719324
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x07C21C22
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x341EBA28
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0x3F85264B
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0x75F9BCA9
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xEBF8A9BF
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.
0x0E8906FE

CHAPTER XXIII
0xB288E7F0

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x465B6755
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x9F711655
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0xF19D6852
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x9AAD3D49
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x6F6C20FA
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x42B1D36D
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x9A153822
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x74F6855A

0xC2C4949F
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x90EFA081
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0x34134C09
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0x9A5846EB

0xC2C4949F
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0xC7CDE81C
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x74AC3EE8
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0xC741D79A
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x60D6F15F
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0x55B8E132
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x65420F4A
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0x8E50D476
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xD04740E0

0xC2C4949F
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x06AE9220
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x6250E06B
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0xF250B6ED
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x669FFE00
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x383D46D5
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0xE311E944
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0xC3DED11F
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x4C326DA7
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0xB84CEF55
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x8058C5A1
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x3F8E5936
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x20537D2E
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xB19ED211
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x38B6DCF0
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0xD57C438C

0xC2C4949F
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0xE627FB4E
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0xE266D37F
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0xAFC57EAC
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0xB8F9971D
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0xC1203532
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x80EC3179
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x196BEBC9
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x3736E38F
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x40B08B98

0xC2C4949F
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x1F17DD66
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0x93C4AC0E
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0xB45A5A28
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xA8163FBA
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xAFE0FF70
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x972738BC
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xF53F3BD4

0xC2C4949F
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x0C7D96D4
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x12717625

0xC2C4949F
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0x493CB693
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0x65C3E0A6
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x15A44096
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0x01EDDF25
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x5E3B0B61
turning--
0xA18037DB

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0xA12E16AC

0xC2C4949F
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0xA7945316
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x0065F443

0xC2C4949F
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x0377892D
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xE5BF0CF1
there! he is flown."
0xB1632A2E

0xC2C4949F
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x8AABEF88
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x2AFD4CA5

0xC2C4949F
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0x175D80E0
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0xBA6D1B27
moonrise."
0x3CE1C2B1

0xC2C4949F
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xEA3FFFB3
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x57645160
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0xFA3B721A
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x63BC4722
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0x9690BCD6
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0xE34A59D4
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x5E2ED178
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0xDAA717B4
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0xEA5A00D4
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x42C19234
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x6615C80B

0xC2C4949F
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0xBF9ED53D
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x37EB536D
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x1D293ABC

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0x20574363
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xE6FB31B9
Adhesiveness?"
0xEB3A0537

0xC2C4949F
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x6FF11E96

0xC2C4949F
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x96ACB54E
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x7E75CC93
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x46603EFC

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0xE3167F94

0xC2C4949F
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0x01F5B0E1

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xF51847C2
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x045605FF
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x3EAD6F2F
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x32C1E3FE

0xC2C4949F
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0x96B1E7A2

0xC2C4949F
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0xAF3C59AE
must."
0x47A11347

0xC2C4949F
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0x527957C1

0xC2C4949F
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0x8BB396C4

0xC2C4949F
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0x7EE2D0F1

0xC2C4949F
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0x287D3A7C

0xC2C4949F
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0x61E8D934
straight on the head."
0x174C584D

0xC2C4949F
"Soon, sir?"
0xD16D3CF7

0xC2C4949F
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x62A9B682
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xA4AA1A41
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x0C5E939E
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0xA10FB703
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0x4B47BE65
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0xAE391A6A
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x1D3F5101
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x4F9905F4
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x68B084E3
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x9E09D54E
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0x5BC14813
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x36C7CF3A
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x39B9CEE2
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x66BE3A51
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x7832251A
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x7F3D14D0
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0xF1D5D177

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xF919381A
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x70CA433D
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x7EDECAFD
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0x7AB8AB51

0xC2C4949F
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xFF081D43
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x8142CD1C
for you."
0x15F1BAC6

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0xA0A4EB5F

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0xCAF52370
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x716F03C0
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x4C030B68
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x7FF05D89
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0xCE9B1D2A
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0xA1EB9B9C
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x415F68AF

0xC2C4949F
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x6360C552

0xC2C4949F
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0xB5BFABAA
distance."
0xA5366119

0xC2C4949F
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x2BCDB525

0xC2C4949F
"From what, Jane?"
0x38AA27FE

0xC2C4949F
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0x80943B5A

0xC2C4949F
"Well?"
0x2BC6707D

0xC2C4949F
"From _you_, sir."
0xBCE6C910

0xC2C4949F
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x3CC91475
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0xFC46DEB0
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0xCA278E1B
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0x8A3B9804
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0xF53DBE99
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0x8C92D1F1
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0x811683D7
loved.
0x7F4ED930

0xC2C4949F
"It is a long way," I again said.
0x555B643D

0xC2C4949F
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0xD5721CBC
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x26AB7FC3
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x322A7F9A
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0xE4EF23F7

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xE5F431EF
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0x03480527
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x268EFB21
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0x92248689
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0x4DE84AF1
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x8C622D3B
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0xBCF3EC6F

0xC2C4949F
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0xFD4148D2
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0xA48343E5
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x92A3A1DD

0xC2C4949F
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0xA253D34B

0xC2C4949F
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x37949372
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x44186BE6
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0x8CD96667
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x5F00BBDD
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0xE6F79CC0
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x6233B9E9
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0xF0E09CEC
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0xF2936BC4

0xC2C4949F
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x2970A093

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x6E912AA0

0xC2C4949F
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0xEF5D3AC4
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0xF8514CC1
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x94ADF754
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xF64DC990

0xC2C4949F
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0x7F710CA0

0xC2C4949F
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x5C61D920
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0xFE5BD98B
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x2850828A
speak.
0x0E3F71A4

0xC2C4949F
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x613DFE50
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x2100E6F0
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x984D2083
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x72F3C6CC
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0x72499EA1
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x5D3C3B7F
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0xFFCF1F77
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0x050DA2FB
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0xA67C26F0
on the necessity of death."
0xFFF0B79C

0xC2C4949F
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x3598C5F6

0xC2C4949F
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0xBCB70055

0xC2C4949F
"In what shape?"
0xE2BEB78D

0xC2C4949F
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x031BAFC0

0xC2C4949F
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0x6412358B

0xC2C4949F
"But you will have."
0xC2FF83FF

0xC2C4949F
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x8D7F8DBC

0xC2C4949F
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x8DED1581

0xC2C4949F
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0x3A8D5DCC

0xC2C4949F
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x4730C056
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xE6A4B5FE
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x8F6407EB
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x938A177E
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0x8E64B915
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x209B01C7
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x69DA7FBD
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0x2406AE47
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x5074003E
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0x12C3D5C3
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0xEB45EED3
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x9FBA5A0A

0xC2C4949F
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0xB9F60F9B
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x7AD73792
Jane!"
0x876E4E3D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x3442F67C
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xA6C574EA
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x0B6A3DAA
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x70BCFE82
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x5CD97986

0xC2C4949F
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x24E946DC

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x8C2778CA

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0x2479BFCC
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x9A526053

0xC2C4949F
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x1A9458A6
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0x126EB9E7

0xC2C4949F
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0xBB41E7C9

0xC2C4949F
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x95E9E5AF
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0xB1E393AB

0xC2C4949F
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0x2E1F5774

0xC2C4949F
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x919AD941
best earthly companion."
0x674C12CA

0xC2C4949F
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x643B91FE

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0x320FE011
too."
0x9902AA15

0xC2C4949F
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x898F4C04
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x391459FD
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x6FCD0F1A
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0x0E813E80
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x8156D575
said--
0xD489085A

0xC2C4949F
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0x3633A41F

0xC2C4949F
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0xCAE342FB
return."
0x29460421

0xC2C4949F
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x301419AC

0xC2C4949F
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0x4AAFBFC7

0xC2C4949F
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0xEA4DA1DE

0xC2C4949F
"Your bride stands between us."
0x1A5A31E7

0xC2C4949F
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x8B40659C

0xC2C4949F
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0xD200D74D
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x50231267

0xC2C4949F
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x975A2D1A
was still incredulous.
0x87B6E562

0xC2C4949F
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x1A871CBC

0xC2C4949F
"Entirely."
0x5FF20985

0xC2C4949F
"You have no faith in me?"
0x631BAB87

0xC2C4949F
"Not a whit."
0x789648AE

0xC2C4949F
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0xA4A18B11
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x448EA9FB
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x4C3494F4
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0xBA137068
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0xAA7D9459
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x7EF8AF59
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0x8D895D90
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x2AC17E01
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x5147BDB8

0xC2C4949F
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0xBE91D2E8
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x69D40E15
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x9BD30656
given me?"
0xEE3AA1B2

0xC2C4949F
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0xB3669E1A
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0xA92B596E

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x71D9F4B6

0xC2C4949F
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0xC2C4949F
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x76B85C77

0xC2C4949F
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x8F2FBE9C
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x69D19308

0xC2C4949F
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x35FE1B1A
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0xE0029724

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x76FD9AAE
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0x357EF39C

0xC2C4949F
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0xF8700D26
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x090F38F2

0xC2C4949F
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0x154742DD
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x0E5F23D4

0xC2C4949F
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x3930EA67
be your wife?"
0x491A459B

0xC2C4949F
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x33F9C317

0xC2C4949F
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0x3C35B0B9

0xC2C4949F
"Edward--my little wife!"
0x32DE72F8

0xC2C4949F
"Dear Edward!"
0x7FBE3A6E

0xC2C4949F
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x0B7A0A9D
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x330EE2F3
happiness--I will make yours."
0x03212C3D

0xC2C4949F
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0xF95FC920
have her, and will hold her."
0x0C6ECB41

0xC2C4949F
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0xC1B737DC

0xC2C4949F
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xDD2B9777
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0xD93DA29B
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x674540A8
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0xF43310EF
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x01409EED
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x46BF3C20
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xCC663E35
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x2A57FDE6
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xDC0A8ABF
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x5AF21D89
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x131FB1FF

0xC2C4949F
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x5D0C8A83
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0xBC9B0BA6
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x51412449
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x86B40CAC

0xC2C4949F
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x91E4C2E5
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x273AA3C4

0xC2C4949F
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0xF12C7634
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0xCAD8A349
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0x699229BE
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0xBA784831

0xC2C4949F
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0x3BD00D31
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xC9FB2EA5
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0xB60F7A44
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x91B460FB
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x0211BD84
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xDF6FDAB4

0xC2C4949F
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x054E8D5B
night--good-night, my darling!"
0xC3317E82

0xC2C4949F
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0xDF861217
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x35D5820D
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x65C79A4A
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x6B188B7B
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0xD81F775E
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x5D840E9A
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xBCB71F1A
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x01476E1B
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x0B7AA379
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0xFA96993A
strength for anything.
0xF9A31703

0xC2C4949F
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x76A802D7
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0xB0A17C8F
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0x560E74E8

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXIV
0x8EB5929E

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x54E99D92
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xA62DE0C6
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0xDD7F7A3A

0xC2C4949F
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x15F1C251
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x5B88D5B3
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0xCB476F33
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0x27FDCBA1
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x613E5DAA
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x01CD7A3B
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0xF070C1EC
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0xEF1D5B8C
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xEAD538D6

0xC2C4949F
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0xBBBB3217
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x40D2154C
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x77C402E9
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x0EF1396B
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x8CCCBD14
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0x55252394
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0xCE0E79D4
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0x840116E7
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x8676763F

0xC2C4949F
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x456C582E
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x68F12363
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0x223EBFCE
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x9587AC54
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0xA8D52E97
schoolroom.
0xAB395D5E

0xC2C4949F
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x9E0FFBED

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0xDF1D4FD8

0xC2C4949F
"Where is he?"
0xA9B48A7A

0xC2C4949F
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x465DC2B3
there he stood.
0x4747811A

0xC2C4949F
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xD4504729
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x9E9F2975
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x4D1A43A9
well loved, so caressed by him.
0xCD79D454

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0xC4396016
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0xAE572DE5
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x5D1C8CE1
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0x505FF4A5
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x0D21CF7C
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x974CC6D7

0xC2C4949F
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x1DDD1996

0xC2C4949F
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0xE93E117C
more.  Do you hear that?"
0xDD0AABD7

0xC2C4949F
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x50184591
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x5085DDB0
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0xE67DE08A
think almost fear.
0x050F64EA

0xC2C4949F
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0xB843FF00

0xC2C4949F
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0xCC976C75
strange."
0x6C02240D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x75C5580E
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xC407EF26

0xC2C4949F
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xBA9BA11F
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0xBDEAFE6B
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x95FB82B6
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0xC5DD2A6E

0xC2C4949F
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0x261A62BA
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x2C51B139
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0x7B6DD83E
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x8B6C2ABC
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0x2A54007E

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0xE947C160
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x8568FA7F
have them."
0xA8DEC9AB

0xC2C4949F
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0x04F826DF
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0x19BFD39B
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0x504F5581
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0x951EEDBE

0xC2C4949F
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x573F010D
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0xDB13551E
Quakerish governess."
0x7E38003B

0xC2C4949F
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xBC3FFB21
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x5733575B

0xC2C4949F
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x2DD66CC5
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0x2CDDCB19

0xC2C4949F
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0x0636E99A
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0xD9DA2687
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0x2C3BEA54
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0xBDB9B4B9
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0xE02D4517

0xC2C4949F
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x6AA364E5
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0xA7E77298
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x98624E3D
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0xE23D5B46
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x63C2FB23
flatter me."
0x90977365

0xC2C4949F
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0xACFC0BBC
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0xCABD9D54
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0xABC08010
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x431DC523
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0xBE5A7C63
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xC69FEBA7
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x4E8B2D77
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x35DAD6F7
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0xCB4A2A48

0xC2C4949F
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x718AD9C7

0xC2C4949F
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0xCDBCF887
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0xDBCE1588
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0x3FA3858F
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x96F1540E
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x0B293B1F
as my comforter."
0xDB38FE1F

0xC2C4949F
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0x98FBFC53
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xDD4AAB70
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x1D8815E7
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0xAEFEE525
anticipate."
0xE6C410ED

0xC2C4949F
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x83F3F6D3

0xC2C4949F
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x1BDCD323
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x85939DF1
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0xD2AD9241
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x148AB643
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0xFE2E6132
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x8C22141E
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x65341DCB
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0xF073047E
dear master."
0x736827B5

0xC2C4949F
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x9C44AAA0
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x27EA9CFB
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0x79C0A2CD

0xC2C4949F
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0xB1188653

0xC2C4949F
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x3F6E60BF
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0xD0BF6385
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x11D35EE8
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x43A4C336
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x82C026F2
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x36528A6F

0xC2C4949F
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0x22B5195F
such an one?"
0xE45C6A0D

0xC2C4949F
"I love it now."
0x6286E159

0xC2C4949F
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x837B6122
standard?"
0xC6B872A7

0xC2C4949F
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0x3CDC84DD
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0xAD737A33
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x785EFB5A
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x23F9D3D2
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x2CEA9DFA
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x0B7A4396
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0xFC2BF4F6

0xC2C4949F
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0xFF9C0C9B
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x73798A6D

0xC2C4949F
"You were, you little elfish--"
0x4A3F934C

0xC2C4949F
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0xA0BB2ECA
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0x038C7AB9
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0xB1D5E11E
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x04803663
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x11A6535A
pleasure to grant."
0x96A18554

0xC2C4949F
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x3F53AF6C

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0x88F5F12C

0xC2C4949F
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x4D74063E
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0xC914AE3D

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0xF31BDE1B
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0xECF75376
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x6B818049

0xC2C4949F
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0x88B2AD8C
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x9F588553
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0xD74BC338
withdrawn: try again."
0x52488CD0

0xC2C4949F
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x00011448
piqued on one point."
0xD844AC79

0xC2C4949F
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x662B5D7E
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0xA1CA8885
request--"
0xB9A6E8A6

0xC2C4949F
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0x47F55ACC

0xC2C4949F
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0x93C2682B
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x942F7C1E

0xC2C4949F
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0xA9085C33
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0xA645DFA9
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0xE37DFB37
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0x397303DA

0xC2C4949F
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x65061F15
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0x5707EC2A
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x0AEB0661

0xC2C4949F
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0x03496D57
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0xC2A7F434
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x3DF53AA9
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0x93CBD2CB
of my power?"
0xC5D66610

0xC2C4949F
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0xEAA17E45
up."
0x62BFD7AA

0xC2C4949F
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0xB9B16828
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0xBD505FBC
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0x768B364A
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0xF91F8936

0xC2C4949F
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0xBF42A8D1
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0xCE1F019C
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0xAC7CBBF4

0xC2C4949F
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0x6DA3EB0E
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x7521DEC1
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0x694D492E
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x62FFFA22

0xC2C4949F
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x9C823F10
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x0E22FCC7
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x2FBB4FD9
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x5D187164
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x50731AAB
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x6D4A7A63
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x90B7BD6C
made me the offer."
0xDE22ADD6

0xC2C4949F
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0xF1F1E1B4

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x6F51B5BE
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x3D05D39B
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0xDFDD9567

0xC2C4949F
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x1DAA5C84
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x615F9F09
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x95E90B5C

0xC2C4949F
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xA9CD788F
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x090B063C

0xC2C4949F
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x5F54DECF
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x0F053144
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x84DBE6AC
deserted?"
0xC8CC464D

0xC2C4949F
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0xC885A79C
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0xE2F0E285
moment."
0x7D775797

0xC2C4949F
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0xA82B4B70
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x429525B4

0xC2C4949F
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0x725AD37B
awry for want of attention."
0x3590ABC4

0xC2C4949F
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0xEF09EE60
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x64C17949
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x6F503FFB

0xC2C4949F
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x897D5F17
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x2BA8356C
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0x41AA13CA

0xC2C4949F
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x6104A48E
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x4C23D386
express.
0x2B8595A3

0xC2C4949F
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0xD7A0B44A
entreated, and to yield."
0x69B3B867

0xC2C4949F
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0x41BA3DA8
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x155BBEAA
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0xE08D7936
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x21F7063A

0xC2C4949F
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x1024173F
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0xDB9D5AF4
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x4BCE45E2
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x5B0C1788

0xC2C4949F
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0xB44D3587

0xC2C4949F
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0xFDF7C25E
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xF6C9E0AE

0xC2C4949F
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x92C15534
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xA97DCEDE
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0xE535219B
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0xFB5A7EFD
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x16AB4297
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0xAA93CF13
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x6E497283
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0xEBE12C2E
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x3D246DF8
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0x215FDC0D

0xC2C4949F
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0xBA418441
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x73739A0E
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0xDCEE017A
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x55AF0972
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0xC3A71406
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0x0F971E44
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0x7DA797ED
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0xC3BDFB66
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x336F6D6C
you would be his wife."
0x35741C3A

0xC2C4949F
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x9324DA6F

0xC2C4949F
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0xF8DEC98C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x16746C5C
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0x7C1B024F
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x6D78C7BE

0xC2C4949F
"He tells me so."
0xED11AE44

0xC2C4949F
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0xC5708688
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0xF6B2B820

0xC2C4949F
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0xF4F6269F
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x04DC4228
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x838D15D7
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0xD0DA791F
father."
0x4643F91B

0xC2C4949F
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x9BEDCD17
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0xEECA7D31
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x7C7CEDDF
twenty."
0x89B3411B

0xC2C4949F
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x216C71CC

0xC2C4949F
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0xC4361012
eyes.
0x99694706

0xC2C4949F
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x82B683E4
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x58A44444
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x2920B4FB
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0x720F90BE
I expect."
0xEF8895D2

0xC2C4949F
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0x6E7031D5
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x4ADC0C87

0xC2C4949F
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x57D276A0
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x7B490502
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0x93BFD502
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0xFE0DEA99
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x7AC78AF6
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0xCF6F3E67
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0xED66926F
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0xD21D4C01
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x0E246835
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x953A0AF7
him."
0x10103776

0xC2C4949F
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x7A6AEFEF
that all was right."
0x41C2F8E2

0xC2C4949F
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xFCABB6EA
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x6C4CAA4B
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xA4EB6F91
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0xA7001580

0xC2C4949F
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0x52126828

0xC2C4949F
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x73C974B4
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0x177C8A6D
me go mademoiselle."
0x76085061

0xC2C4949F
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x41E393C6
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0xFABC347F
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0x0C439F3C
backwards and forwards.
0x3261A71A

0xC2C4949F
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0xE93E0B13

0xC2C4949F
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0x272892A9

0xC2C4949F
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0xF5A37598

0xC2C4949F
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x4DB8AFF6

0xC2C4949F
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x0A5ED4AE
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x0DCF0A1F
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0xD782883F
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0xBB45B38B
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x6DF144C4
my face.
0xF69BE96E

0xC2C4949F
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x65521339
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xEA1B0187

0xC2C4949F
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0xCB67F610

0xC2C4949F
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x8BD50991
to Adele.
0x5BE35982

0xC2C4949F
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0xA7A237CC

0xC2C4949F
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x7ED97A85
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x2D527566
company--for life."
0xD696D4C4

0xC2C4949F
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0xF9360C76
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0xAA02E0A9
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0xEFCFE5A8
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x33EAD25C
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0xA6B07A4A

0xC2C4949F
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x8130A609
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x81C70B45

0xC2C4949F
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0x744F9911
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xBBF0D400

0xC2C4949F
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0xE8A02329
mademoiselle?"
0x01EE5E29

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xBC795BDB
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x74693CC6
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x80FD395B
there, and only me."
0x466E8F71

0xC2C4949F
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xC2ADCB92

0xC2C4949F
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x90CD97E9
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0xD33EDFED

0xC2C4949F
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0x1F783A89

0xC2C4949F
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x5F968382
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xCD34FA80

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x001F3493
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0xBE50ABC6

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x6C5AD880
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x5A673603
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x8B670664
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0x196BA678

0xC2C4949F
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0x7992FD4A
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0x5E7E23AD
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x2186574D

0xC2C4949F
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x3435D5BA

0xC2C4949F
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x7FE488A3
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0xC0392E33

0xC2C4949F
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x2C358688
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0x12823132
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x86EB12B8
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x60C83B8C

0xC2C4949F
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xC89B86CE
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0xDE227035
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x792BD860
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0xE6081DA9
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0xB5290A0B
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x4C656DDA
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x1A775E34
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0x6E074AA0
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x649559B9
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xD0B8ADF7
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x74B0F1EA
effect--
0x6A162BBC

0xC2C4949F
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0x7EC31A53
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0x4BD7B9BC
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x5E611BE0
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x29536CFC
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0xDD560D53
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x7B41B457

0xC2C4949F
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x7560B6F7
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x44982C04
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x4E515B00
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xD75DFAAF
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x7D3EFE63
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x32A61F20
again."
0x8DD35BEA

0xC2C4949F
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x4E11DCB0
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0xF14EE900

0xC2C4949F
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x61415BFD
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x19764CA1
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x78DF3F6E
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0xD82C157A
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0xF65B974D
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x8005F61F
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x5D6869B7

0xC2C4949F
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x99B95651
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x3F49151B
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x702BD97A
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x99FEB792
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x38290314
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xBFDFF3E9
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x0519C6DD
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x17CC9A5F
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0xEB81700A
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0xEA92DE46
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0xB6437FD1
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x87887E2F
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0xCF907F45
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xCF45B233

0xC2C4949F
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0x53C0E73D
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x9C925B28
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0xA59ACDB2
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xF304B696
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0x54913331
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0x27FC1A02
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0xF644BD71
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x0C1723ED
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x7BB23A5D
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x4B8C03EB
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x3186F6EB
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x1A157758
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0xA0B1ABC5
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x2335A918
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x2CA80834
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x948E4F3F
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x441754C6
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0xA43751A0
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0xDE6AEB9A
passionate pressure.
0x2DE58F0C

0xC2C4949F
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x23A4F66E
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x6AC33050
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x43447D2E
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x4E2FC54B
satin."
0xAAC07F40

0xC2C4949F
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x31DB067B
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0xDE0B4FDD
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x599E89DA
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x6D132016

0xC2C4949F
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0xAE912915
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0xD56EA6D0
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x3BCCA686
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0xD7CF43F0
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0xFC9D7D43
satisfactorily here."
0xB5BD2673

0xC2C4949F
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xFC2AF6AD
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x4390B1F5

0xC2C4949F
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x46B6D1BB
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0xECF1F765
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0x2601A93F
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0x694CE255
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x49EAAA86
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0xD53515B1

0xC2C4949F
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0xB9E6B961

0xC2C4949F
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0xB7691490
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x88831EA9
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0xAAF2F4D7
would be to violate its conditions."
0x171E9FCB

0xC2C4949F
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x4014EB31
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0x4BC52F02
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0x95ED4E7A

0xC2C4949F
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0xB79FD9D9
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x11FA2464
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0xA35F0AC6
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0xB241B44C
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0x69B8A774
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0x287348B1

0xC2C4949F
"Well, but what?"
0xB6A6317F

0xC2C4949F
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0xE83C4174

0xC2C4949F
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x6ECEACEC
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x02759FBB
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0x17204F75

0xC2C4949F
"No, thank you, sir."
0x1BBC5F61

0xC2C4949F
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0xAAD6E111

0xC2C4949F
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0xBC0B5677
till--"
0x10CA12D1

0xC2C4949F
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0x8C2538AB

0xC2C4949F
"Till I can't help it."
0x2A8F5E70

0xC2C4949F
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0x3096086D
companion of my repast?"
0x7BBE67E4

0xC2C4949F
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0x81E48C03
usual for another month."
0xA35795F0

0xC2C4949F
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0x71639A71

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0x00E1F016
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x9F12BF2D
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0xAF89E789
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0xD0D86414

0xC2C4949F
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x3C621FDA
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0xBCF4B25A
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0xF946E9E5
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0x58958197
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0xF5C198C1
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x1C556C2C
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0xD16D5F9B
my jewel I should tyne."
0xF003751A

0xC2C4949F
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0xC11D4FB7
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x0A40EF38
retreat upstairs.
0x7281A10C

0xC2C4949F
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x71D5DB72
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xC0A25A17
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0xB4D2A5F2
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0xE0735D2D
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x88837E94
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x6AC70C9A
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0xB1180614
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x6CC9CEFB
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x495D1BB7
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x1DA75748
the present.
0xE0630F70

0xC2C4949F
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0xD89765B0

0xC2C4949F
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x4E3E5619
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0xCD14F81F
stimulate it.
0x2B4680E0

0xC2C4949F
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x839A876C

0xC2C4949F
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0xCF798ACA

0xC2C4949F
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x83ABC5BD
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0xC87DA92C
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x98F9A54B
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x8D6658A0
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0xD9FC3F57
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x1CC911DD
strain:--
0x5477B809

0xC2C4949F
   "The truest love that ever heart
0x6D485665
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x2142E80A
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0x6DB84CE4
      The tide of being pour.
0x3CF6E291

0xC2C4949F
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x91FA89FE
      Her parting was my pain;
0x32527081
   The chance that did her steps delay
0x75225C41
      Was ice in every vein.
0x75A560FB

0xC2C4949F
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x2905A35A
      As I loved, loved to be;
0xBBF689BF
   And to this object did I press
0x31862535
      As blind as eagerly.
0x7ECC0BCE

0xC2C4949F
   But wide as pathless was the space
0x9950F101
      That lay our lives between,
0xEDE64D38
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0xB00A15FC
      Of ocean-surges green.
0xFB02BE9D

0xC2C4949F
   And haunted as a robber-path
0x71D4E74D
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x97086D9A
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x58106B29
      Between our spirits stood.
0xACF6C58B

0xC2C4949F
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x8DC7D6A5
      I omens did defy:
0x078C7025
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0xC9BFDCF3
      I passed impetuous by.
0x2E9DF1FF

0xC2C4949F
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x7B42E907
      I flew as in a dream;
0x4EC76B13
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0xC0399129
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x2F25EF3F

0xC2C4949F
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xE43177E7
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0xF5CC4129
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xE043993E
      Disasters gather nigh.
0xF147F52E

0xC2C4949F
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x8A657386
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0xA63DA1EA
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0x35A5E802
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0xB7A9E28B

0xC2C4949F
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x449C65A5
      Right, bar approach to me,
0x449F36EB
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x7D66A812
      Swear endless enmity.
0xF5E82B17

0xC2C4949F
   My love has placed her little hand
0x65D11A16
      With noble faith in mine,
0x28CFBD28
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x493B1E82
      Our nature shall entwine.
0xBEB44ECE

0xC2C4949F
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x556BCDAD
      With me to live--to die;
0x7A0FF712
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xD865691B
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x5256A7B0

0xC2C4949F
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xFEDA78B5
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x7636255C
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x7BC7CADC
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x8A9C3900
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0xEA2EA362
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0x2D65CFCF

0xC2C4949F
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x7A18F26E

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x7E391113
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0x62546E80
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0x2FED3C01

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x6160CBC4
Death was not for such as I."
0xE1E7E85C

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0xCD5C874C
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x37AC45B5

0xC2C4949F
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0x08F7FFD9
reconciling kiss?"
0xD1CF73F0

0xC2C4949F
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x2ED9798D

0xC2C4949F
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x4C48740C
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0xB5078944
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0xE3331E36

0xC2C4949F
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x808EDDB8
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0xDF8EB132
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x4ECA682B
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0x75E4ECC9
time to rescind it.
0x22806376

0xC2C4949F
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x2C70BB1B

0xC2C4949F
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x738A11E1
myself I was doing that now."
0xC3CB47B3

0xC2C4949F
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x1FABDF1A
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0xA9AE9CEE
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x8078991B
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xB14D8039
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x4973B977
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x2E78B102
advantage."
0x38C75A98

0xC2C4949F
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xA06498E3
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x724F8B76
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0xC3C9273C
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x8F30BB90

0xC2C4949F
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0x2101C86A
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xE140A43F
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x3AA6E294
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0xDF4BECAD
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0xE0881660
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x6D68A0DD

0xC2C4949F
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xB07D945E
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x66B9FA8E
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0xF70E1CA1
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x521D4BD4
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x4A812E97
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0xDF56724E
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x62F70E2B
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0x5BDAFE7E
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x4F206B99
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xEDB6598C
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0xB0EEBA55
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0x07451C33
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x8A229D4E
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x3DD1A9F8
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x06C10165
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x136FFED5
virtue, another must be devised."
0xE150493E

0xC2C4949F
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0x152483F8
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x06888F2A
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0x6804DC4D
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x169C53BE
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x52E03097
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x2ADAC363

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x1F882768
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x4DD7CFA2
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x7B08F9B7
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x3E6812F0
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xC775EBCD
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0xEBA59716
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0xBF33794C
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x1CE64D30
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0xCB1A5DF7
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x01FEAD89
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x2E5757AF
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x4EF50F43
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0xD872BD99
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x56CDE713
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0xCBA92A1C
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0x2A3CB048
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x03D27BC0
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x2BA4170F
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0xB7959879
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0xAEEA8F48
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x9325E488
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x7F8C4497
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x11A86FC5

0xC2C4949F
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0x3DFD7513
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x71345D45
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0xF2FAB6F1
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0xED4B3D61
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0xA3E5ACFD
more than they.
0x5A0BC607

0xC2C4949F
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x5B09A387
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x939D9D2C
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x70FA8F90
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0xEB71000F
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0x2021A580
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0xBD4011D6
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x1EC76BA2
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0xA484135E
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0xD34104FC
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0x6F894144

0xC2C4949F
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xBEB26027
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x4B618279
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x4CAC0FC3
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x4761FF33
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xA534BCE7
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x5E007C47
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x439A814F
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x67CF4F01

0xC2C4949F
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0xBFE23F28
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x04048C75
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x2DE3A5C4
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x1DFA6C8F
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x56F41A79
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xF0CB52AB
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x2B6CED49
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0xDF691E84
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x292F76C4
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x5E18FE01

0xC2C4949F
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x872F8BC6
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x9F79F7F4
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x9CA4BF4A
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x340F8B00
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x610F1DB5
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0xC8DEFCCD
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x83CF5ED8
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x72206A74
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0x9DA4109E
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0x197D9B95
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x641FDA9A
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x21E3EE69
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x85F9F5F2
listen to, and I ran off again.
0xE03DB54F

0xC2C4949F
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x4AFB3917
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0xA7D1571C
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x1CD69E7A
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0x1674B52F
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0x115A3DF9
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0xD5B99D0F
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x5CB16DD8
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0x47B3A7F5
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0xA37B170C
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x94C9FE8A
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0x9A3E3AD8
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x81E0AB1E
simultaneously struck ten.
0xA1B01B4A

0xC2C4949F
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x74C6E2ED
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x0B0057F7
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0xCA12E1F1

0xC2C4949F
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0xD5650EE0
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xE634BB29
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0xA484A692
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0xF9CBC46C
by one moving speck.
0xE56088FB

0xC2C4949F
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0x92B0BE25
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xD05C8989
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x16F9DF54
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x73045057

0xC2C4949F
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x3FECDC67
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0xCBA0D4C7
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0xD7F9EEF4
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x35B15C7D
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x3FC19829
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0xAFEDC4AE
meridian, and must now decline.
0xA4583487

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x28DCB668
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0x6274BE0A
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xE64E1DD7

0xC2C4949F
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0x857D9508
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0x2477DAEE
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0x62DB138B
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x7D427B0E
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0xBA3725E5
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x01581AB8

0xC2C4949F
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0x23191153
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x1CD5DFA8
give me both hands: mount!"
0x6F170968

0xC2C4949F
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x0C6DC6DC
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x631B06DF
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x45F1633C
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x83296513
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0xD7831AAB

0xC2C4949F
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0x35DCB412
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0xC3B95177

0xC2C4949F
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0xF9B50ACA
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x94A9254B
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0xE81205C7

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0x6378B38F

0xC2C4949F
"Then you have been both?"
0x4B4A459F

0xC2C4949F
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x9570ABE5
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x367F41DD

0xC2C4949F
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x48F24690
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0x0A8EB35A
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x06A1BE03
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xE6DE29E9
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xCED859E6
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x330AF0F6

0xC2C4949F
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xC66604EC
get down."
0x9F1DF2E6

0xC2C4949F
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x9D66EDCA
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x4B0EE3FC
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xB6463A4B
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x0FBB1B63
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x9643014E

0xC2C4949F
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x2A8E7C19
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0xABDADDD0

0xC2C4949F
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0x4463B069
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xEE430598
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xA4209410

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0x7A7FFCEA
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0x87936EC0

0xC2C4949F
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x37026358

0xC2C4949F
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0xEE3443FC

0xC2C4949F
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0x7DF087E9
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0xBCDD1D29
as a long, strong arm.
0x02E39548

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xC4FE0B32
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x97A4B0EA

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Jane."
0x88CF7314

0xC2C4949F
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x11EE06C2
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0xDB0347FD

0xC2C4949F
"It is near midnight," I said.
0xAB348CD8

0xC2C4949F
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x0936F198
my wedding."
0x78C2BAEA

0xC2C4949F
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xCE9FBCB2
no wish to go to bed."
0x6E25F65B

0xC2C4949F
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x4F196156

0xC2C4949F
"All, sir."
0xFC4E3861

0xC2C4949F
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xDCD45312
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x1A33FDCC
from church."
0x7B164A66

0xC2C4949F
"Very well, sir."
0x0FEC500F

0xC2C4949F
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xEECCB8A8
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0xC855737D
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0x76DFCEE1

0xC2C4949F
"I believe I am."
0x26B2F437

0xC2C4949F
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x8D645201

0xC2C4949F
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xB0251EA9
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0x8BCA4C4A
charged?"
0xBD56A8EE

0xC2C4949F
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0xD1E214BC
over-fatigued."
0x58846331

0xC2C4949F
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xE5F55CA4

0xC2C4949F
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x2F00C167

0xC2C4949F
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xFA5543EA
and flushed.
0x39B8F4D9

0xC2C4949F
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0x17FC9939
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xB1571506
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0xDC5B58CE

0xC2C4949F
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x42769DB4

0xC2C4949F
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x8D537597
new life into which you are passing?"
0xF20354B2

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0x61403287
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0xC584DE1C

0xC2C4949F
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x59C957E3

0xC2C4949F
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0xAA2E6BD2
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xC4AB961F
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x5438E586
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0xD7E6F10D
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0x349D27E3

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0xD50CA420
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0x5FE8AF0E
proceeded.
0x29AACEB3

0xC2C4949F
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0xEFD5B321
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x1591DD68
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0xDA9120B4
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xE1D9241C
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x38C224E5
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0xC6E02767
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x7961C9B5
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0xFC679C35
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0x26C24EB7
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x7F764B34
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x169F8CF8
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x4716E755
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x672187D3
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0x60760643
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x370B1FBB
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x3F4341A3
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0x5B849A19
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x5309F332
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x7819104A
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0xD7C127B0
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x8979C635
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0xD19CC801
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x1DA8E403
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0xCAD17631
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x894F9968
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x1329A7B4
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0xEEDC0DBF
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0x2425A9CB
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x3242EE42
coronet."
0x9D0A9C5B

0xC2C4949F
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0x2B9DF25E
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0xA0B973D2
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x190D7B02

0xC2C4949F
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x6DE8D5D0
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0xB4783177
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x666D96C6
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x89C99FF0
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0xB4867AF5
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x6867B9AF
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x59B0E009
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0xA018B3CE
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x22FEAAD3
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xE648E76A
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0xF9610999
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xFCFEBE85
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x8211B2F6
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0xF766C1B1
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x804F4565
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xCB3908D9
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x44795714
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0xB47CF5FA
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x211EF257
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0x97008A7E
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x36A6B56E
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x098DF2C5
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0xCBA7424B
moment."
0x7D775797

0xC2C4949F
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0x829949F6
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x0459DD1A
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xD30103FB
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0x56583FF1
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xCDCA9E6E
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x471E1DB8
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0xA7F3693F
Jane?--repeat it."
0x70A3A9F3

0xC2C4949F
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0xA89BC05C

0xC2C4949F
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0xAAA63179
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0xAE44D1B5
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xB675839D
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x2AF59025
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x3C9CAD9D
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x281BF823
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0xECFEE7B7
incensed than saddened."
0xC56286A7

0xC2C4949F
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xEBAB4266
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0xD21D471F

0xC2C4949F
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0xBBEC7716
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x395936BE

0xC2C4949F
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0xCE4B4EA7
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0x2B16C47F

0xC2C4949F
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x3DD298C2
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0xEAC7B5E1

0xC2C4949F
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x9F596F18
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0xCE46728E
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x0CC5B68C
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0xB27F1659
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x929B9B05
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x3C3122E5
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x0003203B
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x4E64D3AB
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x6F20FF94
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0x78712176
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0x95215B88
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x623C665E
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0xA809C58F
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0xD59273D4
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0xB54AFF2B
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x2D333DD7
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0xFAF2A483
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0x72F63D9B
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0xB2038BAD
woke."
0x2AEA499E

0xC2C4949F
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x78C4EBD5

0xC2C4949F
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x1B4FA237
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0x577492B7
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x783CC815
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x97E28C75
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0xF353F17D
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x0A261539
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0xB8C0A66D
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x3C537169
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x3ABD5ECF
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x9987ACFB
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0xE921C705
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x1DE00B66
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0x7512D1A3

0xC2C4949F
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xF33BBAD1

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x990E12F0
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0xCFACC17D
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0x72C79814

0xC2C4949F
"Describe it, Jane."
0xCE08746A

0xC2C4949F
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0x0353C5AF
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x53576665
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0xB40DBF0C

0xC2C4949F
"Did you see her face?"
0x0D9F5D24

0xC2C4949F
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0xC6F5F2AB
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xD4D0FA05
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0xDD75CDB5
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0xE8490556

0xC2C4949F
"And how were they?"
0x5C97F60B

0xC2C4949F
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0xE7FB47E1
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x1FD3C4CC
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0x91114F9E

0xC2C4949F
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0xA87F6505

0xC2C4949F
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x4EF06B67
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0x3B311F77
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0xF8A57CCF

0xC2C4949F
"You may."
0x6E9B65A8

0xC2C4949F
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0x6F05EDBE

0xC2C4949F
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0x950FBAD8

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x11A57BCC
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0x7764DE50

0xC2C4949F
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x1EE245DF
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0xADDC162F

0xC2C4949F
"Afterwards?"
0xB24595EA

0xC2C4949F
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0xE99428B6
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x5F462D7E
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xE5596ADE
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x3974F34B
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xB4C9F8DA
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x27C7CF26
from terror."
0xFAD3CE43

0xC2C4949F
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0xE68E5C33

0xC2C4949F
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0xA6387140
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0x16C9736B
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0x0B2BDA08
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0x4131BE1C

0xC2C4949F
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x0D78AEC7
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x4636EDB5
handling."
0xFBE7D9DC

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0x032DD707
transaction actually took place."
0x49028B3B

0xC2C4949F
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0xCBCD6F92
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x0E194221
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0xBAFECCEF

0xC2C4949F
"Not yet."
0x573AE47F

0xC2C4949F
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0x14BA4820
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0x11951AE7
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x15198CC1

0xC2C4949F
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x44295238
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0x32DFD044
mystery of that awful visitant."
0xB1EC99D2

0xC2C4949F
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0xFE9245A7

0xC2C4949F
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xBE89F705
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0xC3DF31C6
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0xA42B9E26
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x7CC658B2
to bottom in two halves!"
0xFAD4EB87

0xC2C4949F
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0xDBEE2035
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x719C2A4C
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x15DD5EDD
might have happened!"
0x72C8F15A

0xC2C4949F
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0xEFBACB75
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0xD369CCA6

0xC2C4949F
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x9AFD4C9A
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0xD5DA3D9E
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0x3F56143C
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0x9182694A
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x3C45D4DE
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0xF1A0FCB5
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x26A3C463
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x0CF57C79
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0xE73E0FDD
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x1EDF8FA5
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x973533FB
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x8AA35DA3
solution of the mystery?"
0x37615688

0xC2C4949F
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xF27917D0
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0xF1E5BD55
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0xE6167948
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x93A8CD74

0xC2C4949F
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x17A5C5A1
candle.
0x575414D0

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x6C0C451E
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xD3DF825E
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0xCDD902D4
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0xA9287133

0xC2C4949F
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x30796414

0xC2C4949F
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x23A5DFD3
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0xFB25AD5D
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xC599674F
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0x20DEFB22
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0xD7B03FA9
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0xC53259C9
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x7782E343

0xC2C4949F
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x1F74C432
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0xE4C464BF
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0xFE645065

0xC2C4949F
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x2260B257
Janet now?"
0x1240E5C6

0xC2C4949F
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x54DD1AFD

0xC2C4949F
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xD0D34387
love and blissful union."
0xDD770923

0xC2C4949F
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0xC9FCA80D
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xCF8DE712
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x3AE1B040
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0xFB22672F
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x1B5B36A1
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0xA9C45B37
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x569A1516
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x85B613F8
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0xD6A3779D
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0x5AA71E45
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0x3075395F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0x759D8F1E
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0x0022EFCB
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0x5570EAC5
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x61D1DCC6
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0xB9CB40A6

0xC2C4949F
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x04FBA418
not taken one peep."
0xA9FDD0C9

0xC2C4949F
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0xA6F682CA
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0x01F7A45A
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0x5DC3051A
by Mr. Rochester.
0x1E5A3493

0xC2C4949F
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x825DBEB0
so long!"
0x7D3B1F00

0xC2C4949F
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0xF7B73B07
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x53DE4F28
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x178A42D2
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x7DA8BEB8
footman, answered it.
0x771A46C5

0xC2C4949F
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0x74F997D3

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0xFED75E3D

0xC2C4949F
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x9828DDF6

0xC2C4949F
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x0C188934
there: return and tell me."
0x143A42BC

0xC2C4949F
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0x37B34C49
footman soon returned.
0xD2782E18

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0x63ECB48B

0xC2C4949F
"And the carriage?"
0xFF17FEE3

0xC2C4949F
"The horses are harnessing."
0x7581252B

0xC2C4949F
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0xD0B71275
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0x349873E7
coachman in his seat."
0xECD3EDA5

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x95AEBF9A

0xC2C4949F
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x435A102B
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x4E36121E
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0xCC08BC85
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0xBD59D4F5
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x80D7D0B0
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xEA5E1867
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x4F8F7451
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x4DC2A80E
and flashing eyes.
0xEAFA6390

0xC2C4949F
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x50FD8DC1
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0x589ECDE8
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x6AB6716E
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x1C7423AA
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0x60570771
seemed breasting and resisting.
0xCDF17896

0xC2C4949F
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0xAE52667E
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x94ACE596
me, Jane."
0x0ABF21B6

0xC2C4949F
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xC1692BAF
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0xB920BD98
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x98500257
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0xD4D11A8B
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x9D2D7750
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0x2952E9FD
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x4CAC8E7D
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x326699B5
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x46334407
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0xA9DA9658
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x72EDC4E0
path to the porch.
0x855086A9

0xC2C4949F
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0xE25DED60
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x68384263
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x2535F958
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x8FE6EDE8
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x95C1D7B1
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x86BC09A0
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x48CD3A28
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0xE3EE5DF9

0xC2C4949F
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x270544CE
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0xA4C7E3FB
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0xDDA137A2
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0xDFED8B4B
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0xB81A27D3
Rochester, went on.
0x21D5E711

0xC2C4949F
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x7C3EACDF
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x5590C004
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0xA0682180
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0xB3A13A57
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x355B34C6
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x16278936

0xC2C4949F
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0x229C866A
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x9A280E29
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x10FB37FD
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x0DA7BEE8
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0xF92D1D55
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x131C32DF

0xC2C4949F
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xAE5749D7

0xC2C4949F
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0xA616DDA1
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x98E46897
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0xF1DEC2D6
said, "Proceed."
0xD734ADBD

0xC2C4949F
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x3DBC04CA
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0x2807247B

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0xD1A3C4AE
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x26DFCA8E

0xC2C4949F
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x2A7167CC
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0xD5D587BD
marriage exists."
0x8AD9FBDD

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0xDAE462B5
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x6A0BFD1E
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x13E0F99A
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0xDBDB224A
beneath!
0xD5952622

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x9F4A3A1F
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x3B2B1800

0xC2C4949F
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x90D0C50D
advisedly."
0xE9D2492B

0xC2C4949F
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x383DC382
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x93FC7AD6

0xC2C4949F
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0x9025E42F
Rochester has a wife now living."
0xED516144

0xC2C4949F
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xB1A78B99
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0x8815C5E4
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xCA7F30E3
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0xF26063FE
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0xE914576D
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xD9071A71
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x054F182A
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x7C4D19C6

0xC2C4949F
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xFFC5C264

0xC2C4949F
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0xBBE584EB

0xC2C4949F
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x975F1817

0xC2C4949F
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x745915F0
recognises, if you do not."
0x971349DF

0xC2C4949F
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x4B141FF3
place of abode."
0x4821F18D

0xC2C4949F
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xE2EC2AE9
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x443D08FE

0xC2C4949F
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xFB80EA17
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0xB6404EA0
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x43C1DB0D
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0xB251DD3B
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0x32D197F1
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0xC46F6057
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0xB41A99B5
Mason.'"
0x65EB74CA

0xC2C4949F
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x50A85B0F
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0xB36EC4D4

0xC2C4949F
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0xD0DAB781

0xC2C4949F
"How do you know?"
0x0C01BB1D

0xC2C4949F
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x6BC43082
scarcely controvert."
0x963B9994

0xC2C4949F
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0xD339ACE5

0xC2C4949F
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x024047B0
goodness to step forward."
0xC431DFEF

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x460B4A20
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xAEB22DB8
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0xD939303F
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x44D0A549
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x51489904
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0xD17E2B4C
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0xA016F767
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0xC47F5615
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x6AFE06B1
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x85A692D7
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0xAFE15533
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0xAB530317
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x3390BFEB
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xB58F36FE

0xC2C4949F
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0xC36695FE

0xC2C4949F
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0xFEAC652A
what have you to say?"
0xB23BC452

0xC2C4949F
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x1342BCF1
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x9D327E82
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x0F32C1EA

0xC2C4949F
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x82D4824F

0xC2C4949F
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x0CB6EB2E
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0xCD7B1F8A

0xC2C4949F
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x100CE292
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x99C7497D
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x71F3CB71

0xC2C4949F
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0xD0EF527C

0xC2C4949F
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x4F27055E
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0xF3054D5C
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0xEDD520D3

0xC2C4949F
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0x583A2AB7
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0x47E3EDEB
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x5635F0DE
obeyed.
0x09751A4D

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x241A363F
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x14CAA657
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x76D15025
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0xAE267FD0
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xDFE70DEE
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x010D70FE
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0xF74F6E6D
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0x4714D5FA
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x2A68EA67
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x5DB5A847
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x79FBCE65
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xD400090C
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0xBB5292C7
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x0205D566
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x14A1C43E
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x0C92B5B2
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x18F61103
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x9459055B
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x4DC07F4E
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x0F51135E
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0x1A3EF691
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0xD84ABB09
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x9D242C78
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x5EF7A73C
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x1F89768D
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0x9921AC26
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x9BCC5D39
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x3148C8B8
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x5CBC00EA
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0xA547CA33
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x0313D07C
you--follow!"
0x8B2CAFF8

0xC2C4949F
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x718DB047
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x86C14D2D

0xC2C4949F
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0xCEF78F57
will not be wanted to-day."
0x2C90D861

0xC2C4949F
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0xF241FFB0
greet us.
0x115F8A8E

0xC2C4949F
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x0E7FC0D9
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0xFAF106AF
late!"
0xEC036EBE

0xC2C4949F
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x34B30E84
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x069980CE
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0xCE315EC7
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0x4BB4A8E5
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0xA988F215

0xC2C4949F
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0x9844DAB3
here."
0xCE1D4470

0xC2C4949F
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x64C1DFEF
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0x4717003D
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x5927DD05
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x01E4E2EF
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x1B2793C6
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0xA139683C
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0xC0E504E5
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0x88C09D04
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x423F198B
mane, hid its head and face.
0x3F59B827

0xC2C4949F
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0xA4A146C0
your charge to-day?"
0xEDCE0BF7

0xC2C4949F
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x546B9FEF
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x96B944DF

0xC2C4949F
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x9B0EC850
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x4E0A7EF1

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0xE76A9AF5

0xC2C4949F
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x7542CAA2

0xC2C4949F
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x261FB928

0xC2C4949F
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0xECBA247D
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x0B61BB5D
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x1D46B085

0xC2C4949F
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xC4601734
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x0AE6C30E

0xC2C4949F
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0xE0833C51
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0xBC7BC66C

0xC2C4949F
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0xDC0B2338

0xC2C4949F
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0xEA1A215C

0xC2C4949F
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x5F9D1B86
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x583D87D9
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xAB99CAB6
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0x2CA86838
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x6BDEBC5E
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xDFA1EED7
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0xC012BE1C
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x823080ED
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x7082CE9C
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0xAA67F9F6
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x040BF003
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0xEE7527D4

0xC2C4949F
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0x71BEB1B0
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0xC59C23ED
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x26D8420A
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x7D247EC2
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x86AC82D8
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xB77945E6
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x7BBEE7B5
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x0CC0CA9F
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x8C099F38
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x0F54C356

0xC2C4949F
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xC2AB0511
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0xED9CE13B
the stair.
0x0493B184

0xC2C4949F
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0xEF9F7E57
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x1A619233
returns to Madeira."
0x4892F0D1

0xC2C4949F
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x770E4B75

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xBB55E65A
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xFE8221D7
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x5DDE3CDB
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x7C9AF017
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0xEFA18CE1
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x62336B94
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0xC206B24F
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x3AAE2CF0
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x574419BD
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xCA436AD3
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x670B1969
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x6C8191ED
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x9AA6EB41
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0xF70D1337
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x70D69361
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0xC44DF18E
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x5F2C6F26
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0x43E8CFDE
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xB8428A2A

0xC2C4949F
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xE0A63A69
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0xC579B077
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xEE6DF9DC
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x9F33E432

0xC2C4949F
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x4BFC2B95
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0xD9EFD8FF
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x7774D502
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0x43630CC5
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x32EBAB43
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x84267E95
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x0A2141D5
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x28280D65
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0xADC80524
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0x59C48B7C

0xC2C4949F
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x533EB762
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x6349848F
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0x2BA91B97
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0xE342F2D3
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x63FAD608
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0x048C5C96
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x7CB599E3
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0xAD9CE393

0xC2C4949F
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x760A15FB
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x8EF5CAC5
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xF45A4A1C
prospects?
0xF42B7A6D

0xC2C4949F
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0xDA131AA8
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x51C9227B
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x37565167
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0xE9C3A73F
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0xB6E5D8DF
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x97191929
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0x9A5BB52A
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0xD2BB96F4
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xC4F2E1CB
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0xC87F4B75
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x100D0438
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0xAFF611D4
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0x978AA6DB
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x170D3EE1
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x47786DA1
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x78B46370
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x90ED08D4
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x0AB67C29
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x187A63EB
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x4C15AE80
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0xAD9B0A02
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x1D5728C2
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x059D07CF
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0xA4AA7899
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x74F0E48D
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x055E5235
conduct!
0x03BF839C

0xC2C4949F
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0x8D44264F
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x2FA8FBD4
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x59331ACA
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0xD084FDF2
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x43497037
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0x046B7FBD
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x60560C45
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0x8FC9567E
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x75ACD485

0xC2C4949F
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x4B83878D

0xC2C4949F
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0xF2F544A0
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x0C4A4359
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x1D2594AF
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0xF2897CC8
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0xC195514B
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x5BC07FC1
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0x25E6CBF0
floods overflowed me."
0xE55D8681

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXVII
0xF530D5C0

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x1648755C
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x1916FE99
"What am I to do?"
0x2D5868F6

0xC2C4949F
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0x342429E2
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0xEDA96E58
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x97C748CF
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x786BDDBD
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x187938C9
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0xE31D9E8D
cannot do it."
0x0923C8A4

0xC2C4949F
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x89A6D662
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x7CB45933
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xC3083893
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x71BD157A
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x963E69FB
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x93AAB5D6
depths of agony.
0x1A9BBBB2

0xC2C4949F
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0xB4BB6B47

0xC2C4949F
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x88418306
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0xF5E70649
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x89297D6E

0xC2C4949F
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x0140B5D1
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x028D7112
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0x1461B720
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x65ED4076
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x2E84D207
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0xC6DB8639
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x1745AE9D
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x7F90A21D
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x0150B7A1
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x5384564B
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0xDAD8A876
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0x1DEA77EC
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0x2ADEE511
threshold.
0x1CA49F5D

0xC2C4949F
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0xF9EE0680
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xD810F7C2
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x4D08D407
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0x0FF63193
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0xE42108D9
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x24BF16FE
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0xF165295D
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0xE3FF18EA
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x5CF29C11
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x095B4AB8

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x6678E9C2
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x1807712D
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x1F35FFC4

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0xA84603B7
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0xD21D976D
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x20C81697
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xD8D2C777
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x6F526CBA

0xC2C4949F
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0xCA3706BD
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x128354B3
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0xFCBA0F8E
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0x3791D09F
heart's core.
0x42B888E6

0xC2C4949F
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x246E644C
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0xAAEA1496
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0xE6423E53

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xF0DA7A36

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xEA09DA50
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x7CEA18C3
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x133394BC
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0xC6C079B6
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x0EAAD6FF
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0xB0FF9D66
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0xB05996B4
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x748135AB
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0xFD657FF2
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0xC738E343
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x2BE81DA7
him."
0x10103776

0xC2C4949F
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x6C82C8DE

0xC2C4949F
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x5D25C7F9

0xC2C4949F
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x9689DD0A

0xC2C4949F
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x38BB15E3
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0x59D84A5A
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0xE49E4BE9
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x7EDA4C15
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xDFE32647
put his aside.
0xA7FEE7CC

0xC2C4949F
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x9B2EEB21
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x5CE1B333
appropriated?"
0xB81E1A16

0xC2C4949F
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x4ADCCBE0

0xC2C4949F
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0xEC0A2734
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x6C77CC5E
rightly?"
0x2FD43874

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0xFE0F764C
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0xE55995FD
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0x45CE9EFC
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x266DD347
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x6A218D17
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0xF73AA051
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x2E583B5D
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x17668EA2
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0xBCBB2B58
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x6E53540E
know you--I am on my guard."
0x14BFB706

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0xD58E19C7
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0xBA0A34C0

0xC2C4949F
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0xA5CB90C6
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0x12C1ECFD
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0xED2B10FF
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0xD4E2CA75
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x3A645AC4
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x05F89FBB
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x35A3957A
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x0F392EC6

0xC2C4949F
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x985F0ED6
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x8315CFCF
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x49D75720
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0xE0597A92

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0xD9E29D4A
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x2DB47623
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0xE149897C
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0x60C22731
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xFAA9BD56
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xF5F77C80
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x774D44F4
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x0068BBC2
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0x1656AD45
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xFC67495C
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0xB9480419
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0xF7900A2A
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x97C774D1
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x50A20D76
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x56A555A8
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0xB6A30B27
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x67DD07DC
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0x91A91C62

0xC2C4949F
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0xC0DFCF33
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x0F3E6B75
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0xD494A216
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0xBD9B50F3
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0x4A10A53D
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0xCBD4F006
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0xEE6314B1
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0x9DF54B59
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x3DFE6433
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x20D8DF20

0xC2C4949F
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0x1630A189
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0x55218C6C
cannot help being mad."
0x569B9CED

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0xB9D596ED
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0xC5BE6FE3
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x34006251

0xC2C4949F
"I do indeed, sir."
0x4F12C352

0xC2C4949F
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xECCE1BE5
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x0BFEB85B
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x46E1D4E6
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0xD7C5B38A
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xC8E95FB8
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x8D8180A5
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xDFF1341E
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0xED3977FF
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x41C72EB2
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0xFF74E534
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x50A01D96
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0xCBA1835C
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0xCD3D0F57
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0xF847B2EC
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x45056CEA
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0x87B18A41
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x8B182281
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0xEED3AFF0
falsehood and slander."
0xEFB1B88A

0xC2C4949F
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xFA498DE2
for you."
0x15F1BAC6

0xC2C4949F
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0xF8407748
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x6F7A7E7C
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xD96D394F
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xC09D47AA

0xC2C4949F
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x8993FDCB
too dull for you."
0x6F61DBBA

0xC2C4949F
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0x92B13129
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x7105B366
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0x9B451510

0xC2C4949F
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x95EBB854
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xAF1142FB
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0x51E27119
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x5981218F
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xF2901776

0xC2C4949F
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0xD8845394
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x2F36411A
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x75416E8B
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xB1152C65
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0xB92B4BFA
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0x3B0CCB3C

0xC2C4949F
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x4F357654
before me.
0x487876A9

0xC2C4949F
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xE42F4C7B
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x7D2F4700
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x9F8984C2
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x76766726
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0xAD99C6D3
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0xA88EA525
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xF0E9EDD6
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x63139839
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0x7A7D85C5
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0xEAA4A7F2
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x992F1840
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x7032166C
soothingly--
0x5D617D06

0xC2C4949F
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x1252464C
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x7BF75B8C

0xC2C4949F
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x82F608ED
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0xE4692B32
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0xA464F61C
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x1CC31F6C
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x99BAD197
heartily.
0xE5C51B20

0xC2C4949F
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x54F4AE12
not while he was in such a passion.
0x6E9E6C90

0xC2C4949F
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0xCD22D718
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0xB96ADDEE
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0xF0D35BF7

0xC2C4949F
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x075D96D1
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0x5937745E
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x3B19F172

0xC2C4949F
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xD08E7B7C
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0xF081DD9C
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0xA579F8D6
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x3C87BFAE
were some toad or ape."
0x306233BA

0xC2C4949F
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0xF56B567C
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x33C132A6
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x5222BD61
where I had wounded.
0x60C02618

0xC2C4949F
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x623BA08B
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0xBE74F411

0xC2C4949F
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0xC978C39C
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0x224DD85C

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0xD6974FB0
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0xF0CD32E1

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x046E3DFC

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0x65D013A4

0xC2C4949F
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0x2F77EF1E
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x087A6459

0xC2C4949F
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0x52C68B48
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x7D36F2FF
scenes."
0x0279E899

0xC2C4949F
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0xDAA18495
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x6490A48D
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0x2E799E72
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0xDDA5A119
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x15E5D68B
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0x824A7F02
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0x4823899E
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x4E54A1E5
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x6606FFEE
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x133E1174

0xC2C4949F
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0x81B6771C
still I dared to speak.
0xB95FEE93

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x4E733176
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0xBD50BC7F
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x638BFAEE

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x607518D2
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xAB9E0F80
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0xDA3B306A

0xC2C4949F
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xBCD6B7D6
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x2BB5B76E
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x0D196A5C
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0xD06F64FD
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x46FDE9F7
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0xE3F84023

0xC2C4949F
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0x3050E6E9
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0x30B64151
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0x369CBE67
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0xB4182624
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0x8A22A78B
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x79136417
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0x132321D5
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0x11F3BF6E

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xE8A031AA

0xC2C4949F
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x9BD43212
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0xC1D9AD2C

0xC2C4949F
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0xB994D263

0xC2C4949F
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0x9583AA72

0xC2C4949F
"I have understood something to that effect."
0xAD13A390

0xC2C4949F
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x86BD1F46
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0x73DFE738
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x23580FE8
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x3DCA8D11
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x8C4F511D
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0xDA9A593E
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x6F20F780
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x6312E9EC
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0xCA5AE229
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0x6324D8BD
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0xCAAA7683
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0x7321A86B
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x96779199
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x64CA2374
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x3A1AF019
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0x2E4895E1
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x9BBE82E8
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xCF339C7F
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0xC638C515
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x8D45C0C4
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x544C5990
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0xA42F420B
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xDDA979CB
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0x7267A9D7
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x3321F9AC
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0xEDDAE93F
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x2DB0DF91
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0xDA58FDED
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x925CFECA
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x070C7692
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x07DA5A11
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x33A7D68E

0xC2C4949F
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x06A10F8D
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0x931DE595
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0x1A62E1B4
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0xDF0C866D
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0x1617D786
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0xAC855159
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x762A2488
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x68935483
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0xF33AEC2A
plot against me."
0xAB7D9191

0xC2C4949F
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0x42A15B00
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0xAB975B33
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xB8E17D8F
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0x0C7B5977
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0x6CD61767
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0x9164F971
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0xB3A849AD
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x29B1FA2B
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x1A7884C8
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0xEBB0E8E2
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0x412F4F0A
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x5C2A03FD
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0xA19B9B71
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x0CCA65F5
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0x2E2C3249

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x66CB0124
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x37A9560D
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x6DBACD53
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0xDB1AE03A
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x3C536EA3
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0x77A9D91F
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x87DF8D27
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0xF60BC4AD
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x3CDFDF37
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0x9D830175

0xC2C4949F
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0x69890F6A
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0xFBF8B65C
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x810DE549
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0x1FB2573C
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0xFC229C30
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x478DAC27
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0x3F333953
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0x79B19632

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xB8A9E7C6

0xC2C4949F
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0x7F72DA4A
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0xB6058EE0
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0x94D1C34F
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0x96DDE776
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0xDF429944
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0x1B0F609C
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xC1116FFB
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0xE5DE55D0
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0xC36767CE
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x697F1CBE
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0x4324950C

0xC2C4949F
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"

"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0x9BF3DA32
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0xA3E567A5
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x9E92B321
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x72E5985E
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x3EF05D24
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0xEF7D7748
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x71B07189
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0xD120070C
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0xED53AA00
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x79292E4F
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xA30CECEB
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x96C0034E
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0xE6DA2AD1
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0x6961E7ED

0xC2C4949F
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x23AB6880
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0xACF40FBC
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0x115AA3FA
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0x9A04DA90
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x5CCA1CC1
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0xA95EB449
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0x71AAD7C4
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x3ED0FF33
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0xB4A2CF59
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0xD26EEAB4
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x6C730052
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0x4BE6E6F2
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xE0CBF766
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xA7FDCC8E
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x1A449EBE
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

0xC2C4949F
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0x21CB182A
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0x25BCF30E
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0xC5DB51C4
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0xC3534ECC
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x4BDEBBF8
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0x89BF2B42

0xC2C4949F
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0xF5E2AD20
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0xA3223594
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0xB1B656D6
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0x715F6938
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0xED93817F

0xC2C4949F
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0x07E7E532
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0x9872467A
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0xC6868C7A
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0x25E3522D
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0x6EC7DE39
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0xD35C725A
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0x7546B930
follow.
0x7050287F

0xC2C4949F
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0x8749F4EC
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x85FC671A
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0xACFC83A6
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0x8AD3AC13
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0xC5CFCB71
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0x341F3A32
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0xCFDE6774

0xC2C4949F
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0x5495070C
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0xA444638C
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0x1F9E73A2
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0x6032D163
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0x82899DB5
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0xEAECC070
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0x1484827A
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0xE490F237
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0x945427AD
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0xE151C851
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0x298B30BC
and leave her.'
0x2E6E257C

0xC2C4949F
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0x70C6A95E
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0xE1828720
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0xFCF18843
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0x0CEE0A54
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x6A2D3481
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0xE39916FB
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x9B0111AE
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0x2F4AFEC5
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0x41AE201F

0xC2C4949F
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0x14C89F9B
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0x5B9CE137
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0x6D0CFD35
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0xCAA666DE
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0x738E66A6
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x82449CC6
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x10A4EF6C
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0xB4A858D2
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0x87F5971B
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0x1868B113
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x742B2FD3
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0xBC6DC098
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0x6A5C2281
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0xFCC9D12E
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x894DECDC
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x71386A5C
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0xE21ADB03
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x092BAB1D
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x07D34A05
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0xFAAFCD1E
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0xC773C87F
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x39390927
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x0A6F3676
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x036E82AC
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x1490F133
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0xF4A408A4
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0x555D915C

0xC2C4949F
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xB9F8EA9C
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0x0697058F

0xC2C4949F
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0xF46A8B98
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0xFE7B9510
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0xAE590DC8
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x69AF007A
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0xADA3B363

0xC2C4949F
"But you could not marry, sir."
0xDF9EF6F1

0xC2C4949F
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0x017E085B
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0x96AC78F9
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x81DA49D0
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0x136F53ED
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0x6ACEF1D6
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x94B9D293
burdened."
0xE412FD11

0xC2C4949F
"Well, sir?"
0xA327419F

0xC2C4949F
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0xBE89C016
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0xE2C51716
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x0CB3038E
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0xF842E9B2
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0xBD214894
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0x52466C15
don't very well know why."
0x7D282AB9

0xC2C4949F
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0xD401864E

0xC2C4949F
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0x17E98F72

0xC2C4949F
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0xC3E5A2A9
and what she said."
0x8380EDED

0xC2C4949F
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0xEB168FE0
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0x14EF4E57
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x7D631681
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0xA215E8AF
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x4293165E
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0xD931558A
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0xFC779DEA
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xBBD701E7
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x80756B6D
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x7297C097
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0xF4913145
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x87D6149C
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x4BD13072
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x04D0F849
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0xDADF2568
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0x51474EAB
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0xEAA020D5
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0x1A0501DD
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0xE1DB5CA8
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0x0C22177F

0xC2C4949F
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0x1C3DA33C
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0x84812E23
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0x5699040D
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x37937395
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0xBCB7A7B1
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0xF233B9C1
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x65A209CC
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x1AE779F6
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x4667E96B
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x908B47D4
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x8C4E7F48
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0x69710D87

0xC2C4949F
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x332F9F15
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x841A15FD
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0xE72EBE6F

0xC2C4949F
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0x4D3CF1E5
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0xAC808B61
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0x9C2AC228
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x9B16BB67
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0x705F47FC
Giacinta, and Clara."
0x3E504967

0xC2C4949F
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x03418F73
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0xF3F9E706
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x00EB8C65
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0xFDBE89F5
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0xA4F03CEC
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xFC19CC30
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0xF1C66AA9
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x46E47683

0xC2C4949F
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0x9563358A
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x9B81A817
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0xC7D5B2AF
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x3625BCAE
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0x599373BD
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0xCA4277A3
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0xD01BB4E1
back to England.
0xC641EA16

0xC2C4949F
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0xFC8EBDDF
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0x0DF16EE5
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xD2FA8B23
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x98B08F07
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x494AD8CC
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x3FA90BA0
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0xCF74DBEC
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x57B98D56
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x53B27349
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x847D38A1
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0x285E26DF
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x434F1CE8

0xC2C4949F
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x0B24A399
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0x6DE5332C
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xF2A6F9FA
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0xDFAE97B4
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0xEC1B4201
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x55A1C8E3
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x1F52B37E
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xA9522958
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x17A9B6AC
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0xE71F75ED
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0xE3F62876
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x05245FAB
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x356AE7BE
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x6D5D680A
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x292CDB08
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0x1D0EF68D
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0x612FEF52
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x5D36C4C0
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x41154B8B
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0xC40D31CD
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0xDAE255E7
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0x44429665
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x5E4FA4FA
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0x448D2122
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x4A1EF3B0
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0xEB5D3C52
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x5322C5EF
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0xC0711318
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x06EE659B
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0xF2C2286A
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xF71EE798
out of my sight.
0x8D34194C

0xC2C4949F
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xD9DDB511
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x3275F880
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x1D40F2A1
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0xE5B3BEC9
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0xE699A6B6
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0x88B8D9B5
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x43C084B5
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x0ABD67FB
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x2A4159E8
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0xFA42180F
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x48615E9F
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xE9D93CCB
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0xC8C4FA56
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x5532B188
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xF28F9FAD
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0x70E92BA6
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0xCAA63F6D
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x19C12E21
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x07B73A77
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x42504094
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xC37A81A8
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x4ACC88E0
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xC9481EDA
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xBA48280A
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0xCDB9DF36
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x721AA9C8
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0xA95A9C51
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x0EA919B9
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0xD4623B5C
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x3F9158F9
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xE50936CC
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x45CA6EAF
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xCC71DB87
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x5D81AA89

0xC2C4949F
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x4A7BA495
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x75C89B5B
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0xD25C4DAC
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0xDDCC1229
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x3A680AAA
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0xBF4B4F44
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0x3C54DBAD
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0xAD7E9889
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x86A8E3D3
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0xEB6786EB
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x4819EFD7
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x4560F5AA
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x24D6B1DC
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0xADC7811C

0xC2C4949F
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x88AEFE8C
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0x0C5C2880
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xA759539A
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0x9868FE1D

0xC2C4949F
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x48B6F7E5
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0x71BCAA23

0xC2C4949F
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0x821D2219

0xC2C4949F
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x1125D8B2
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x1E5DAAA1
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0xBF0EFA85
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0xBD46E480
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x53D36D79
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xB9943441
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x68164979
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0xAB24F4E2

0xC2C4949F
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xECB2ABCE
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0xC94C628C
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x3C48341B
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0xE09546CA
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x4490BE32
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x78C3E935
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x76DADAF9
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x29ABE148
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x9BD91481
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x87C0D5E3
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x92C9D8CC
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x567925E4

0xC2C4949F
A pause.
0x05962448

0xC2C4949F
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x54BE0139

0xC2C4949F
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x3A347E34
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0x08A0727C
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0xA99422F8
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x213EDC41
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0xADDF43AD

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x48B4B2A6
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0x1308257D

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0xAEA19BC5

0xC2C4949F
Another long silence.
0x6AEFAF31

0xC2C4949F
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0x4FEC5B88
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x5CAA53DC
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x53EC3310
and to let me go another?"
0xDEFB9E4D

0xC2C4949F
"I do."
0x8DA50A73

0xC2C4949F
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0xBDA27E07

0xC2C4949F
"I do."
0x8DA50A73

0xC2C4949F
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0xCAB8B04E

0xC2C4949F
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0xC9726848

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0xFC41ECC5
to love me."
0xD06B46E6

0xC2C4949F
"It would to obey you."
0x7EB8EA0A

0xC2C4949F
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0xB9A28B8A
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x7EFE4EB7
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x93DE54E0

0xC2C4949F
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0x2C6960B2
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0xFBFD16C4
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x4BB4F099
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xC6A9234C
companion and for some hope?"
0x1DD112D2

0xC2C4949F
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x56D38FD8
again there."
0xB63AC4C3

0xC2C4949F
"Then you will not yield?"
0xF7EAFF8C

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0xF866F388
rose.
0xA017756B

0xC2C4949F
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x08AD1A7E

0xC2C4949F
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x927A953A
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x88DC1B65

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x94212C79
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0xB4D194BF
will forget me before I forget you."
0xBF053E35

0xC2C4949F
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x4917B724
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x21A9F268
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0xCA3DABDC
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0xC836A33E
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x845FC8DA
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0x30643EF7
by living with me?"
0x7AFB024C

0xC2C4949F
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0xF0E0DC5F
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0xE5F2D4A4
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0xDE56AA38
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x359D48DB
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x448BA74A
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0xEC14A633
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x059A013D
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x59C8907D

0xC2C4949F
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x7581316C
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x3943588B
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x0D087FDA
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x84652927
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x271A25ED
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x5BD5862F
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0x9F0220E5
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0x9C45FD04
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0xBB72A778
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x3CF0D0BF
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x3251E6A7
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x907FA06D
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0x18298159

0xC2C4949F
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x236B51E8
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x07B1BF8A
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x3DB6E578
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0x81238E2F
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x289756E7
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x9D32BBB9
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0xA4F1CAC4
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0xC25B5FAD
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0xD54D6FB8
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0xBC88E8EB
strength almost exhausted.
0x7AB0CA7E

0xC2C4949F
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0xC66EB01E
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x2AAA990D
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x2A077C73
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0xA0A91F32
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0xDA550F19
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0xFABD8D3D
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0xB13902B3
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x569474A0
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x5160CEB7
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x0C144D43
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x9062A9F2
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0xBEB207F3
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0xF5C5C3CB
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x857C9B85
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x36FEDCA8

0xC2C4949F
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x296A6191
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x8565068F
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0x51E0723C
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x1BA12C04

0xC2C4949F
"You are going, Jane?"
0x7DA5BD04

0xC2C4949F
"I am going, sir."
0x0C0AFBCA

0xC2C4949F
"You are leaving me?"
0x0B0E4186

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x788B988C
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x19780F2A

0xC2C4949F
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x80CB30BC
firmly, "I am going."
0x8169F230

0xC2C4949F
"Jane!"
0x860F3D06

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester!"
0xB6357896

0xC2C4949F
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0xCBDA5133
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0x7DDF5128
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0xA03645EC

0xC2C4949F
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x5C5A0133
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x3C7B317E
deep, strong sob.
0x9A82E215

0xC2C4949F
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0xF7E43270
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x1F7E0DDD
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0x50B260C5
hand.
0xF5279F4E

0xC2C4949F
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0x8057AACF
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0x983C02C4
me."
0x17C56D17

0xC2C4949F
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x6E077013
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0xB82B796F
yes--nobly, generously."
0xEF0FAAA8

0xC2C4949F
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0x8AAE5D39
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x160B0ADA
once quitted the room.
0x8F2CDD51

0xC2C4949F
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0xF7B59CF1
"Farewell for ever!"
0x6B22BDAE

0xC2C4949F
* * * * *
0x1BB6D6B2

0xC2C4949F
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0xB1EDA58B
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x3ECE5354
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x1A2EA0B4
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x6675112A
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0x9AEACA5B
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0xF81022D8
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x84D7BE77
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x332F0923
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0xD177E69F
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x291CD80C
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0x58BA11C4
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0x89ABF08B
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x0A95CF69
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x96FBAB45
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0xD5B4FE44

0xC2C4949F
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0xFD39733F

0xC2C4949F
"Mother, I will."
0xAC03B40C

0xC2C4949F
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0xB3931CD7
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x8A1A171D
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x2AE5C378
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x722B0650
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x3AAAE71C
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x56FFEF7A
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0x5E61E75A
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0xCA5A3CCE
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0x1D389794
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0xE423072B
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x97413710
from my room.
0x07B72C52

0xC2C4949F
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x32CFAFC3
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0xCD1A7E64
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xCDFEC2CC
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0x671FE1EB

0xC2C4949F
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0x5F06875B
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x2D278918
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x0A6F5181
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0xEEE4FB91
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x7085CBAF
to go in and to say--
0x4B6A2486

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x91482946
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x6A38480E
this.
0xCDDE935F

0xC2C4949F
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x92202569
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0xAFF4A5EB
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0xAFF9548D
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0xD91A4DA5
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x71C393B2
on.
0x1B445DB7

0xC2C4949F
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xA8552016
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0x253A7088
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0x89DF72D5
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x155BA7F1
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0xF333CCCC
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x3EF16D9D
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0xA4627EFE
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x6BAD5844
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0xD5FC5DDF

0xC2C4949F
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x27AA4C72
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x922FC5FB
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x819653EC
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x2524D9F6
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x7D5675AD
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0xD434FCA3
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x770716D2
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0xA457C34A

0xC2C4949F
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0x955451DA
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x54AD80D8
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x5DA9A0E6
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0x10A06B02
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0xA404152C
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x97CD7EFD
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x604EDD70
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x7DFDCF29
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0xA558FE3F
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0x8CF0ACFE
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x1360083E
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x78FDA214
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x5097FA72
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x1DEC164E
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0xDBA2D975
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x50F65161
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xAD34A262
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x4B7B7CCC
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0x596DD85C
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0x43B6FBC6
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x43A8EC77
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0xD41C19D0
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xC7B971AB
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x947EB704
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x145D5A15
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x7D24406D
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x10872BA8
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x1C8B2BEC
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0xDE5226BF
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xF02DB765
ever to reach the road.
0x01CF31F6

0xC2C4949F
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x0FFA2B0D
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xAED839DF
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0xE9913143
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0xE27424A2
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0xDADC7725
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0xEA26E0ED
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0xFCBCC9C8
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0xBE4823AA

0xC2C4949F
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x0B32652C
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xD21E3249
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x939F8A48
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xF7EF586F
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0x2666504A

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x377FF166
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0x4011D0C5
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xE43E9703
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x1E6CFB55
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0xD86923E4
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0x172A2BB7
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0xD48647CE

0xC2C4949F
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x945750CB
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xBC6F6964
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x5F3F2469
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0x5B40CEBC
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x2755FADA
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xCC4DBA6A
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0x28C077BD
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xC5BCAD42
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x006A3512
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x5C6F9C1B
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x2A101A10
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0xBFF61E9F
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x44FA0B16
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x4A9EECA1
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x78AB4D44
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x55FA220C
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0xEE1CFFA3
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0xBE0BDFDD
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x28D676A0
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0x99E18609

0xC2C4949F
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0xE4720BC8
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x31547423
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0x2DC4FDB9
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x958EABC3
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0xB3B51EE4

0xC2C4949F
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x21EDAE92
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x28984F5D
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0x4D54DB5A
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xBEDA8935
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x24006F7C
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0xB7A6C562
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0x1FE29CF7
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x2D8AE065

0xC2C4949F
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0xCA55A556
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x988EB762
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x06C01964
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0xE952CD7C
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0x83930CA5
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0xF7058FBA

0xC2C4949F
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0x0D5A667E
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0xE60EE455
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0xC64460CF
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x62969337
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0x4E23D8EF
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x6921A615
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x88823300
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0xE1755D74
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0x0D1A3B31
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0x772CE824
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0x2706E11B
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x6D3D6A80
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0xE23F5300
then chose my couch.
0x2655C013

0xC2C4949F
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x20714446

0xC2C4949F
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x5678B0D3
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x90BD7287
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0xF4B520CB
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0x22F70657
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x0D9B84C6

0xC2C4949F
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0xA3DBFC03
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0x4DAE3659
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0xA34EDC1B
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x5097C923
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0x88BDCD84
attempts to seek him.
0x3BDCE2D8

0xC2C4949F
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0x442D5887
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x4F0399B3
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xC1A375D3
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0xCD8DC23B
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0x73FE94DA
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0x191E8986
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x54B99C39
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0xFF54BAAE
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0xF5639E16
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x96713D6E
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0x15D5F865
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x30781B1A
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0xF1124583
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0xF05CFF67
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x6A2A6645
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x7A84851C

0xC2C4949F
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0x1DD61155
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x3805F803
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0xF6279DC9
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0xEAE055F2
looked round me.
0xFF99220E

0xC2C4949F
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x3F6D4174
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x62E3BFE5
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x290BC8D2
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0xB40731DE
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x29846BEC
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x91BEC54B
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x5DDF6E4E
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0xE43DF05C
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x92A1DF9E
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0x6F5E9F9D
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x4E8E0864
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x42ED8643
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xF37BBCFE
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0xA2DAE3F7
out.
0x55FB1F5A

0xC2C4949F
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0xD392B2AB
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x8804FE1C
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0xEE469CF9
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0x5F2FC14C
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0xE795C07F
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0xF6C913CC
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x6C4E0846

0xC2C4949F
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x88AD864C
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0xE253DD9C
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0xC4AC9A35
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x1421E99B
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0xA296C4A8
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x9897A2B4
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0xA90528F1
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x93123193
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x2313A592
like the rest.
0xB5D7C5DB

0xC2C4949F
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0xC5D29E3A
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0xCF6D62D5
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0xBA5745F1
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x275108F7
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x56028435
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x91AD3FD3
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x80489F18
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0xA1CBA7A2
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x7A6F76D3
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x93F4A8BE
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x2840AC4F
would not; but I must try.
0x7EBC957C

0xC2C4949F
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x7ABE5C16
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x99BD047F
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0xECE361F7
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0xF1F2BD4E
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x913B64C4
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x129154D4
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0xB7E20516
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x2C8FDDCF
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0xB40211C6
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0xCE4255DA
the village?"
0x35952260

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x5BBD51A5

0xC2C4949F
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x6BD86323
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0xE2E92115
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0xEF3EE796
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x47E66D01

0xC2C4949F
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0xDBF819A0
wanted?"
0x84D28FC2

0xC2C4949F
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0xF793A091

0xC2C4949F
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x5B1ECB10
do?"
0x4FB6B21F

0xC2C4949F
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x7C424FA3
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x1F26ACFE

0xC2C4949F
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x3112B1F1

0xC2C4949F
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x30FDF85A

0xC2C4949F
"And what do the women do?"
0xE18C85C2

0xC2C4949F
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x188F6EAB
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0xADC690A4

0xC2C4949F
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x7555AE4F
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xB10F4844
wanted.  I took leave.
0x49370B23

0xC2C4949F
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0xE5EC7368
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x2DACD8A9
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x68B98B96
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0xAD9BFD15
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0x1F556C09
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0xB8A4E1B9
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0xD09D9F16
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x32323F1E
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x7D31DE9E
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x65AE5784
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x38E68D97
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0x1C60EA72
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0xC45471F8
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xBA150C12
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x88B89205
if a servant was wanted here?
0x8D6F9790

0xC2C4949F
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x2DC84FE3

0xC2C4949F
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0x3365AAC2
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xB7BB66B3
no matter what."
0x3F363D3D

0xC2C4949F
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x9B8962C5
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0xD9785427
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0xBB0B0668
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xCFEF4039
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0x3CFFCD10
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x99A26671

0xC2C4949F
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x19670953
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x6558E6C3
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0xD9651545
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xDCF782A8
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x5B7915E5
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0xE3353976
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x619CE79A

0xC2C4949F
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0xFE180F6B
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0xCE9CC1A9
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xF730CB77
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x76E9F0C2
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x01A733CA
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0xC0477C49
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0xED030344
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xBE98D870
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xF4B6867F
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0xCE748649
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x7191865F
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0xD6451154
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xBFF67ACB
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x6380294C
this the parsonage?
0x8A06D049

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Was the clergyman in?"
0xFC7419D5

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"Would he be in soon?"
0x0A2FDC7A

0xC2C4949F
"No, he was gone from home."
0xE18DC579

0xC2C4949F
"To a distance?"
0xC1A83659

0xC2C4949F
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x5D545451
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xEBE227C7
there a fortnight longer."
0x1294BB6A

0xC2C4949F
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x758EE382

0xC2C4949F
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0xBF82813A
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x07CED905
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x752801AA

0xC2C4949F
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0xB38D9C55
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0x0FAA76C6
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x984574B9
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x20CF28B9
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0xF5441C02
for this handkerchief?"
0xC1C3B446

0xC2C4949F
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0x7BCE4E8C
that way."
0xE846516E

0xC2C4949F
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x52DFF2E0
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x7F2FE3DA

0xC2C4949F
"Would she take my gloves?"
0xC1EDE175

0xC2C4949F
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xD2F08ECE

0xC2C4949F
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0xB043BD23
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0x79A8D063
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x8A1641BE
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0xD7E03622
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x9C45BC3C
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x3C7E013B
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xA9DA4AA9
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x33C83E64
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x87D521DA
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xDE0E6878
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0xE760F54F
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0xFD25B555
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0xE0A7B6BB
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x6AC29427

0xC2C4949F
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0x939444F5
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x7D73D5AD
said--
0xD489085A

0xC2C4949F
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0xF6175BA4
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x48A7C2EA
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x4ED3E7AD
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x6E6E8ACE
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x70318B50

0xC2C4949F
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xF4FB1586
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x69652E30
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x2636106E
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0x82B3F27D
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x1A2267AE
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xA9D58FA9
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0x9CB1CCD5
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x2470666F
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0xE67F14CE
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x472098E1

0xC2C4949F
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0xAC5759CC

0xC2C4949F
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0x166B11F3
give her these porridge."
0x8630A47B

0xC2C4949F
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x5AEE8B5D
pig doesn't want it."
0x1F83CAAD

0xC2C4949F
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0xC3D11504
ravenously.
0x5A1BCF99

0xC2C4949F
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x2E2AA7AC
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x8B079AB1

0xC2C4949F
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x7F42C357
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x367ECA82
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0xEEF3373B
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0xA77D29B3
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0x7BDC2AF5
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xAB28EE3C
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0xC854431A
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0x37BED597
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0xA9758EE5
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0x614F7E8A
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x51517B73

0xC2C4949F
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x59901549
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x0B274C3D
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x509752EB
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x4316AC39
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x3337118D
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x67F79E65

0xC2C4949F
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x95C8F4D1
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0xDCA39387
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0xE0FA686E
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x6B6E15CA
grave."
0x0174C997

0xC2C4949F
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0xA7F61A03
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x1D1DA031
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x152E86A9
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x7077867F
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0x75381AB9
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xFF0F92D7
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x0AABA269

0xC2C4949F
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xA7702DC2
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0xDA4F6B80
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0xC126B2B4
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x70BB87A8
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x6653E5F6
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x2E069F10
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0xF78D1897
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x9B1315E3
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x51B41F52
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xFA46397F
it shut in my face."
0x04F1F678

0xC2C4949F
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0x6C05E228
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0xCB5FD0FB
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0xF95763DD
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0xA153A836
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x6BA86C5E
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0xF0F58CF2
long.
0xC86D2E28

0xC2C4949F
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x4ECBE798
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x79F3587E
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x41B786B6
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0x00EA27AF
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0x9B56951A
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x1A5AAD4A

0xC2C4949F
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0xFFF06B82
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x827556F3
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x1F4BF3EE
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x67870300
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0xEB974A69
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x98B6F39A
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0xA4B669DB
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xB6EC6558
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0x76B6D085
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x046D64B8
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x5E8F09E6

0xC2C4949F
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0xF8C9A9BE
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x7D641875
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x7CBE6AD8
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0xCB1D87B4
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0xE827B973
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x000235AF
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xA3E14F64
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x64B698F9
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xADA17101
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0xA7602F6E
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xD80CBE5E
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0xE1C296FF
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x519C03E0
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x40605274
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x6C355AF8
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x7E94DFC9
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x6958F183

0xC2C4949F
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x23890261
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x77CF7D60
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x95450799
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xCF82C6A1
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x7168EA1F
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x08D2A2CB
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x6480F0A7
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xC6F9937A

0xC2C4949F
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0xA0EE6EA3
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x4124861C
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0xB962A8DE
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x2C76821F
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x34058F8A
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x17C6F3A8
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x4A20D622
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xE7FFFDAD
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x717E15C7
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x836138A2
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x7759DB90
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xE65DCEC1
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x58CD6B48
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x1E345959
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x23D682B6
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0x1394E120

0xC2C4949F
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0xE05B2F8E
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0x41EA0BC5
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x139027F3
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0x3086F302
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x4B037994
German I could not tell.
0xFCFDE1AC

0xC2C4949F
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x1824612D
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x6A51DE82
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x5060654D
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0xCEBC9A1B
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x07B35FB4
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0x3A8EABAE

0xC2C4949F
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x1B1A4CCA
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x6A6ADC85
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x9D73438B
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x279118E5
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0xB46276C4

0xC2C4949F
Both were again silent.
0x52630D2E

0xC2C4949F
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0xB31BA0D4
looking up from her knitting.
0x0017BC7B

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0x9B51E1DC
other way."
0x05DBF39C

0xC2C4949F
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x2ED682D0
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x9879F360

0xC2C4949F
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0xC7B91555
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x0757E96D
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0x1A897519

0xC2C4949F
"And what good does it do you?"
0x8E0D7BF9

0xC2C4949F
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x898EAB17
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x73500269

0xC2C4949F
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0xCAC9218D

0xC2C4949F
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x9217AE26

0xC2C4949F
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0xBA88E41D
master but a lexicon."
0x8DFB7BAF

0xC2C4949F
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0xFBED0C60
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x0BEDA9A6

0xC2C4949F
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xD5664783
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x7ACF5808
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xC3A36B14

0xC2C4949F
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x71718ABC
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xCBBAE0C5

0xC2C4949F
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x4EE4AEBB
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0xB4AA90FF

0xC2C4949F
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0xE78CF076
sad now.
0x40014A33

0xC2C4949F
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x81D50B58
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x1DEB09FB

0xC2C4949F
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x22A74BD4

0xC2C4949F
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0xC9F76910
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x070D1672
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x6139DDB8
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xC7815573
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x75BD522B
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x4CC66667
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x18470795
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0xDBEE6B72
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x1A6C2D36
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x8F3E96B4

0xC2C4949F
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x6B2DE3B7
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x572EEF32
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0xA03AD7F7
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x57FC22B6
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xD4452847
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0x3929A4FF
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0xDE3D100B

0xC2C4949F
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x91E98F90
St. John when he comes in."
0xC4C765C2

0xC2C4949F
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0xCFBD3F49
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x8206E4C0
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0xDF2E805F
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x7A7AD0D9
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x59D67DDB
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0x0991D328
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x00FB64C0
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x91C2BE07
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0xE42A1484
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0xFF983B0C

0xC2C4949F
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x65E82DD9
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xE1ABFA2B

0xC2C4949F
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x1F2DEF02

0xC2C4949F
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0xC76EDFA4
from?"
0x888FF61F

0xC2C4949F
"I am a stranger."
0x7027C5A1

0xC2C4949F
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x46B23CA4

0xC2C4949F
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0xB2BE2465
bread to eat."
0x7127C1C6

0xC2C4949F
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x18440AA3
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x4DB76363
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0xB4121E73

0xC2C4949F
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0x4BCE943B

0xC2C4949F
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x1CC36F17
now; it looks very ill."
0x3BD581ED

0xC2C4949F
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x7E8E4A6F

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0xCBDDA246
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x0961F0D7

0xC2C4949F
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x10A4A764
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0xC3B82B63

0xC2C4949F
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x34D18386

0xC2C4949F
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x6F5BEB09

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0xC0028C57
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x1F6E8FF3

0xC2C4949F
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x0D189D6B

0xC2C4949F
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x5916C6B6
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0xE9790170
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x902AFDEA
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0x08DFAA97
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0xBD999945
bolted it within.
0x8A532137

0xC2C4949F
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0xC46AB1EE
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0x18F00B65
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x0BF2EC35
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0x74AA16AD
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x67717E76
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x98B8AC4E
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x2536BB4D
endeavoured to regain.
0x2AEE6BD9

0xC2C4949F
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0xA797BC40
will in silence."
0xD5437249

0xC2C4949F
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0xFF5051E5
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xC75BF1DE
and still.
0x426A14E1

0xC2C4949F
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0xFCF4541A
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x8CB50DC3
if you perished here of want."
0x0F12BB3A

0xC2C4949F
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0xB5AFA519
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x9F6F4940
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xB43D811C
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x5A9D3B3C
to the door.
0xD4B4995C

0xC2C4949F
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x46D380C8

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0xB0FCE75F

0xC2C4949F
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x9E48CC01
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0x4084C4AF
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x7AE65900
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x75C97180

0xC2C4949F
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0xA03B8170
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x5476DA41
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x5D8BDB0A
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0x97338169
house."
0x77471A13

0xC2C4949F
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0xA5708565

0xC2C4949F
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0x241508D3
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x6BA79B51
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0x2E908976
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0xBAF446B8
me.
0x8830A70E

0xC2C4949F
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0x2C6990D4

0xC2C4949F
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0x0BBF1A61

0xC2C4949F
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x491BB240

0xC2C4949F
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x6F7C30F6
sit."
0x1832EA67

0xC2C4949F
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0x94919DBF
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x22122859

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0xB75E4437
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xCC3035E8

0xC2C4949F
"A mere spectre!"
0xAA95AC05

0xC2C4949F
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x4BAB95AF

0xC2C4949F
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xF9761DAE
bread."
0x6770A4A8

0xC2C4949F
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0xA918753D
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x1CAB28A9
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x5A1638D8
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0xB0451102
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xC3643721

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x3B67630D
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x2F3B97DD
first, eagerly soon.
0x1CB6C9E0

0xC2C4949F
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0xE5082FB9
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0x35BB953E

0xC2C4949F
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x6433A158

0xC2C4949F
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0xA986B41E
name."
0x6AE1754E

0xC2C4949F
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x4437F914
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x9851F470

0xC2C4949F
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x63D8D22A

0xC2C4949F
I was silent.
0xBAAC02DD

0xC2C4949F
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x35C55358

0xC2C4949F
I shook my head.
0x992B20DD

0xC2C4949F
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x03A1B37C

0xC2C4949F
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0xD382B0F5
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0x79791115
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0x2451F00D
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x522B29C1
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xC5C47216
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x6846D928

0xC2C4949F
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x45157FBF

0xC2C4949F
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x8310638F

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x68EC1292
took the word--
0x6994F29D

0xC2C4949F
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x814FC01D
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0xC37BFE3B

0xC2C4949F
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x69395C0E
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0xFAA7180D
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0xF10A38F2
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0xE37B1BA5
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x351142EB
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0x4397C3CE
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x3D4D5ADA
silent.
0x2FF7DF8F

0xC2C4949F
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0x5E82C480
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x21971330
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x6F03EAF9
matter over."
0x18F2E3E5

0xC2C4949F
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0xBED69079
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xE85E6CE1
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0x66949618
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xD7937815
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0xBCAB8A24
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x49C1362F
joy--and slept.
0xD44F5F76

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXIX
0xC70D7E73

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0xAA39006D
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0x6A345E69
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x4008E1FE
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xBB2F6F88
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x47810DF4
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0xAF68EE89
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x77B212C9
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x7C0DB57F
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x315945E5
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0xDC892046
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x6717A2C6
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0xC73F1BD7
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0x40A01BD8
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xAF7083ED
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x2866627A

0xC2C4949F
"It is very well we took her in."
0x9099A54C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0xEB1FF432
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0xDA415693

0xC2C4949F
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0x3B0BA511

0xC2C4949F
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x015E09AE
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0xE018A0A9
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0xB70A737C

0xC2C4949F
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0x8340A040
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x913FBA3D
would be agreeable."
0x75068CCA

0xC2C4949F
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xFE1B8DD2
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0xBE7E8345
myself.  I was comforted.
0xD560FFCD

0xC2C4949F
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0xEEFF5466
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0xBDC1B978
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x542553C9
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xFDA4332F
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0xDC7BCCEC
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x5FD31B12
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0xFE05DFA9
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x23A68657
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x388B51C4
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x6B51C22F

0xC2C4949F
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0xA5888BBE
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xAA1A488C
her permanently."
0x9F7D0531

0xC2C4949F
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x37B867E1
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xA551EBA7
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x0384F94D
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x1F51BA5A
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0x547E91E6
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x26BB975B

0xC2C4949F
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x550E8BFC

0xC2C4949F
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x0625A2FA
are quite wanting in those features."
0x8D8A0620

0xC2C4949F
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xCCB14380
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x0BBF37EE
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0x6937DDBF
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0xFF518AC9
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0xC958DC6A
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0x2B847077
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0xE96353CB
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0xF94BA559
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x2DD5082D

0xC2C4949F
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x42224E91
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0x12CB388A
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xAD876909
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0x4785F9D1
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x5B26FDEF
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0xC6E2D984
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x5B1AEE5A
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x4546FD9D
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0xFBFBBCAF
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0xD84A58F4
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0xBBE70695
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0xA47B7C4B

0xC2C4949F
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xA784A39F
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0xC69870AC
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x9195F8AA
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0xABE01A41
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x7E182BCA
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0xF4C0AC8B
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0xE874A08E

0xC2C4949F
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0xFA31180C
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x1FB78A72

0xC2C4949F
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x5032F48E
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x9A99621F
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xDA0CCF96

0xC2C4949F
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0xA716D3A1

0xC2C4949F
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xD1D907C3
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0x4B5AAACE
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x2BFFA121

0xC2C4949F
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0x4C81C92E
than yourself or your young ladies."
0x4AFBE8B4

0xC2C4949F
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x3A25F8CE
nor no brass, I guess?"
0xC6854B22

0xC2C4949F
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x727A1399
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0xDA470F18

0xC2C4949F
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x908371E0

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, very."
0x1DAA1A9F

0xC2C4949F
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0xCBD20743

0xC2C4949F
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x8B76FE1C

0xC2C4949F
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x4007BBC8

0xC2C4949F
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x8C2057B0
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x5E2AF122
basket of the fruit.
0x72DC0AFB

0xC2C4949F
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x8F0BC157

0xC2C4949F
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x737F4E4A

0xC2C4949F
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x7CCDDC38

0xC2C4949F
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x1CE4779C

0xC2C4949F
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x4CFE15A7
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x7050B9BF

0xC2C4949F
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0xAD7C594B
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0x21DB67E6

0xC2C4949F
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0x143A2E22
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x8AA36677
are."
0x2A282855

0xC2C4949F
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x39D53566

0xC2C4949F
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0x25F5FF07

0xC2C4949F
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x7626648A
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xE3E56E92

0xC2C4949F
"That village a few miles off?
0x5ACFA972

0xC2C4949F
"Aye."
0xDBEE67E9

0xC2C4949F
"And what is he?"
0x6DB2A5F8

0xC2C4949F
"He is a parson."
0x8C9E71BC

0xC2C4949F
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x96C4053D
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x788E8DE6
residence?"
0x852A8DCD

0xC2C4949F
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0x28E744B5
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x00A46391

0xC2C4949F
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0xB48CAB17

0xC2C4949F
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x450B3DF5

0xC2C4949F
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0xD556926C

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Their father is dead?"
0xA5B37E16

0xC2C4949F
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x91B61A6C

0xC2C4949F
"They have no mother?"
0xE4344326

0xC2C4949F
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x76C97A7C

0xC2C4949F
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x50602BB6

0xC2C4949F
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0xB24CD573

0xC2C4949F
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0xA31A0BBC
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x91C288EA
beggar."
0xCBEEC93F

0xC2C4949F
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x8084BD12
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0xF7A8F387
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0xB9A02A6F

0xC2C4949F
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0xE2748A4F
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x2769503F

0xC2C4949F
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0xF924BFF7
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x7CA5B784
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0xFD5AD442

0xC2C4949F
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x3D368369

0xC2C4949F
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0xD822C56C

0xC2C4949F
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xBB945165
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x06D403C2
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xA8FDE470
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0xB96A5DE2
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x2A913A8B
to consider poverty a crime."
0x9E07936F

0xC2C4949F
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x8B9CA3D8
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0x4CA730A1
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x309DF620

0xC2C4949F
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x3DAD4905

0xC2C4949F
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x776BE010
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0xA01382C6

0xC2C4949F
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0x6A1FD93C
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0xFF9A2CDB
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0xC24A2A48
the young people.
0x22C0452B

0xC2C4949F
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0xF6081A61
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x76535DB6
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x196208F1
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0xDDB1FF56
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0xF4845114
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0xD35F38F7
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x11745FD7
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x08459EDE
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0xB74B5452
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x8FAA56AA
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xA869A655
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0x0848C376
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x328A8C32
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0xA6D36D49
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xC9FBAFF5
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x98E9C290
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0xEFB01597
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x8815C68E
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0xCD548B2A
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0xD91717DB
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x039B322B
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x5338D156
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0xAADDDA18
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xDBDC0C7D
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x5D82332F
for being united.
0xB5898D02

0xC2C4949F
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x9CBA1F10
ladies and their brother were now.
0xC6FDB441

0xC2C4949F
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0xE90CAF0C
to tea."
0xEFEEA48A

0xC2C4949F
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0xC0D28901
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x7B46F260
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0xE3B586F7
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0x2954642E
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0xB1E385D8

0xC2C4949F
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xFA759503
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x1703B4FD

0xC2C4949F
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x5CC972D5
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0xB407039D
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x4412FCE1
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x883E5F08
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x2C7443F1
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xC79EA66D
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x94EA33C1
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x580C5182
will.
0xBEB0B891

0xC2C4949F
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0x99D65C2B
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0xFE0B53ED
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x0567973E
parlour."
0x2AC0AB28

0xC2C4949F
"I am very well here."
0x4E530907

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x74A90A5A

0xC2C4949F
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x79712614

0xC2C4949F
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x0E607CAC
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0x96A5E0B9

0xC2C4949F
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x99E7006A
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x66FE259D
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x69A304C2
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xB37CF749

0xC2C4949F
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0xCCCA371C
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0xA40EDC32
parlour, and then its occupant.
0xEBC60E40

0xC2C4949F
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x9FC87C7C
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0xBF3C52D1
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x177485EB
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x510449AA
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x98D03A79
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x2A69615F
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0xA5E8E993
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0xD4C4F9D2
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x1F9F64FC
and well saved.
0x872D90E7

0xC2C4949F
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x11B8864C
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xE927F1A5
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0xFA578FF1
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x4CF1F1DB
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x7D82CF8F
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0xC852C8F9
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x2FB54C6D
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x9314C945
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x62B1754A
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x98DFBA3A
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0x3069B59E
fair hair.
0x19EFF64B

0xC2C4949F
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x11CC9113
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x25B4FFE5
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x4CC2F5E1
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xB4653645
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x3DDE0164
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0xFBF5EA99
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x07E2924C
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0x1CED9015
of the oven.
0xE1ECC9B2

0xC2C4949F
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0x12696DF1
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0xD2FF49C7

0xC2C4949F
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x543B4D69
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0xE1F40387
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0xCBBA26F0
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x3263EC0B
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0xF0B6AED0
from the stranger.
0x9ACE314D

0xC2C4949F
"You are very hungry," he said.
0xC8938F59

0xC2C4949F
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0x11B09376
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0xF86A90C4

0xC2C4949F
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x6BC5BAFD
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x0CCECB20
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x0B0A6DF2
immoderately."
0x82898839

0xC2C4949F
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0xE3914C24
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x25F3E5EF

0xC2C4949F
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0xB7EF254B
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0xCF88E31C

0xC2C4949F
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xA1395869
absolutely without home and friends."
0x75931D6D

0xC2C4949F
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x27E1F483
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0xDFCC2432
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0xBC8F8071
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x3FFCD3D3
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x38FD90C0
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x97EA8DC1
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0xDCC1B859
to encourage.
0xA14E0C72

0xC2C4949F
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xB483A572
every connection?"
0x41788983

0xC2C4949F
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x0EBABB4C
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x58F5C77D

0xC2C4949F
"A most singular position at your age!"
0xA33004DA

0xC2C4949F
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x359E6581
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0xD21D3881
explained the quest.
0x03212275

0xC2C4949F
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x689E5C33

0xC2C4949F
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x684E1FC7
St. John," said she.
0xF6270733

0xC2C4949F
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x0263B963

0xC2C4949F
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x02AB91B2
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x9A587C38
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0xAEC7BE16
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0xF76C8293
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x5F380934
out tears as well as colour.
0x87BA9D02

0xC2C4949F
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0xA9D16A50

0xC2C4949F
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x2BFEF492
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x801BFB1A
piercing look.
0x12C59D35

0xC2C4949F
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x8E649E11
secret," I replied concisely.
0x3963436F

0xC2C4949F
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0xC15A19F1
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x621B996E

0xC2C4949F
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0x5496C8EC
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x0D009101

0xC2C4949F
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0xA22CF1A9
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0x3DE9770D
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0xE4449AF1

0xC2C4949F
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xDF4D27BD
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x296588AF
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0xF631B6A2

0xC2C4949F
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x3FDFC41D
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0x49D37B01
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x56C25C86

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x2D74B76A
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x183F3BA2
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0xE66CA427
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xB4FF795F
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x98CBDECD
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xC810F7B2
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xCCC49D11
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0xB260A903

0xC2C4949F
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0xDC50BA4B
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0xF753135C
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x543E77B0
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x431F5D01
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x54F0D334
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0xFF3459D7

0xC2C4949F
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0x8416328B

0xC2C4949F
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x7CB3E614
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0xFE002205
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x1515C71E
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x07BF3B67
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xC54DEE4F
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0xA2DC0342
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0xFC67080D
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x7A2F8092
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0xD559C4FB
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0xE1DD7275
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0x9BD03D07
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x00224A1B
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0xB9D97C19
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0xCF395322
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0x29EF1C74
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x162C7582
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0x3CDF32CC
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0xC75713C9
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x56D5EF3E
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0xE9B6CCF8

0xC2C4949F
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0x2BC03DFB
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x98F5C80A
down now, Miss Elliott."
0x37DD7548

0xC2C4949F
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0xEC4C2CDE
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0xC570D166
once.
0x7F1E90DC

0xC2C4949F
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x778E210A

0xC2C4949F
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x7B2640D7
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xADA3F7DC
sounds strange to me."
0x22A2738D

0xC2C4949F
"Your real name you will not give?"
0x3AE212FE

0xC2C4949F
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0x694A7FE9
lead to it, I avoid."
0x78C76BA8

0xC2C4949F
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x545FC486
be at peace a while."
0x145360CC

0xC2C4949F
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x6D19925F
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x078C02C2

0xC2C4949F
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x3BE9DD6F
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x12AE4BC3
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0xEF620F81
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0x8A59C596
us?"
0xEC93CCA1

0xC2C4949F
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0x796A4064
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x0057C4D3
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x7A0B944E
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0x894E473C

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0xA52A6D35
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0xA90315CD
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0x8ABE8E8B

0xC2C4949F
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x20C9C169
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0x607804A8
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x1C4636AA
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0xF85DAD9B
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0xA28CD457
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0xD662D561
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0x97C1CB99
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x876ABBDA

0xC2C4949F
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x998FB959
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0xC40E9CBB
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0x809F434A

0xC2C4949F
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0xE294D3B7
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0x28CB1E4D

0xC2C4949F
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x5A2AEC46
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x3CAB8BBD

0xC2C4949F
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0x04FE6D4B
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x5B78DABB
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0x7D167040

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0xF3A53C52
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0xE13B184E
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0x3D938A0D
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0xA8FB5C3B
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0xD2CCC15B
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0x3A359667
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x1AF7740E

0xC2C4949F
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x3ABF99D5
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x434684F7
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xBD7964EE
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x61DA0016
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0xD588656E
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xBCB3BB48
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0xCF65845A
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x010D8B6C
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0x05322949
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0xEB30E56E
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x6E2C6517
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0xC563BD5C
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0xF620D459
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x54441DF1
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0xAD100AC6
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x754CF58B
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0xDC6D770B
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0x60C198E8
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x644F5C23
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0xE8F849E8
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x91F5AE49
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0xB73595DA
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0x003BE652
that entranced theirs.
0x15570231

0xC2C4949F
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x48EC6B47
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xC4DEB97F
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x3DDEB668
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x5D2E8E0B
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x1C232560
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0x660446C6

0xC2C4949F
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0xF25E6547
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x58E03BF0
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0xA29CFDD7
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x13D671D5
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0xB676F03F
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0xC3D9988F
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0xC5CD480F
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x5DAE54F6
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0x8E635EE4
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x1E67171F
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x2F910EFF
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x241C7D8B
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0xB432A18D
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0xA2E52EC4
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xBDDE8543
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xEF8BAF15
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0xC152A22C

0xC2C4949F
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0xF28DA6A2
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0xAAFA5E60
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x725F86B9
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x18D9F0FF
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x6143AA78

0xC2C4949F
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x88CD00CA
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0xC2704EE2
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0xBF4ADC57
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0xCB42BA22
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x4F90B171
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x43696A99
cheerful--
0xB397F7B6

0xC2C4949F
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x98E738B8
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0xB8550864
propose to myself?"
0x89827F70

0xC2C4949F
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x213DBBE6
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0x9AFAB2FB

0xC2C4949F
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x906DCBE2
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x0562D31C
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0xE477D09E
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0xDF60F0A5
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0xD78278C0
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x5AE7C7A7
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0xD15D2A15
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xDB9EB1B2
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x067B3687
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0xC17E8FED

0xC2C4949F
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0x1F32D1A9
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x243813EF
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x642529C0
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x6F030A75
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x2C05A7A8
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x9D97D7FA
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0xCEC4647C
delights they could yield.
0x9645972B

0xC2C4949F
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x37D69C4E
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0xDD45C875
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xD8D4B9EB
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x9F4B2557
produced on me.
0xBC90BB40

0xC2C4949F
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0xBB349AF4
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x55503BE4
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0xFBB8CC05
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x29591773
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x313BCC53
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0x04914DB6
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x8A9A2D9C
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x2BEBAC6D
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0x6FA3495D
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0xAF257EBF
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x21FED62B
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x0AA5253E
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x01F5525C
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0xC18BE84B
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xD752644D
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x374DBA2C
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x0EF7E6F3
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xE1EA1A2A
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xB45377F0
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x4BB54B7F

0xC2C4949F
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x55CAA960
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x3B57A3BF
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0xD1BAC3CC
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x0E618F43
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x5641546D
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x93E8D233
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0xB84AFABC
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0xFB2AD6F7
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0xF5C0C279
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xDDBCEE9F
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x8CF506A8
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0xECC802AB
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x5EAE1A0E
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x5576F6ED
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x60FECBA5
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0x600E9496

0xC2C4949F
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0xAE6FB380

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x3D86B228
myself to undertake?"
0xB1884E53

0xC2C4949F
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x289E8808
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0xD6112BC3
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0xF6FEA2DB
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0xC8F9A03D
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x5824168A

0xC2C4949F
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x04726999

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x42A8DA23
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x4FD84BCC

0xC2C4949F
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x80DD8521
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x6BABEC1C
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x832E2A65
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0x8A8C19CB
interest to me.
0x7BBCA36C

0xC2C4949F
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x74B0CCBD
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x660D30EA

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0xBDA0B48C
you to accept."
0xCD89DEC6

0xC2C4949F
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0xA86CB474
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0x2250C056
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x66A4D272
could have done, and with less trouble.
0xFA383EB1

0xC2C4949F
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0x09DA7B12
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x5000185B
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x0B48CC8D
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xFA822A75
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x735DB4EC
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x4E031005
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x0695A9B2
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0x49222095
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0xB00EE4C2
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x9CC34E68
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x6171A50B
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x60BD5D54
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x0B15E94A
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x534280A8
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x86391431

0xC2C4949F
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0xF4B1EEB2
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xE329E468
glance.  He resumed--
0x1CE5A1A0

0xC2C4949F
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0xC0E7E4A0
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x1DCDD58B
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x9A965262
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x4C020E1F
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0xAD476999
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0xC96C564E
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x671BE240
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0xE5AABEE9
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x009EAE9B
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0x8E2D0C10

0xC2C4949F
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x64574C27

0xC2C4949F
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0xCA85CCBE
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x04E928BB
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x1D658E3D
succeeding observations.
0xA79BBAA3

0xC2C4949F
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x60C943DC
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x558ADB8D
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0x3F59F0BC
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x90EE3B0B
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0xFCD17C3A

0xC2C4949F
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0x2D594F39

0xC2C4949F
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x69A3F6F3
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0xC79FF376
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x712D6690
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xDDAC23C3
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x9A0AE4E8
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0xAB7D14B8
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x2F9ECCEE
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x55177DF8
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xB10743DF
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x12CE5074
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0x7528472A
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x85523AC4
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0xB4C35D19
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0xF33C340F
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0x7B5A55D9
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0xBC1DBE72
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0xCD8CFA33

0xC2C4949F
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0xFB3C696B
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xCAE9F05F
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x06236FA6
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0xE9E3A07C
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0x58D99ADC
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0x29DCF774
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x2ED000E4
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0x9E1E26CF
decision.
0x2132105E

0xC2C4949F
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x540BB688
heart."
0x26A02EF8

0xC2C4949F
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x66639C47
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x852A030E
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0xA081BB70
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x5867E7E5
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0xD8185DFA

0xC2C4949F
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0xFE80E33B

0xC2C4949F
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x6E656CC9

0xC2C4949F
"I do."
0x8DA50A73

0xC2C4949F
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xA2EEDF29
deeply gratified.
0xE451E22B

0xC2C4949F
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0x5AF326CE

0xC2C4949F
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x827B50F7
week."
0x446D10F6

0xC2C4949F
"Very well: so be it."
0x87530596

0xC2C4949F
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x84A2AB29
me.  He shook his head.
0x596EA2BB

0xC2C4949F
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x608946E7

0xC2C4949F
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0xD458B3F4

0xC2C4949F
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x4A9B4E5E

0xC2C4949F
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x215B8FF2
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x050846D2

0xC2C4949F
"I am not ambitious."
0xCCFA8C08

0xC2C4949F
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x87A75D00
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x4A27F11E
it out?"
0x066BF6FB

0xC2C4949F
"I was speaking of myself."
0x702898B4

0xC2C4949F
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x7DEA1B69

0xC2C4949F
"What?"
0xF61FE132

0xC2C4949F
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0xB655C5AD
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0x6B9BF8BF
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0xF6897F1D
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x8723DD4C
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x2F2FFC79
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x35BFDD72
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x75417C11
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x5B8FD073
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xCEC988C4
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0xA764BDBA
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xE0D1FA3B
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xD53A1B9D
some means."
0xEC5E1FCA

0xC2C4949F
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x47C55148
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x15DF0B11

0xC2C4949F
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x61C3B1BB
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x077C9EF1
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x883DAB40
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x70EA5F51
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x38CE38B3
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0x5373C3B4
parting for life.
0x05627D6D

0xC2C4949F
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0xD1E52FAF
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x65A93C35
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0x2DC851F9
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0xA08C287E
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x8ECC95A7
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x1A53BBDE
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0xF2A34DA8
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0xEF2B02AA

0xC2C4949F
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xDB0F4C9D
she murmured.
0x47EEACAF

0xC2C4949F
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x4A70E523
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x16A1DABA
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0x8DF1D73F
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0xD789F20C
letter.  He entered.
0x98E166C9

0xC2C4949F
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0x2133B3DE

0xC2C4949F
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0xBA1BF8BD
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x3C973266

0xC2C4949F
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x66D3B4A2

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xC8BA62AC
demanded, in a low voice.
0x20B4BBED

0xC2C4949F
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0xC5884CA9
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0xDABCE156

0xC2C4949F
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0xFE94F7B6
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xB57DF808
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x496880DA
enough.
0x6CC49932

0xC2C4949F
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0xE9171328

0xC2C4949F
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x15450F7C
Mary.
0x8008F228

0xC2C4949F
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x33A36AFC
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x7C893828
what _is_."
0xAA44436B

0xC2C4949F
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0xA36D279F

0xC2C4949F
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0xC3B81ADC

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x606EC66E
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0xAF66A4BD
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x002F69E7
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0xF981B89F
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x0EE8E94B
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0x04242F1C
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x2AD68C35
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0xA6EB0ECA
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xD113840B
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0x7F90D2E1
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0xA6C0E3CC
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x0166D1F3
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x4076C603
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x4D1D755F
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x4CCD6A57
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x34B547D9
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x4331F6DA
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0xD21928B0
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x86FBC889

0xC2C4949F
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x66E8D40E
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xE31D1DB1
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0x436AA755
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0xB4CBF847
and so the old grange was abandoned.

CHAPTER XXXI
0x35B049D8

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x7296988A
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x9EF00328
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x016E4992
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x6AC75702
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x9519B2AD
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0xF82B0A62
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0xAD7D7E78
things as are necessary.
0x48259FDA

0xC2C4949F
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x65E8E75B
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x165CE8A7
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x0771D27D
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0xFCA6955E
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x0E5E2053
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x8F42C124
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xE6B3D250
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0xCA0F354B
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0xD5999A7E
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0xB20FD0D3
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0x6AB36778
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0xFD836F8B
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x8B2E6567
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xC2E9A626
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0xB5AED099
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0xA0BA03AE
on from day to day.
0x4268DA26

0xC2C4949F
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xBFAEE5C4
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x4B6843DD
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0xB161CD09
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x144A450B
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x759384EF
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x8354C745
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0x6D319C5F
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x6C9204EC
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0xDFB137FA
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x648367A3
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xB3C63D58
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0x43FBEA5A
gratification for disgust.
0xCB1BB312

0xC2C4949F
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xECB624C2
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xC91D4A2C
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0xFF6672EF
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x3AC8D73A
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x98E5173A
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xD0A6EA6E
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0xDF70D41F
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x69377D17
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0xE198550C
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x1F2D33D2
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x20742E59
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0xDAA881FA
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0x9F054FAF
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0x1B20D781
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x9ECA8860
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0xF46CCF65

0xC2C4949F
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x524425E7
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0xD57AF5CE
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x1341B9A0

0xC2C4949F
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x1DF48474
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xA98E9B63
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x960F286E
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0xCEA5D0C7

0xC2C4949F
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0x3F66739E

0xC2C4949F
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x9D901B59
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x598112CA
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xAE36514C
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x1E260F03
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0xA3BF1D69
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x34DDF3E7
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x811120BB
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xF772261F
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x6E449E9A
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x121CCBD6
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x8C6CC2B1
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0xD6DEF261
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x87069D43
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x9C0CB82F
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x870DA986
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x5DC4D9FF

0xC2C4949F
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0xD0B89EBF
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0x6D5273D4

0xC2C4949F
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0xDDF6D848
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0xE6DF1121
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x13FAFF30

0xC2C4949F
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x5C8D1C0E
asked.
0x1173F843

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0x904F540F
scholars very well."
0x0449ECDE

0xC2C4949F
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x19E4339E
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x65A95E74
I interrupted--
0x261AEB4E

0xC2C4949F
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x9351F880
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x1182AAD4
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x2F230B92
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0x01D01D8F
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0x5B2FA343
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x8D8EE1B1
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x1E55626F

0xC2C4949F
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0xFC947665
is dark and empty."
0x54A63848

0xC2C4949F
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0xFE53EAAC
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x55B6B007

0xC2C4949F
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x57666869
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0xCEBAF748
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x97EEBB79
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0xF069EE78
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x26E6498D
steadily, for some months at least."
0x4550DDE2

0xC2C4949F
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x1EA2C2A5

0xC2C4949F
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x5452D94D
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xACE90335
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0xD74FCB3D
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xBBDAEC92
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0xC765A95A
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xF16E030C
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x274C649F
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x734DAAED
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x1CEF8A3F
rougher than it.
0x3D53D8DC

0xC2C4949F
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x0A920B3F
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xC8853E90
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x17B021B7
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0xC20E761E
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x79FA03D4
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x7FEEEA88
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0xE1875351
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x851D316F
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x26571771
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0xA282038B
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0x3711223F
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0x187F0F52
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0xC717AE32
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x8BF0989E
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0xE2788094

0xC2C4949F
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0xC16A300E
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x90F6CF50
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x723FFD13
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x0CAF712F
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0xDA8FE12F
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0xE4DE77CF
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x624D21A0
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0xB740635B
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0xD5037AE9

0xC2C4949F
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x7C1DD6E0
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0xA118ED34
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x92D3BB06
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x15BC4A19
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xB89B5DB5
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x38719BF4
exclaimed--
0xC0016638

0xC2C4949F
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0xEF1B71A0
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x637C4729
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xCEF6EBDC
your back towards me now."
0xEB04EC6D

0xC2C4949F
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0xF21C7EB2
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xD39DA1F1
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0xA56FBD6C
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x55C2577F
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0xEFA3C667
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0x47F37838
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x96C3F769
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0xBC77003B
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x69814E27
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x07B94F22
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0x0F50B4A3
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xC8233973
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x42499BE2
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xF6F2838A
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x53D67A40
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x047F3085
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x33AD9C20
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x5D4CBDC1
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x8E7D7410
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x3A66C9CD
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x98FE9840
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0xB6CB22EA
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x0CC28FD7
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x1C4931BD
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x2FD48BC9
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x8AAF1DEA
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xCA508E02

0xC2C4949F
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0xE7A04C74
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x70E96131
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0xDC690A2C
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x0A0B94BA
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x1F4A8083

0xC2C4949F
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x1A372AFD
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x129DA162

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xEBB10EA0
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x26FEF66C
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x4AC22C18
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x237483DC
pointing to me.
0x38CBF740

0xC2C4949F
"It is," said St. John.
0xF97B7F97

0xC2C4949F
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x67622B36
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0xE257C16B

0xC2C4949F
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0xEB268103

0xC2C4949F
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0xE421EF11

0xC2C4949F
"Quite."
0x5989CAE9

0xC2C4949F
"Do you like your house?"
0x8D8C53C6

0xC2C4949F
"Very much."
0x0155ABE7

0xC2C4949F
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0xEAAC37BE

0xC2C4949F
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x84740DC3

0xC2C4949F
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x05F0E22A

0xC2C4949F
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x34A0260F
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0xB0416031
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x81395F26
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0xC5A24FF9

0xC2C4949F
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xA9DC014D
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0xA98B02D6
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x39C550BE
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x3D3DBD83
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0xD9DBAF27
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0xF99C6841
merchants to shame."
0xF81EB0C7

0xC2C4949F
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x02DB44A5
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0xD07176F6
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0xF6C6E218
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xD5A6B2A6
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0xC34FD065
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0xA21941E9
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0x0A0422A3

0xC2C4949F
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x3E0D2FC8
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0xE88FE8B8
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xC07459D5

0xC2C4949F
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x44BFE298
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0xE15D60EF
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0x2E43CFA5
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0xFE60656B
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x358430A5
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x570689A1
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0xD2012EC2
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0x51F72269
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x99307402

0xC2C4949F
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0xA1D53A1C
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x82AC4E57
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x091CF122

0xC2C4949F
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x3142574E
John.
0xCEDB78EB

0xC2C4949F
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0xC8723955
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x86BBF4F4
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0xC4260219
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0x37391166
her own.
0xA3028AD2

0xC2C4949F
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0x0B9F84EC
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0xBF4F03F2
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x7E7B6E1A
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0xEA42F9E2
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0xA47A10DE
papa."
0xD79467FB

0xC2C4949F
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0xF786E9BC

0xC2C4949F
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0xEE947C6B
it cost him thus to refuse.
0xE8378854

0xC2C4949F
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0xEA1F5385
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x82527459

0xC2C4949F
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0x6D6916EF
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x3F3B8772
returned.
0x38F22009

0xC2C4949F
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x210A7751
blanched as her gown.
0x633C0A00

0xC2C4949F
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0xBD29AA76
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x5E01D180
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0xC7ADAAFB
at all.
0xD9A16D81

0xC2C4949F
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x31380286
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0x052549AF
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xDEF6D948

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x644E9551
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x98875228
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0xF447F3EA
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xA9025893
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0xFC2572E6
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x21E2E828
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0xF504B3DD
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x15170667
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x9A11170C
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0xB96F9FD0
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x191D4F5A
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0xC6031BF2
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x1AA68642
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0xBD615714
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xCE4FA8B1
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x12A17573
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x5A9A13F1
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x75E2C4AE
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x61D5830D
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x7A286279
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x40DF2D36
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0xEEADEBE7
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x7F282313
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x2243279E
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0x9AB023D8
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xB459997E
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x6E484B91
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0x0ED7E462
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xB5B6A7E3
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x32DDCF59

0xC2C4949F
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x1A0382E7
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0xDF44B797
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x34CBCC52
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x69CABAD9
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0x404E6506
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0xF9643412
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xEB7C931C
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x277A9DCA
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x3B91D00B
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x55624F98
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x90399B31
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x221E7259
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x70AF5F6F
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x969BACC9
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x861C8234
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0xCA956750
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x9D6B1FE4
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x27FA689F
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x05E7E65D
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0x9FFE1E14
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x10DA5D92
duties of the day.
0x3D405CC2

0xC2C4949F
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xFAA26052
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x2F7BAC85
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x6E6E0B63
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x5EE033BA
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0xE30905FB
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0x6823FC64
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x28A12CDA
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x8DB5DC95
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x20F716E5
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xED9090EC
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x617136F7
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0xABB6ADD1
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x6080A27D
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x7D4A463D
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x38AEBB0D
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x0A4FA467

0xC2C4949F
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x6E65778C
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x26468C45
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x1271529C
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x27560C78
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x53F310DB
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x065F8A57
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0xEFD94AD3
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xB943E1EA
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x08FAEBF2

0xC2C4949F
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0xBB5914B7
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0xFD7DAE5B
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x609E8362
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xA598675B
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0x119F3BC3
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xC6E6FBAF
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x4404E3B8
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x64B74F42
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x1258529C
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x4F078095
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x1AE6FA26
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xCE54BE44

0xC2C4949F
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x4AD0A0F0
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x6E605823
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xD4E26040
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xF9E038B4
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x5A5E10EF
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0xC9442683
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xD5F83519
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x5340D0DC
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0xE470FC2F
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x164375D6
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x552CD9CD
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xCCE3A379
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x471849C1
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x71EAE7DC
acquaintance.
0x9EBF9031

0xC2C4949F
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x2C39390E
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x1272BEA5
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x655D3F47
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0xC2959426
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0xEA0947E7
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xA13923F1

0xC2C4949F
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0xA03B892F
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x77AE82AC
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x4D92A5BB
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0xBB0AC933
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0xF152F78E
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x104FADCE
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x0D30C8B6
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0x61E9F9EF

0xC2C4949F
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x281A3E18
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x0FF9B190
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0xE6D61067

0xC2C4949F
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x0D1236FA
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0xE29E7704
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0x0FC9CE6C
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x038D928E
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0xFFB907E3
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0x52BED60C
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x9E540EE2
day.
0x11DE5C6A

0xC2C4949F
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xD2B9D3D2
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xAB895C3B
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0xF3E96907
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0xFE836A3B
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0xC7F14B9F
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0xF53AA628
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x90B6CC17
Hall.
0xEE875663

0xC2C4949F
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0x4A0D5CBE
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0xB169A94A
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x4BCAF512
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0x65443AC6
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x3EB3D1E7
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x57C55DB2
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x698119B1

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0x0B741E2F
high family, papa."
0xE19323C1

0xC2C4949F
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x60EC52EB
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0x9855BCEC
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x6B7DF500
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xC13651C5
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0x9AB4A368
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0xEB87C1C6
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0x25DA5077
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0xDE9CA8A1
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x2292B6F7
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0xDBA81EAD
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0xB7A2753C
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xC723242D

0xC2C4949F
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0x139F589A
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x4BBA1BA0
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x7201A551
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x6D87DD3D
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x885727FB

0xC2C4949F
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0xE9EFDAFF
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x4423D603
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x9E4EF8DB
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x0C14C120
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x54F4F421
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x62AD6746
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0xF054A92C
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0x7056081F
Rivers.
0x89EFC6C3

0xC2C4949F
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0x254708B1
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0xF492418B
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0xA820EF50
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xBA61DB49
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x70E24D3B
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x298999C1
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x5AB08262
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0xF4E61414
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xBAE124DF
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0xE579B90C
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x3C93D90B
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0xA6C48DCC
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x31341EE8
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0xBCEF26FB
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0x02D739CC
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0xA5E72680

0xC2C4949F
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x5D4A24E9
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x1EBB7825
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0x517E4F5A
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x515DF41C
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0xA83B6807
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xC5BE95B2
him some good, if I could.
0x8B87551C

0xC2C4949F
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xD68FABCC
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0xBC871FAC
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0xECEEE2D9
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0xA1368B9F
him talk."
0x0037455E

0xC2C4949F
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x896417B1
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x0301EF14
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0x3FBB9072
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0xF81A41BD
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0xC749B193
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x11DA86BE

0xC2C4949F
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0x2194BE34

0xC2C4949F
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xEEC03D78

0xC2C4949F
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x0E503E24

0xC2C4949F
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x11F1DE35
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xE79F580D
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xA337ADED
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0xAFF52B3D
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xD3F4165C
rose and placed it in his hand.
0x16A39616

0xC2C4949F
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x3351365E
graceful and correct drawing."
0xBDBA1B9F

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0xEEF77786
like?"
0xB3EC0313

0xC2C4949F
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0x19EE21E5

0xC2C4949F
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0xD67D8C5E
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x2EBC12A2
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x26295462
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x2AD55448
deem worthless."
0xDE462B27

0xC2C4949F
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0x99D3FA76
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x9016CE5E
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x38FD7D61
smiles!"
0xF87773A5

0xC2C4949F
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x133D10E9
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xBB5611B5
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0xB00437F4
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x42548D18

0xC2C4949F
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0x5C3CC1C1
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x82813D27

0xC2C4949F
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0x80B17904
or wise is another question."
0x44C568F2

0xC2C4949F
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x7D59E146
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0xA8D7706F
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x926D7B09
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0xCB4934C3
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0x26AA12DB
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x2573DF95
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x4C822510

0xC2C4949F
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0xDA3D3058
take to yourself the original at once."
0x6B155A37

0xC2C4949F
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x00F73143
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0xE123FF5C
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x7D3368FD
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x211F8488
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xAA18F242
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x98250836
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x634D5B27
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x6798AB6A
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x69C178AF
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x2EADB195

0xC2C4949F
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x0763C33A
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xE6BABD7F
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0xE8C8C152
ought to marry her."
0xCBCECB39

0xC2C4949F
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x5AB15EA1

0xC2C4949F
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x13248B84
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0xFCD603D0
often."
0x08063EA7

0xC2C4949F
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x94A17F75
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0x8AD82BAF
the table to measure the time.
0xCA4110C9

0xC2C4949F
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0xE6951D1F
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x6BEBFC62
fetter your heart?"
0x6451FEC1

0xC2C4949F
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0xCE5B5BD6
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0xDE92C97C
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x4BC767CA
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x90AE2E4E
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x5C297C76
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x90E52497
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0xBC42DEDC
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x0E26321F
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0xD7749B9B
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x75CD18AD
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0x40D9D5A3
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0xECD69A05
time I marked pass in peace."
0x53401770

0xC2C4949F
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x7A081D90
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0x00A4E7ED
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x9826536A

0xC2C4949F
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0x78F3E240
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x6766FFAC
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x81B81BDA
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x5220F497
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x7C9E2F57

0xC2C4949F
I gazed at him in wonder.
0xE832E85D

0xC2C4949F
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x43AEFDE8
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0xD6FE452D
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0xC8464157
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0xD0650965
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0xEB1874B5
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x01B73C24
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x2DE5A003

0xC2C4949F
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0x41342AAB

0xC2C4949F
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x73585EE5
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x78E4FB54
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0x5DE334FC
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x05020D7A
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x9013CD00

0xC2C4949F
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xC71E6C83

0xC2C4949F
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0xBA92D868
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0xF670B90F
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x94F89F2D
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xBDA44D90
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x4F703260
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0xF832D129
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0x95B3C1E5
live for."
0xA2C40E44

0xC2C4949F
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0xDB1055A6
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x44760AB0

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x2C8B5CD0
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x0BBB4910
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0xE3E24305
should do."
0x85CA7D61

0xC2C4949F
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0x7FA65B92
wasting away."
0xDCBC08BF

0xC2C4949F
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x472B75F4
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x581AAE73
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x82348F71
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xD67D7761
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x172E20E9

0xC2C4949F
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x82192B1A
schoolroom."
0x94E435E4

0xC2C4949F
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x82F3FF61
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0x4EF2D4F5
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x370412B1
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0x8E250273
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x6327C9B7
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x89BCC9C2

0xC2C4949F
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0xE3E0338B
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0x7884A209
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0x3780D3D3
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x7127FFA2
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x32B1AEC5
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x22E467AD
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x1204B361
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x74FDEB6E
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x563C7377

0xC2C4949F
I smiled incredulously.
0x9865F99E

0xC2C4949F
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x8539EB3A
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x7E91A952
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x59F1627F
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0xD3E6060A
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x56F3182F
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0xA00DD321
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x37AD3363
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0x83DE3142
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x22C068E5
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0xD47CB5A0
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x930E3759
still suffer."
0x5B4724EE

0xC2C4949F
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x33BBB9BD

0xC2C4949F
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x476E40F0
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0xB9EA6F1B
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0xCF4785CB
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x8F50135F
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x8FFD5A1B
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0xEBEA8C6E
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0xC25451F6
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xB19A098D
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x2DEB8019
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x68B728FE
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x018A509F
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x5DE6E3AF
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x3EEFD38C
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x10A3D166

0xC2C4949F
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0xF84D7659
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x1831A345

0xC2C4949F
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0xDE561157
World, indeed!"
0x6D6A8763

0xC2C4949F
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x04E4A685

0xC2C4949F
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x41B6A316

0xC2C4949F
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x69D625AC
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x2562AB7D
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x65C887E0
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x871229DF
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0x2F8DFF3F
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x4E86A355
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x72B45D33
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0xCD09425B
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x10C8FF6B

0xC2C4949F
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x02EB48E3

0xC2C4949F
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0xF04B8BC2
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0xBEC12336
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x86CE2A39

0xC2C4949F
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xCDD0047B
globe, however!"
0x8628FD17

0xC2C4949F
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0xAC0C6107
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x81C08233
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x9F0DE405
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0xD6B0E37A
forgot it.
0x14F7F52A

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXXIII
0xB4425351

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x1CB753ED
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x079331F9
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x880E2BFF
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x1811ED10
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0xF49C2861
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xFE3E6B64
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0x56705468

0xC2C4949F
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0xD2A9D672
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x049755F6
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0xA85DC58E
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xB2514FB1
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x2B34F5C8
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x93C0FC38

0xC2C4949F
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x97009CDC

0xC2C4949F
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x8847843A
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0x2D243062
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0x1ED51259
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0xE4043A76
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0x0C9611C5
vale that night.
0x7AAF1544

0xC2C4949F
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x1C658B58

0xC2C4949F
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0xEFC186C4
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x43319325
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xE6CC2B41
boots.
0x4CB3BC10

0xC2C4949F
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0xEE078B5E
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x5723A7E6
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0xC70B80EC
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0x2054701F

0xC2C4949F
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x71940401

0xC2C4949F
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0xFCB15A75
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x02F498A6
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0xB7BAA7DA
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0xFC771539
impatient to hear the sequel."
0xD2A90AAB

0xC2C4949F
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x5D970057
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0xC32CC328
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x1641DD44
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x0B9FBB4C
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x96C0A1DD
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0xF9121D37
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0x9CCA9C0A
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xA98982EE
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0xF7652BA0
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xEA1C30DA
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x61ECC519

0xC2C4949F
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0xD8F89943
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xA17F589A
health."
0xC64764D2

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x5AC6EBB9
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x32A436D6

0xC2C4949F
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xFEF3D315
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x9F37E746
silenced.
0x379F36E1

0xC2C4949F
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x36BF8FF5
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x35474D0D
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x508EFE29
was behind him.
0x694BEC56

0xC2C4949F
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0xFB28D135

0xC2C4949F
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0xB2DD2955
alone now, and return to my book."
0xC8FECA92

0xC2C4949F
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x9A88E1E5
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x3F74D413
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x9D2CA0F9
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0xE4C088A4
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x0E8B1BEC
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x58E752B4
I would.
0x0F5016EA

0xC2C4949F
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x700787CE

0xC2C4949F
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0x30F366CA

0xC2C4949F
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0x0F921C49
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xE157CC3A

0xC2C4949F
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x6609B1FF
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x107F486E
and my scholars.
0x13A0C831

0xC2C4949F
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x5CAE2B55
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0xD693CB53
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x7B5BC19E

0xC2C4949F
"Indeed!"
0x9E5885E3

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x37A9458E

0xC2C4949F
"Does he?"
0xFF165A36

0xC2C4949F
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0xF36DC4DE

0xC2C4949F
"I know."
0x51E4CD04

0xC2C4949F
"Was it your suggestion?"
0xEC859F17

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"Whose, then?"
0x2747E515

0xC2C4949F
"His daughter's, I think."
0x2A4DB029

0xC2C4949F
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x209911B8

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x7A98F865
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0xACC43DF7

0xC2C4949F
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0xB953C06D

0xC2C4949F
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xE9FA95D1

0xC2C4949F
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0xFD3E89D8
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x1E8EC7A8
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0x3EAFED99
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0xF728360A
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x4CAADA28
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x3E0C2A79
trite or novel, it is short.
0x09167431

0xC2C4949F
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x4A6DD5D5
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x777C41A3
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x3F86C97D
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x2C24A8D5
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0xFE40F4A0
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0xDDD6FF44
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xBD7E3A6F
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xE1BF2F66
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0x7102AF1F
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0xC936053E
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0x3662E921
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0xE1EEAC62
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xDA711E4C
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xE7C05604
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x7A7B80EF
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x0873009F
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x668AC1AD
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x9F1BB818
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x42D6F431
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x5D99F0D7
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0xA60FA158
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x43F0A2E4
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0xE6528A71
Rochester."
0x8F90C940

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x3327A098

0xC2C4949F
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0x4692620E
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x9CE6DB53
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xCD511128
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x5AB781ED
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0x0F41D852
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x1BFE8AB5
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0x766BB829
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0x45EDD290
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x14A344D4
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x5AA482BF
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x430986E6
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x9D389BE0
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x72FE1F0B
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x4A02FB1D
odd tale?"
0xEE9B00A5

0xC2C4949F
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0xC9769668
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x27AD9DA8
doing?  Is he well?"
0x7A635685

0xC2C4949F
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0xEFAC6F58
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x71120EAA
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xCE08FA08
which requires her appearance."
0x6AE5A97F

0xC2C4949F
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0x91A01521

0xC2C4949F
"I suppose not."
0x82A51C65

0xC2C4949F
"But they wrote to him?"
0xFFD710E0

0xC2C4949F
"Of course."
0xFF5660B5

0xC2C4949F
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0xECDD39DA

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0x7178BF40
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0x76726BB0

0xC2C4949F
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x91B43429
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0x967F8FBA
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x488C954E
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0xBEEF5965
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x432ECD89
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0xBB035A3C

0xC2C4949F
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0xA013FE35

0xC2C4949F
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0x785F1BD0
warmth.
0x7C2BEEDA

0xC2C4949F
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x224125E7
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x0804CB4C
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x20621F14
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0xC6F50F89
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xCC2D71BB

0xC2C4949F
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x5B380365
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0x157300FC
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x353EF472
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x1DA56AE3
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x67D5A47E
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x3D473A84
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0x6F38CEB0

0xC2C4949F
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0x9A346D30
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xB1DD6400
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0xEC4B10AC
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x4EDB2316

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x9DA91107
Rochester than you do."
0xDAFDDB81

0xC2C4949F
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0x08874C9B
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0xD5482FA9
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x708C81D5
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x14B820A0

0xC2C4949F
"Well, what did he want?"
0x9D691AD1

0xC2C4949F
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0x53FD5437
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0x272FCCC9
that--nothing more."
0xE715E1BB

0xC2C4949F
"I!--rich?"
0x6C3815F4

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x62109598

0xC2C4949F
Silence succeeded.
0x71C34C41

0xC2C4949F
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x5F62C541
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0x5CF51177
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x66A671CD
will and the necessary documents."
0xBCD4709F

0xC2C4949F
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x5A2F8E1B
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0x1F772A51
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x0C32EAF9
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x2BB15BC5
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0x59CD0428
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x58B8EE3B
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x1A57E7A2
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0xC5A3D89F
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0xF0C9354A
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x209F9656

0xC2C4949F
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0xA7024E2D
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0xC1671E68
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x084124D3
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0xF5BF9B80
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0x0924AD3E
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0xE04B97EB
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x1A1F33D2

0xC2C4949F
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0xED81601E
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x06AB6233
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x1AD093E2

0xC2C4949F
"How much am I worth?"
0xD64E07CF

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x2801CCAA
think they say--but what is that?"
0xD7E2871B

0xC2C4949F
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x6490D473

0xC2C4949F
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0xA4770F9D
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0x24A83E79
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0xA3BC5BCE

0xC2C4949F
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x32BD5FBD
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xDF518B06

0xC2C4949F
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xC64A2485

0xC2C4949F
"No mistake at all."
0xF123C4E8

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x5287853C

0xC2C4949F
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x8322F22A

0xC2C4949F
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x85592C02
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0xDAB4BA19
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0xAC3FF2FB

0xC2C4949F
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0xCF40EC63
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xE0B6E8C8
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x875048BC
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x364EA20D
Good-night."
0xDFA4B56F

0xC2C4949F
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0xFA8A8A4D
minute!" I cried.
0x723D8F59

0xC2C4949F
"Well?"
0x2BC6707D

0xC2C4949F
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0xCA7D7A92
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0xFD932EF9
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xF4131B76

0xC2C4949F
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xA891605C
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0xEDF98AE9

0xC2C4949F
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x4DBF93D7
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0xEDCBDB19
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0xDEF5FDEC

0xC2C4949F
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x7937B5B8
about it."
0xD75E3E50

0xC2C4949F
"Another time."
0xD1EFAA6A

0xC2C4949F
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0xDC33C5D7
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x5A529ED6

0xC2C4949F
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0x7EB0EFE8

0xC2C4949F
"I would rather not just now."
0x7FEEE64E

0xC2C4949F
"You shall!--you must!"
0x59440B20

0xC2C4949F
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0xE665DDD9

0xC2C4949F
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x66D55272
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x74D3803C

0xC2C4949F
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0xE7F1BB3B
persuade."
0xDD8CD3AA

0xC2C4949F
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0xB7F6B2C3

0xC2C4949F
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0xB81A48D9

0xC2C4949F
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x7DEFB7E9

0xC2C4949F
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x5561E576
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0x97828828
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0x54A9B12D
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0x8AD372FD
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0x4B27C9E6

0xC2C4949F
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0x5FD36B41
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0xC847F70B
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x3D8B7286

0xC2C4949F
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0xB3F49719

0xC2C4949F
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xFA352935
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0xA268473C

0xC2C4949F
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0xBF19E504
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0xE71C5707
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0xCC4A0513

0xC2C4949F
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x44433246
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0x5B6808B0
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x7F0B5BFD
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x11B6C093
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x113371D6
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0x91848349
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x38325CEA
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x3760050E
explanation.
0xC1D5350D

0xC2C4949F
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0xBD8A2A64
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x66248856
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x944E41A1
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0xF2DDC85E
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0xC5F3B855
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x6335D905
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x5357A2F7
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0xA9CDC98E
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x6F415868
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x49615B42
against the door.
0xC15F9743

0xC2C4949F
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xE8BFF518
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0xF8690832
enough.  I resumed--
0x2696985B

0xC2C4949F
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0xACA5887D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x1EAE518E

0xC2C4949F
He bowed.
0xBCB5C9B4

0xC2C4949F
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0x4DB5040F
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x429C6C84

0xC2C4949F
"Undeniably."
0x24C7DE63

0xC2C4949F
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x719F83E5
the same source?"
0x1F5FD7AF

0xC2C4949F
"We are cousins; yes."
0x4154D274

0xC2C4949F
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xC7CE143A
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0xA3138A1F
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x15F7CD1E
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0x3B4981F3
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0xA34C3632
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x3724557F
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0x63E70E76
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0xB640EADE
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xA6CB6EDA
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x57DCCFB8
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x0B99C8CF
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x8519C24B
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0xE771C988

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x91985E90

0xC2C4949F
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0xCA8EB15B
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x73FA94F5
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0xC4D1CFFB

0xC2C4949F
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x8C0F66B8
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0xBA0EA5AB
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x77193778
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0xC90B91F2

0xC2C4949F
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0xBCFCE43D
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x57B7C602
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x1735B337
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0xEDE43C95
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0x998C1E87
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x2272D217
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0xBFB107E9
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0x80A95D56
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0x840FB591
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0x08B4898E
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x237AE961
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x6A78164D
enjoyment.
0x027F3A46

0xC2C4949F
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x5A0DE227
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x84862D50
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x3566C16F
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x85D385EE
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0x1C5DAA01

0xC2C4949F
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xAEE81647
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0x30A7D674
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0xD5F96091

0xC2C4949F
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0xB51A7B85
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0xE8291061

0xC2C4949F
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x3694A972
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x5E13BF1B
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x06FC128C

0xC2C4949F
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x8CD43287
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0xBBB45ED9

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0xF1DE7689
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0xD8D11C3E

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0xCD8D2232
comprehend better."
0x92ED9964

0xC2C4949F
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0xABB087F8
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x17177F2B
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0xC5A0451C
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0xFC208B9C
fortune that has accrued to them."
0xE2D7A0BB

0xC2C4949F
"To you, you mean."
0x0C78D071

0xC2C4949F
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0x048F622C
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x9F505CD4
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0x538DD0E2
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x4E6D5E9E
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x285DE952
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x4042B0F3
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x5F60C820
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0xBF0265DC
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0x5493CA17
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0x815416C9

0xC2C4949F
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x61B3AFED
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0x45FD9189

0xC2C4949F
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0xCF0B4606
the case?"
0xDC559C8A

0xC2C4949F
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0xAD77E80D
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0x00990E19
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x62D5AF8F
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0xF408B608
consider it absolutely your own."
0xD0500869

0xC2C4949F
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0x1CABE7DD
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0x87C54EEF
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0x510885C1
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x1ED0E12E
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0xB4AF47DA
myself lifelong friends."
0x4814ACAF

0xC2C4949F
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0x2CA6E3C7
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x55ED6509
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0xDA1C8EBC
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0xF95F5139
you: you cannot--"
0x2EF5276D

0xC2C4949F
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0x46055283
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0xC42A9BCE
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x9804CD14
and own me, are you?"
0xFADC00DB

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x31306183
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0x62F0AFA2

0xC2C4949F
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x939A12CA
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x99932613
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0x279E67EF
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x8277A6B9

0xC2C4949F
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x04F0C489
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0xFFBCBAEB

0xC2C4949F
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x585DE358

0xC2C4949F
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0xB2CCE511
excitement under which you labour."
0x6A733D20

0xC2C4949F
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0x861D98A4
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0xDCDE4D7A
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0xA8DA3F40
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0xEB5E9E1B
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0x3F21E057
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0xC47BE332
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0xE8DC4C84

0xC2C4949F
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0xF95DF13D
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0x214DCD55
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0x758924D6
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x1751D001
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0x16B86381
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0xC7374F6B
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0xEB7BF2CB

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0xF9155DBA
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x7AB89668
scruple."
0xC678BF13

0xC2C4949F
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0xDDCFF8E9

0xC2C4949F
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0xE6A6EE0A

0xC2C4949F
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x5752C424

0xC2C4949F
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x4409D698
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0xB6574192
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0xF2D696DF
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x1984C242
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0xF6A73C05
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0xBA13611D
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x341FABE2
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x2910BFEB
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0x37E9AD60
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0xD07BDDC4
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
0xD830FE2F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXXIV
0x593F9667

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x3A83796A
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0x4AE93D1F
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0xE259854C
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0xDD34A24B
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xF22FA607
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x6653E8DF
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0xA6892BDE
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x04DFD733
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x0BEC30D7
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x7D5C8CED
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xCF246AD5

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0x33FD57F4
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0xA5E30961
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xD1B2CDDF
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x713CA1CB
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0x42B19308
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x8A878859
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x3DF685BD
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0xB3C208C8
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x8863A5AA
girls.
0xBE67CB29

0xC2C4949F
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0xDC2781ED
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x2D7EB36B
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0xA768DE9D

0xC2C4949F
"Doubtless."
0x6C844284

0xC2C4949F
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0x3AD6E63F
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xA313D548

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x7B79C219
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x9BBF89C3
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x8176B8FC
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x3F10170D

0xC2C4949F
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x9B783462
What are you going to do?"
0x807C4024

0xC2C4949F
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0xDD788357
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0xD05BCFED

0xC2C4949F
"Do you want her?"
0x7932CD80

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x40A9E674
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x31C137D6

0xC2C4949F
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0xA268EC76
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x08214CBF

0xC2C4949F
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x39BF7B4E
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x1563E197

0xC2C4949F
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x8DA8F1B3
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x458F46E0
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0x5CA45B7C
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0xDED3D9BD
now?"
0x344A6087

0xC2C4949F
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0xB8A538A3
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x618EDE97
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x2A3CD452
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0x30CD7EFE
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0xB708B438
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x599DFA58
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xC091C8C9
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x9718AB10
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x2741F794
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0xA2B6D2CA
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x0F4C16BA
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0xDE36A5C2
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x3D7DEC5B
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0x0F05DA93

0xC2C4949F
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0xDA705153

0xC2C4949F
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x01022DDF
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xD790B840
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0xF1A2E041

0xC2C4949F
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0x7BFE68FA

0xC2C4949F
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0x09D2BBA0
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0x049A0547

0xC2C4949F
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0x33982E86

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xC35A3099
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0x466985BB
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0xA9E3CA02
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0xAC32C099
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0x4361296D
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0xB73FD712

0xC2C4949F
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0xB26E19A3
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0xDE8A2642
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x84592FE5

0xC2C4949F
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x11E6A18D
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xA35F537C
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x3720FBE3
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x6B830918
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0x2DD76C4F
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0xFECEE270
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x2142D9E9
hear, Jane?"
0xD34AFB32

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xFADD356D
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0xEFDE03CA

0xC2C4949F
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x4C7C79A6
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x6ECDE3A1
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x644E52C2
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xD16E9591
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0x0EB4BD1E
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x15A12823
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x9508C4B4
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x4F0612FF
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x7FD28897
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0xA852A844
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0xC5356011
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0xEB51813A
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0x041F0DDA
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0x4559D4A3
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0xBE16C213
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x658C6E42
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0xE759E493
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0x64801A79
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0xD40C7D52
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0xA5812CFC
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x0A5A0464
without.
0x7E09B872

0xC2C4949F
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x0513A03F
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0x0F73D18D
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xE8F56A46

0xC2C4949F
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x4FC78F06
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x393ABA29
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xB73E34D2
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0xAF5A875F
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0xF5C63D5B
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0xD2D3A976
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x1FFA43F4
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x219A46DD
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0xBE8546CD
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x658B5C60
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0xD6DFC058
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x6753E088
improved aspect of his abode.
0x51100864

0xC2C4949F
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0x8D5553B7
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0x53533A41
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0xD052073B

0xC2C4949F
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0xB9887F81
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0x068F2157
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0xAC9F9775
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0xC311904D
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0x2D11CE1A

0xC2C4949F
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x0663A659
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xEF131F11

0xC2C4949F
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x79E8EAAB
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0xEBDD18E5
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0xB8CD1337
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x57A07532
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0xAEC18962
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0x026FAA76
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x35A191D1
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0x644BBCC3
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x72B86C10
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0xD66FC130
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0x0132B994
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x23123969
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x7C680FBA
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0xC417A0A9
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xE45CFC20
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0xFA50BCE6
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0xE9B2E727
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x0E252C53

0xC2C4949F
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x054615A6
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0xC0FA9EF6
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x0867C56B
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x4B0920AC
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0x1F82C686
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0xD63C3C23
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0xCD525B6E
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x7DEBD735
career--I see it now."
0x07539C40

0xC2C4949F
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0xD016A64D
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x92075F8D
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0xD43E134F
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x2AAAD424
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x97EA6C90
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xDCAE2D46
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x6E546C60
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0xA45D3F93
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0x9233D3C3
into the house.
0x7AE3C906

0xC2C4949F
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x2BF5D68A
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x9DAA4BE3
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0xD40D8072
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x18395AE0
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x28A60828
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0x13D5FD2B
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xD5A9B9CD
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x55F47078

0xC2C4949F
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xF23BFA6D
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x6BEA1737
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0x3A1037B6
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0xF882F244
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0xBA2152DC
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x250CCA17
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0xE16786D4

0xC2C4949F
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0xACC0BF11
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0xBB862B16
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0xC188B663
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x88B1BF77
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x340AC21C
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0xBC0A7164
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0xBE140977
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0xB2A2C4AD
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x0B666903
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x6D53F6F7
mother, who was drawing away."
0x1242F479

0xC2C4949F
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xB44AE739

0xC2C4949F
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x2408AE53
the way."
0x5E11295B

0xC2C4949F
"Tell him I will go."
0xA1581C37

0xC2C4949F
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0xB66B9D35
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0xC57663D9
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0xC58BB6E2
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x844118F2

0xC2C4949F
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x0C467B29
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0xE56A7D33
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x0F52BB9F
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xC18CEBAA
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0xD4AAECE4
with himself.
0xE37FB5B9

0xC2C4949F
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0xE0BE0FFC
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0xDD1313B2
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x5F449C41
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0xEDF408CF
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x411906D9
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x6BEA5531
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x7AA3CBF7
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x21FEABBE
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0x32AA0E80
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0x0E378E46
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0x9E738E2B

0xC2C4949F
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0xAD527E70
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x1E9A8E76

0xC2C4949F
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x090BBA45
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0x28F38434
ensuing year.
0xB5A2E901

0xC2C4949F
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x9C5E4685
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x2194D6BC
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0xE717F3A9
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x8015AEEE

0xC2C4949F
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x968A82A7
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x04248F02
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0xC9940FC9
yesterday."
0x90B0ABD2

0xC2C4949F
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x21634FC7
he was serene as glass.
0x77AFFCE3

0xC2C4949F
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x1077F87F
known each other long."
0xE832A2DE

0xC2C4949F
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x5A351032
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0xD04B986A
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0xBC797CDB
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x4EB48F29
can he refitted for their reception."
0x0DF9EB65

0xC2C4949F
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x9BE97D9D
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x5F57B9D3
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x3E86C843
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x31E6290A
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0xE81743A3
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x412AF2BA
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x5258798A
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x6842029B
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x2D482656
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0xD3F8E17D
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x2D7593C6
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0xD384BD4F
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x79C12E66
frigidity.
0xDD70629F

0xC2C4949F
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x789BF0BF
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x3EFB3286

0xC2C4949F
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0xEDF5BBD0

0xC2C4949F
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x11417E1A
moment's hesitation I answered--
0x937EF96B

0xC2C4949F
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x484D963B
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x16FFCB90

0xC2C4949F
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x9EEAC458
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x5C0B00D7
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x34943AE8
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x5A3B7902

0xC2C4949F
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0x552F9558
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x47773D8C
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0xA2312341
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0xE3C9627C
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0xCCA04C0C
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x4F00DBC2
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x0346C31F
plans.
0x7BB068B3

0xC2C4949F
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x9879F5E8
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0x9D7520F2
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x9A9F3B12
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0xB2412FB9
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0xB223BC57
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0x3B9A892F
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x2AA1739A
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0x39C6076D
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x7DC61062
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x8ACBCDD6
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x6C502B7D
the task without regard to the elements.
0x7212EE8D

0xC2C4949F
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xED60C0B5
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x3B32A88C
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x4C840118
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x808DDE92

0xC2C4949F
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x75296EAC
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0xF457B97E
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0xE7BF6985
was a special annoyance.
0x1C0F3905

0xC2C4949F
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0x05E7C683
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0xBC5321C0
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x073A8446
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x03D4DB1A
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x9F3CBAC5
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x3EC4826B
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x3712AC60
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x8E4795FA

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0xE07AF75C

0xC2C4949F
"Learning German."
0x019E3EE6

0xC2C4949F
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x4A6C1584

0xC2C4949F
"You are not in earnest?"
0xE6DCDECF

0xC2C4949F
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x9C50CF4C

0xC2C4949F
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0xBD307191
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0xB7374C52
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x8B4E965A
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x537FD434
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x2AB441C9
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xAABA5CDB
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0x3D866E04
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x1535B8CB
barely three months to his departure.
0x07C1ABA1

0xC2C4949F
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x6EB7CF76
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0x2005FEB5
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x6A395876
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x7D039973
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x574BD29C
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xF7B6AB87

0xC2C4949F
"I know it."
0x7A36B6FC

0xC2C4949F
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0xACB10409
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x7EE57E98
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x9503B568
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0xBC9FBF99
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x3DCAE966
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x23D0597B
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x88AE28AE
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x202D8880
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x9BAFE91B
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x3C14B533
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0xFEE479C0
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x8E147BAB

0xC2C4949F
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xBD12E9F5
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0xE7B9E712
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x41730923
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x479070D9
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x4892F660

0xC2C4949F
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0x360DCDBA
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x81B28437

0xC2C4949F
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x5219C58C
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x7B7AF062
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x42D19B5E
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x9F4D862F
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x4BDD5641
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x68EBBB53
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0x3F1927F6
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x196B5366
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x6713DA65
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0xB947BFA9
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x107B1A22
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x42733747

0xC2C4949F
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x48A7B03C
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x52C5023F
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0x67E5D31E
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0xC84AF065
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0xC2AF0202
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0xA2F649B1
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0xB5C31113
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0xF60CE5DC
own.
0x12BB5FFB

0xC2C4949F
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x4D35A03F
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0xB8E60989
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0xCEEF177A

0xC2C4949F
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0xDE47134D
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xC08C38BC
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0xBFB0CAF1
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x83686E95
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0xA3C33FC3
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0xC8156B1E
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x2B3F74CD
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x9384E8C3

0xC2C4949F
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0xCE0440D6
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0xDA0EFDC3
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0xCAE3E609
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x38E7A1C4
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0xE8EE5D01
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0xBA1DBF5B
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x87C78B36
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0x9CD187EA
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0xCD2E5071

0xC2C4949F
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x77C0BBB8
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xE3E214CE
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x63670004
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x79A8E135
then I felt dark indeed.
0xE741A0CA

0xC2C4949F
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x8BCDAF9E
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x39873A93
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0x0BBA9499
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x3FFD9613
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0xCA7A510B
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x042E23EC
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0xC406ED5E
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0x204FAB19

0xC2C4949F
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x4C58074B
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x1EF9EEAA
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0xB0ED3A81
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x27941D2F
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0xB4C8D650
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x38E5A3F5
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0xB54FBE08
eyes filled again.
0xA5A6DBF6

0xC2C4949F
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0x571BF93F
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xB5F21786
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0xD287AAF0
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x73CFE7D0
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0x5966BA25
as to its cause; he only said--
0xF8C4CB64

0xC2C4949F
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x5EBDCEBA
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0xEC7AF6A3
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x36B4EC25
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0xD90C00D6
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xEDBC3B44
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0x89FB3AC6
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xC3B03402
said--
0xD489085A

0xC2C4949F
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xD08FD282

0xC2C4949F
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0xB2397207

0xC2C4949F
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x59A86FC2
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xCB824795
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x87568B38

0xC2C4949F
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x66CA8C4D
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xBF6B5AE5
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x3D9914D4
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xF2B14909
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0x5CC1F270
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0x400041B5
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0xB5876DA4
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0xD8A52CED

0xC2C4949F
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x69F170C6
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0xA108716E
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xF188CF35
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0x5DAFFDC5
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x8E27F3FB
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0xEAB6A452
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x9E5AC17A
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x93295A40

0xC2C4949F
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x3F8F2861
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x1B0D6CBC
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0xF829561A
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0xF63D7A70
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x2D19DB3E
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x24635BBD
last refuge for silence.
0x6D714BC9

0xC2C4949F
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x98F23DC6
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x846BD822
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x91FA3F9C
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0xA784F229
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0xF39DA6F6

0xC2C4949F
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0xE8B2206A
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x55A897F6
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0x2E73FFA8

0xC2C4949F
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xF384E32B
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x289E1772
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0xE2803A8E

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0xA29E70BE
sails on the 20th of June."
0xA2484CC3

0xC2C4949F
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0xA726FC48

0xC2C4949F
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x142023E5
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0x32EE7972
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x4D7B3798
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0x589E4729
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x6C23C376
same enterprise."
0x53C21BCF

0xC2C4949F
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0x23E9EA73
to march with the strong."
0x613B9A00

0xC2C4949F
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x83BEC276
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0x5324FF6A

0xC2C4949F
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0x5C0E6922

0xC2C4949F
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0xB0DE32FD
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x73B698DC
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0x7431F32B
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0xCAC5FA62

0xC2C4949F
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0x69E1CC73
the first to inform them of it?"
0xBD0FD365

0xC2C4949F
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0xD5BF6B33
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0x34F1D255
rivet the spell.
0xFAA6CBD3

0xC2C4949F
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0xCBCDFB5D

0xC2C4949F
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0x969218BE

0xC2C4949F
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0xD98B0CEE
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0xC984AFD1

0xC2C4949F
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0xCC9EEFCA
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x9D75C63C
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0xBE5244C1
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x72296A9C

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0x2E2AF1CE

0xC2C4949F
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0xFDCE2F0C
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0xE85BF9E6

0xC2C4949F
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x45803E4A
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0xB2830445
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x42886E82
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0x1880DF21
service."
0x84CCD666

0xC2C4949F
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0xD1D29987

0xC2C4949F
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0x02A5AC5A
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0xD48CA159
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x00C9F9E2
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x5FBE1D3C
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0xAA00FFB3
for him.
0x6BBD0B2A

0xC2C4949F
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0xDC2EBCA2
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x1DEA5E88
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x01BEB3DD
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x3044E15C
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0xE3087818
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x5FE4D5C7
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0xBB2094DE
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x4CFBFCD3
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0xEA259FF3
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0xDA7DFD70
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0xFFDA92D0

0xC2C4949F
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0x66277FB9
labours."
0xBB6D6B2E

0xC2C4949F
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0x5DCF01BC
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x607B17B0
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0x2299A64A
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0xBCCF9550

0xC2C4949F
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0x9D43A65F
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0x75FE3A81
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0x771FC233
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0xF3DD07F1
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0x240836BB
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0x1C313606

0xC2C4949F
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xB5042373
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x020B2707
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x971F5BB8
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0xBAD6D0F0
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x427F49A1
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x9933695C
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0x898A02AF
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x036EA552
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x0E1D1A61
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x4B43B3AB
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0x02C4EED8
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x72DC78E3
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0x9D7E6983
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xDFD5693A
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x779B8348
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xA2FEEF9A
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0x719E8F36
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0x91263887
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0xF4CFB030
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0xD51BB634
be to me invaluable."
0x83E594EC

0xC2C4949F
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x2DEC47DC
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x6DE01693
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x6972ABE0
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0x7046955C
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0x0E12F7B8
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x763CF66B
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0x2B646292

0xC2C4949F
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0x3AC75E88
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0x3DEDE966

0xC2C4949F
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:
0x65E1782E

0xC53C48E1

0xC2C4949F
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x297D7B27
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x9762D9F3
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x0C97DC8A
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x45D70428
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x8A24A275
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x6CE8AB63
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0xEFF00A9B
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x6ED268E1
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x42605381
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x98DF4E8B
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0x140A716C
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0xE4F8FE5A
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x6B879E6D
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0xCEF22AC4
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0x22A96EEA
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0xA641D824
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0xD4B25D87
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x0A8CA8C0
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x540A95CE
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0xA4EBA5E2
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x93E67288
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0xF5A9FD1E
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xC195A9AD
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x38290CB4
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x3636F7EA
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0x9824B0A9

0xC2C4949F
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0x2C3BF951
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x6CAC7114
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x10864C27
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x6D1082C0
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0xD485D5CA
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x53A9FFE6
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0x25218AF3
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0x35689BC9
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xFDAF582A
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x47D38AC2
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x0D9C7F8C
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xB7ADF27E
I will tell him so."
0x3C9B0BDA

0xC2C4949F
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x6D98EB78
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x46754F5F
his feet and approached me.
0xA8966782

0xC2C4949F
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0x7AAF556F

0xC2C4949F
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0x3E2BBA51

0xC2C4949F
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0xA2A94A33
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x56BA11A7

0xC2C4949F
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x678F6A23
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x0BBC5E77
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x90CB4831
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0xE02E7676
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x9B849DFE
sense will guide you."
0xE3A75EC3

0xC2C4949F
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0x921EAC24
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0xA2EA3D14
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xD86D7603
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0x78F10EEC
continue."
0x470A350D

0xC2C4949F
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0x7ECECDBA
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0x9E685B88
have said that."
0xFC384286

0xC2C4949F
"Conditionally."
0xD59C3593

0xC2C4949F
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0xAE8A25D1
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0xD64F38F4
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0x67AF56DB
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0xEB6E0FD0
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x5D053620
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0x95B7E08F
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x3016B9B4
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0xC88F7D5F
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x803BCB8F
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0x8E1A021E
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0x10CBEEE6

0xC2C4949F
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0xB3614747
my limbs.
0xB1768267

0xC2C4949F
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0xBF183C36

0xC2C4949F
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0x0F869E62
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0x3EDF6DC6
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0xB1C3087B

0xC2C4949F
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0x4433B373
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0xE9EDD21E
them he has no use: I retain them."
0xA162A0E4

0xC2C4949F
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0x47635948
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x4606AAAD
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0xFDBB77E2
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0xD53863C2

0xC2C4949F
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0x33119295

0xC2C4949F
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0xF7F58466
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0xF7F8A30B
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x8F8775C9
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0xAFE0001A
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0xDF8E41BB
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x6DDC1D4C
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0x58673578
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0xF251EB05
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0xB2B3A887
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x918C26B8
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0xE67A78A9
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x5E1CAF66
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xF118A583

0xC2C4949F
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x5C80AF67
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0xD86B7313

0xC2C4949F
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0xAB97CDF2
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0xB1ECDC85
this signify?"
0x4895F0E4

0xC2C4949F
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xF251ADBB
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x5C44D95C
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0xCBBEB286
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0xB3D2F702
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x6EC98759
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x13C8DA03
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x050985F7
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0xE5EC0AA8
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0xCCCDC1AC
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x7F654BD1
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x065D441D
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0x2F154B63
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0x003851D2

0xC2C4949F
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x5E0E6B01
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x5BCEB27D
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xB40F1DF5
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x111FE8EB
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0xBA5C795E
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x05D92CFF
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0xAD9A619D
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x04C6BBE3
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x34D9D4E2
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x3FBD672B
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x0631520C
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0x0CF60E1C
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x0D490FB0
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x8A371010
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0xA267D6ED
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x14E69E3D
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x75C43F36
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x8ECABE15
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0xEFA34252
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x21CB45F0
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x4912E71E
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x3EA1B84C

0xC2C4949F
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x5FBC3EED

0xC2C4949F
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x9A59E932

0xC2C4949F
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0xF074C899
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0x153B4FA6

0xC2C4949F
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0x2AA21887
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x603E531F
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x6B77512A
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0xE5168453
tribes--and unwed?"
0xF3E0E563

0xC2C4949F
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xBCD3419D
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x89B802C4
yourself."
0xCDA7B270

0xC2C4949F
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x14461A78
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x1921F1EA
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x3C5C344D
heart and--it would not do."
0x45AA1328

0xC2C4949F
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0x088500C0
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0xB073AEED
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x240D988E
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x7CDFCFC7
nothing more--don't fear."
0x91DB7FB8

0xC2C4949F
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x3F9F6D93
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0xE1CB1111
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x9C293516
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0xA80D9CA0
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xEBF1FFFA
eyes."
0x38D39298

0xC2C4949F
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x5002B6C7
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x9F5F10D9
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0x9BF9549F
offer it."
0x9011F1F4

0xC2C4949F
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0xBB2B7EF5
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0xA519C26C
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0xB11E0397

0xC2C4949F
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x5F329814
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x24DF29F6

0xC2C4949F
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0xAF58CBAE

0xC2C4949F
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0xB418BDC1
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0xF8604FA1
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0x1271B909
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x67B2C3CF
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x577E4DF7
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0xF2F78752

0xC2C4949F
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0xADFC3F84
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0xE5B680E6
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x3005E9C6
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0x05339984
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x5AF84E50
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0xD7CB27F6
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x761024DA
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xAFC1853A
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xCDB7935B
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xD415724A

0xC2C4949F
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0xF4A1970C

0xC2C4949F
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0xC2D63B1B

0xC2C4949F
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0xD53AC3A6
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xB55EB18C
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x76FDBFCB
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0xE971687D
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xF4C381E0
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0x8CF9151E
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x865F7192
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x47419634
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0x0718E0CC

0xC2C4949F
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0xD9A9C653
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x6675D18C
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x32C0F1E2
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0x4C960FCA

0xC2C4949F
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x7906053D
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0xD23BFE49
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0x4BD7F411

0xC2C4949F
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0xD5A9CF81
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0x443798FA
stairs.
0xDF3CE93A

0xC2C4949F
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0x9EFB1218

0xC2C4949F
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x0C810022

0xC2C4949F
"Then shake hands," I added.
0xA01C1F6F

0xC2C4949F
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0xD65C6DC1
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0xA20C7EAB
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x927A2501
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x37BD44C7
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xFEEBCFD6
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0xDCB377D8
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x13B11B39

0xC2C4949F
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0x3D3442C5
down.
0xC26B7C59

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXXV
0x5E643B0D

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0x3542269B
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0x2BFFADE9
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0xF56068E2
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0xB55D5131
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x5335C5F8
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x2072BDB1

0xC2C4949F
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0xB68ACD5C
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0xDF69921C
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x341C2864
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0xB83A838E
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x0BB26E3C
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x55F5B195
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x73C4D311
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0xC406E0CA
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x9F11CD82

0xC2C4949F
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x856B99D2
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0xCF15077D
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x54346ED0
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x1ECFBCB6
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0x0C2F81C2
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x5CDF7A62
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0xFFE314FF
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0x5FEF6F62
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x445CCBB9

0xC2C4949F
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x097ABFE3
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xE4C6EC03
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x7BEAA277
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0xD041576E
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0xC56FADC7
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0xD87C3BC3
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x15A87B07
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0x3C23D9F0
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x2664E41E
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x2335FBDF
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x72A7CC97
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x038C40A2
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0xAC02B94B
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0xE8A33EFC
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x423BBDC7

0xC2C4949F
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0xF71D95C0
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x46E8DF32
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x9B787C87
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0x65237911
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x3B5BA202
spoke to the point at once.
0x6445E93C

0xC2C4949F
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0xB53864A7
friends."
0x9C6756D9

0xC2C4949F
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0xF3638346
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0xAA75E5BB

0xC2C4949F
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0xB302A623

0xC2C4949F
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x68C4A4CD
good."
0xB76B9A58

0xC2C4949F
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0xCC7A3A0F
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x127244CB
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x6A1AE1B8
strangers."
0x4AD71592

0xC2C4949F
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x6EFFDD39
regarding you as a stranger."
0xB159ECC2

0xC2C4949F
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x4BE9D54B
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0xFC8ACA0B
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0xB561E6F4
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0xD71BA602
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x8771FC1A
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x4567B00C

0xC2C4949F
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x0D3A8F26
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0x590F31C3

0xC2C4949F
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0x33701F6D

0xC2C4949F
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0xC7493ADD
India?"
0x95D81967

0xC2C4949F
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xCFA732F2

0xC2C4949F
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0xCE53382D

0xC2C4949F
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x2BBF318B
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x88553D40
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x16EE45F4

0xC2C4949F
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x73C80FF0

0xC2C4949F
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0xDCF1DD75
crash down.
0x415BCCFD

0xC2C4949F
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0xC833EA2F

0xC2C4949F
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x8640CC55
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xE7C95502
You are killing me now."
0x690B189C

0xC2C4949F
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x844BA333

0xC2C4949F
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0xC093DB37
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x31A50A61
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0xF6D8E26F
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x32980E3B
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xA9480BBA

0xC2C4949F
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x23986BAA
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x9F5023C5
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0xF372E351

0xC2C4949F
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xA83A68DE
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x52F2E432

0xC2C4949F
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0x4C2F013C
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xCDCCECA6
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x2F9BDA58

0xC2C4949F
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0x3AA5CF3B
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0xFB016033

0xC2C4949F
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x78E628C9
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x43558BB6
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xB979CAB0

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0xF31C28A7

0xC2C4949F
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x148825A0
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x3125827F
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x3934B7A4
spoke at last.
0xAF5F9055

0xC2C4949F
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0x753212F7
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x4F220E6D
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x01332905
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x84AF6BE1
sake."
0x335DBB43

0xC2C4949F
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0xBEEDBB61
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0xF8F1D993
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0xE79B9CF4
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x989093FE
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x77C8F299
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0xAC1E5BDF

0xC2C4949F
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x1C007397
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0xA3C47FAF

0xC2C4949F
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x6376ADC0
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0xB5DA12BC
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x6EDDE70D
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0x24B7BAEA
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0xEFB2AFE6
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0xEEE370BA

0xC2C4949F
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xA7C23D95
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0xE366B285
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0xB88B2773

0xC2C4949F
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0xE35D0EFC
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x0DF1ECF7
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x775FDA77
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0xD73496BC
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xECDF4452

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x37718F81

0xC2C4949F
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x7A8FED98
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0xDF74652B
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0xEC36BE9C
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0x9B0FBC64
leaving it."
0x7529E885

0xC2C4949F
"What do you mean?"
0x016A3DB5

0xC2C4949F
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0xDDE920E0
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x9AF297B3
some means that doubt is removed."
0xD98BA4E6

0xC2C4949F
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x00755DA0
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0x4FBACFBB
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0xF8541581
Rochester?"
0xDAD7265C

0xC2C4949F
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xE8E3EF27

0xC2C4949F
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x8AAC2966

0xC2C4949F
"I must find out what is become of him."
0xE5063786

0xC2C4949F
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0xCE8FF879
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0xC82DF596
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x47043B8D
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0x6C2D4073

0xC2C4949F
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xC35F3FCF
was soon out of sight.
0xA26DA0D5

0xC2C4949F
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xB886FC24
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x06829BF3
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x1B7BC1F9

0xC2C4949F
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0xACA8E5CC
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0xABE6089B
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0xE7C0F5C5
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x80B59415
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x16B4C9B5

0xC2C4949F
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xD9D24068

0xC2C4949F
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x8AA81A38
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x13DDBE61
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0xA1B3BEAF
Jane?"
0x7C390F10

0xC2C4949F
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0xE53B434E

0xC2C4949F
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0x9E75E77F
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0xB9E5E05A
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x916BDDAD

0xC2C4949F
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x6F6DA025

0xC2C4949F
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0xE83BEF5A
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x7BF1D751

0xC2C4949F
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0x2603D55B
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x217A77BD

0xC2C4949F
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0xEE824830

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x97CF1298
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x5938459D

0xC2C4949F
"I have refused to marry him--"
0x83CEDE98

0xC2C4949F
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x9D0B451A

0xC2C4949F
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x64D52799
as his sister."
0x80D6A6AF

0xC2C4949F
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0xA3669CCA
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0xB91A49A7
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0x35EB191B
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xA495CCC4
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x27BAE2C3
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x82B37684
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x785B6A36

0xC2C4949F
"Not as a husband."
0x3F26ACA7

0xC2C4949F
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0xD7B2CF83

0xC2C4949F
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x2AE2F0BF

0xC2C4949F
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x5C00FEB2
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0xDFD4804F
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0xDBE6F1D0

0xC2C4949F
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0x6D75EB0B
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0xFC02DA25
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0xCB7200B0
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0xE2824A81
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0x0A3E78BC

0xC2C4949F
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0x5382CEEA

0xC2C4949F
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x483963E8
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x95735D9D
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0x2DC93F4C
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0xF89730C9
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x4FACFAF5
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0xCCD7A8D9

0xC2C4949F
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0x8297DCFE

0xC2C4949F
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0xB992A055
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x8965AC9D
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0xC31726F2
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x5DBB75EC
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x956E3FFB
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x8D6B802E
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xECC8EB5D
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x8A16A1B5

0xC2C4949F
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x2D716ABE

0xC2C4949F
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0xAF0D41BE
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0x60DD60D4
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0xB22E082A
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0xE574C174
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x95993FF0

0xC2C4949F
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x567607D0
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x7106F9E3
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0xE9960CB9
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0xA9E82A2A
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x1C3C1185
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0xDD5D4304
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x44B34468
had forgiven me once more.
0x8C36D460

0xC2C4949F
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0xFE113BE6
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0x64C46762
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x81FC8C93
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x326183A8
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0xC25F90C6
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x3D27C811
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0xADB1360D
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0xBF0A62FD
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0xE0B8CA9B
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xB3B31ABF
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0xAAF942BB
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x03B9892F
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0x82939501
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x180528D0

0xC2C4949F
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x2D6FB867
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0xE26ABAD3
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0xD1AFD696

0xC2C4949F
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0xDD38B3F1
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x0E64C0C7
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x5952C1FC
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0xFF29D914

0xC2C4949F
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0x21CAFD67

0xC2C4949F
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0x0A6E0352
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x72536258
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x78B01BE2
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xA9AB0B82
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x59C6B47D
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x3E677667
Lamb is the light thereof.
0x49D66905

0xC2C4949F
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0xB1F16B60
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0xC99F7350
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x090127C3
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x902E5E70
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x816E0871
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x26F55402
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x34D34C6A
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0xEBB9B4B3
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0xE25E0A33
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x90EFEF95
could not but feel it too.
0xE2F241F2

0xC2C4949F
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x7D4AEC1D
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x37FC4F34
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0xAC25EDEA
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0xEF008DD3

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0xEB7E1DA5
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x937D8F66
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x54369975
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x52352389
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x2A1088B7
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x510D1C97
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x16C9303D
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0xF33BAD3C
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0xDA6E8D78
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xEA5F7FCE
from you!"
0x1F1D7A66

0xC2C4949F
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0xEF09CC9C
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0xA7259060
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x898E45DA
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x47DD493D
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x7743FE96
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0xA2F95356
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0x0D980F0B
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x3F16C8D6
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x4F2D673E
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x815D115E
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xEF0942A3
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x91223525
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x5B90E856
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x86CD82B2
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x6A9B2AFC
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x48F990AF

0xC2C4949F
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0xDB2AFD41
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0xA762E5C7
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x084B2425
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x031004C6
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x72FFAC9A
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xC198C3BC
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x19A277D9
dim room was full of visions.
0x3E6B88D4

0xC2C4949F
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0xBF0A8D9E
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0x918372D3
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x088EEFD2
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0xD85F6DAF
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x62D0BE39
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xA2FDC315
prayer: it was only elevated.
0x321DB1B4

0xC2C4949F
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0xDDAA0498
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x6EE4BB9A
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xC501F28A

0xC2C4949F
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0x7DF2564A
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x37DA830D
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x935A10A3
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0xDF29887F
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0xB2E3BD7B
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0xF29CB8C3
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0xC81A15C0
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0xE4C749B1
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x615E5324
shall judge.
0xB6DFBCC7

0xC2C4949F
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0xFA04F58A
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0xA884E1AC
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xF0C4DBDE
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x16D56A29
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x1CECB072
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0xDA73BE3D
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x13AEFCD7
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x89CCBC2A
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x50930197
bones.
0x431A5CAE

0xC2C4949F
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x28DD4ACC
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x935D0609

0xC2C4949F
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x3F35A97A

0xC2C4949F
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0x8A250378

0xC2C4949F
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0xED9FC845
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x655EF6A3
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x30931877
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xFD8AE7BD
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x6691859B
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x876D1E58

0xC2C4949F
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0xEE807996
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x21094F5E
garden: it was void.
0x0DE6E098

0xC2C4949F
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x6892E7B2

0xC2C4949F
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0xBAD54AED
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0xE07B3C1B
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x957D9BA9

0xC2C4949F
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0xA5213CC5
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xBF532433
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0x01ACDD09
best."
0x97803376

0xC2C4949F
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0xFA3E0608
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0xD7B3E1AB
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x63F2B788
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x91B8579E
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0xC55B428C
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0xE58FE219
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0x2B9A41B3
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0xB4925653
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0xECE91F0D
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

CHAPTER XXXVI
0x421FFFC8

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0xA0C09C0A
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0xBA72DF90
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x8F3132A6
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x16D1A970
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0xACF809CF
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x7A5AA860

0xC2C4949F
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x9FEF34D4
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xD0377792
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0xA6371575
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0xED6659A2
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x8103E2DD
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x3414E2B4

0xC2C4949F
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0xF2AA0717
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x8BC0EE85
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0x7A731B54
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x87FFF009
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xCB7C9631

0xC2C4949F
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0x8D56B0D8
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x2CDB697C
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0xFC09177F
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x1AC7EB7B
would meet the coach.
0x427BCFED

0xC2C4949F
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x1AA54D76
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xAB2742E3
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0x4DE0B066

0xC2C4949F
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x96B9B160
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x4F22AD03
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0xFC5B9089
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x7DE875AF
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x5B5DD019
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x91084912
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0xD7889ED7
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0xED65B6B0
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0x1AD9A8D7
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x13ABB80F
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x8A27FF3F
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x63A970F9
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0xDC63B074
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0x97D302E7
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x657701D4
body.
0x4E71AC19

0xC2C4949F
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0xE3B37A8F
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0xF8089F34
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x936D7EF8

0xC2C4949F
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0xA6138872
and should be absent at least four days.
0xDA7907C6

0xC2C4949F
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x1B58AB24

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x20354438
time been uneasy."
0x21568278

0xC2C4949F
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x3F9DB824
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x0526079D
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0xEBF75429
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xBC5B112B
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0xADB50A03
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x339E049F

0xC2C4949F
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x9ACA7D57
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x03E58EC7
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0xD8394F8A
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x9F82235E
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x4EB88C3F

0xC2C4949F
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0xAD81DEB8
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x3635D33D
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x5D488CC9
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0xF40F995B
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0xEEC1593F
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0xDDE2FB7E
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x9CB2517E
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0xC4D39D45
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x3E48BD11

0xC2C4949F
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0x0745062C
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0xF33F7EEF
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0xDB210822
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x05F40B87
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0x1F40FF4E
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0xB60F0C68
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x16B7ADA1
we were near my bourne.
0x67A0E5DF

0xC2C4949F
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0x84F122E5

0xC2C4949F
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x5D66448F

0xC2C4949F
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x78FC2BAF
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0xEF9DE19A
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0x7C9343B2
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x2265AEFF
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0xD64DE40A
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0x8E69D586

0xC2C4949F
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0xBE371789
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0xF236FA41
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x184C8233
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0xF6DE6D4C
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x77BBECE0
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xD9A93CB7
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0xCB63F309
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0xD6B7BEF3

0xC2C4949F
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x2173BFFD
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0x79F012EE
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x66975A07
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xC3738C8C
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x87841683
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0x1B581299
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x5D9C2793
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0xFE20A9CD
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x6EF79905
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x8374D1F0
them!
0xA31E4E26

0xC2C4949F
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0xD476D84E
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x2C95E112
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x37658D17
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x4D8DB997
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xA1F8D6A5
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x5DEEAECF
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x5FCA53C4
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0xA5652F68
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x98ED3FA6
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x2359648B
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0xA7359D89
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x87307B0D
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0x7CC48E1A
tideless sea of the south."
0x26DCBD67

0xC2C4949F
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0xEAC50032
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x6C1FD7B9
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x93038AD8
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x4043B478
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x23930F59
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x048B6A1D
station were at my command.
0x721AA4F7

0xC2C4949F
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xD56CC10F
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x68467030
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x1EE284D8
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x92C84CD9
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x24027DC9
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xAA80A247
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0xCF73B5AE
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x8E9A97A0

0xC2C4949F
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x8D04DF70

0xC2C4949F
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x1E4A4216
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0x5E173C57
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x0101C44C
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0x59894360
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0x89BBE67C
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x5D7B4333
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x9C102E0D
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x26ECBB12
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x1F0B2711
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0xC4586204
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x7E056CA6
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x7FCCBEA2
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x87D6F27F

0xC2C4949F
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0x95FC1A81
ruin.
0x5577D4D6

0xC2C4949F
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0xC1DE26CD
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x51174CF0
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x277A99FF
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x7482CAD0
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x388D85F4
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0xD66C7004
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x43014A8D

0xC2C4949F
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x373DB79A
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0xA2F98567
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0x8BA68EDC
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x1997049D
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xD686DF09
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x047D9BF5
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0xC8385AC4
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x195AA491
token.
0x4AC0F5AC

0xC2C4949F
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0xA6F0A0B6
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x4D335669
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0xAD775158
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x2D153A00
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x442C18B6
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x5A5154B0
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x2FD0A4B6
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x1A3902B3
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x322B47E2
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0xCA54AF5F

0xC2C4949F
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x899FC953
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x4BB8C49A
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0x4635149E
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0x15197768
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x077BCF30
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x429FC5B7
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x90FCFA06

0xC2C4949F
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x3849E97B

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0xE28D8AE1

0xC2C4949F
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0x4738EFC3

0xC2C4949F
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0xFDE9A6CA

0xC2C4949F
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0xF1AEA751
trying to evade.
0xB63C9D91

0xC2C4949F
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0xD8A29DE9

0xC2C4949F
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xD7C3EA05
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x1EBDCCE2
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0xADADF12B
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x155C2BF1
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x46C5A332
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xDAE4BCD4
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0xBCB61557
Antipodes.
0x5A8E17BE

0xC2C4949F
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x5E43EB84
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x3219C141
direct question as to where he really was.
0x3746E7E5

0xC2C4949F
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x84717987
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0xBDC2AE27
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0xE620FC5D
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xF86C3242
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xBAFFA3C6
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0x4B02FC35
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0xBEE93AA7
witnessed it myself."
0xDEB2B0A5

0xC2C4949F
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x1D3BB059
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x565390C0

0xC2C4949F
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x42A8CF3E
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x42E03264
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x5EB2675B
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0xD9DD4B94

0xC2C4949F
"I have heard something of it."
0x1B7A0742

0xC2C4949F
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x178EDA94
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x107BEA4F
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0xC5444081
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x0192A903
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xD04D63C8
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0xCA7CB52C

0xC2C4949F
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x4BBC6701
main fact.
0x401C2341

0xC2C4949F
"And this lady?"
0x6CB88E57

0xC2C4949F
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0x0506DD8F
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0x0D7D7B84
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x7D9250B1

0xC2C4949F
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x851D4D9A

0xC2C4949F
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x501C717B
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x184659D7
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0x5DF2C636
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xE041A00A
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0xF5FC12D3
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x7E44EC7F
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0xCC9B7CD8
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x37485D06
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xE49E5F76
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x261066B7

0xC2C4949F
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xA881EB3D
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x2F65AB40
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xCFA4CFB4

0xC2C4949F
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x9A314B4B
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x1655221C
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0xE9A6B290
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x3A8D3C91
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x501EBDCD
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0xFF8CCBEA
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0xBC4D5A48
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0xCD4BC069
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0xA3E67DAF
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x3311DB70
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0x39CF4EF2
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xAD3ADCC2
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x85633906
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0xA0ED7BD7
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x25596DB0
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0xC8147678
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x300CB0E9
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0xB6CCFBBD
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x47745BD5
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x1C0E2D17
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x70E1FF55
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x6C070C24
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x1CA3CF1F
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x9EB57307
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xDB433A39
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0xC5E7D214

0xC2C4949F
"What! did he not leave England?"
0x32BBF97C

0xC2C4949F
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x172EE4D4
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xBB9F1A81
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x1E59DA6E
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0xB522EC6E
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x71F5F9F1
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x4DD330F5
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x7EFBE57B
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0xFB82252D
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xF3E38D8E
Thornfield Hall."
0x699466AD

0xC2C4949F
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0x2CEFB6A4

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x52207FEA
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0xA5330757
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xE2D3EBEE
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0xAF40FAF2
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x5D8128F9
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0xA433B333
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x0BBDF6BD
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0x9EAFC733
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0x0FBAE39B
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0xAB516852
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0xD5F2A23E
pavement."
0x68DA2C62

0xC2C4949F
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0x10000516

0xC2C4949F
"Dead?"
0x724DCEF6

0xC2C4949F
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x5580FCE7
scattered."
0x440C0F78

0xC2C4949F
"Good God!"
0x8057FBEE

0xC2C4949F
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0x03B7AC9F

0xC2C4949F
He shuddered.
0xB3E38984

0xC2C4949F
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0x2011AC42

0xC2C4949F
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0xE95C3067
only some bits of walls standing now."
0x2635206D

0xC2C4949F
"Were any other lives lost?"
0xF7977E7C

0xC2C4949F
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0xDFBB8630

0xC2C4949F
"What do you mean?"
0x016A3DB5

0xC2C4949F
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0x06881DD2
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0xF5701B52
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x4BF57784
pity him, for my part."
0x7B6859DD

0xC2C4949F
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0xD3EF2BB1

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x59CFD1ED

0xC2C4949F
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0x63427339
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x1335DB83

0xC2C4949F
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0xDE1993C7
fixture now."
0xE0978AC1

0xC2C4949F
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0x8B404363

0xC2C4949F
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0xCF4339BB
Edward."
0xF900C0E3

0xC2C4949F
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0xF254AC68
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x98FF07C1

0xC2C4949F
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0xB1C9DFD9
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x99C5F059
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0xE09971C1
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x02BF7BD5
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0x725066CA
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0xC2CB6300
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x1061DEFB
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x4265D3CC
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0xD0E86546

0xC2C4949F
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0xD059DB09

0xC2C4949F
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0x35F3B281
quite a desolate spot."
0xC1FAD536

0xC2C4949F
"Who is with him?"
0x562B4A19

0xC2C4949F
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0xAE694281
down, they say."
0x4EEE4744

0xC2C4949F
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x27903DFB

0xC2C4949F
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0x98BE0DBF

0xC2C4949F
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0xAFE80D04
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0x4102C109
you usually demand."

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXXVII
0x6CE51704

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0xCECDBB5A
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xE175F247
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x885A4C16
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0xB50173B1
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x12271D87
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x5B0FC2BC
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x32C12E72
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x8A82B534
there in the season to shoot.
0xC2717849

0xC2C4949F
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0x285F8B29
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x0DC3B917
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x7E835414
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0xB11BC531
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0x95C7E592
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0xB0418CB6
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x35675C3E
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0x465B5544
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x18801E07
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0x316FB35E
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xE2451C30
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x7A613640

0xC2C4949F
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0xC6B9C143
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x5BDC148E
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x04695042
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0xD2ADAD2D

0xC2C4949F
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x28A7DD7C
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xC23425E8
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0xB20F0798
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x4B9C05AF
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x222254CC
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0xE7C3EB8F
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x19AD5579
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x43ABE731
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0xC7F9CBB0
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0xED8172F8
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0xB282DFB6
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0x836236BB

0xC2C4949F
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xAB8EDC6A

0xC2C4949F
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x1C596B2B
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xA500D8AD
grange.
0xC00CCCB7

0xC2C4949F
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0x296C08DB
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x5428A9CD
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0xDCC6AB87
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0xB67329BF

0xC2C4949F
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xE399854C
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x0B0B8247
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0xB308A1F4
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x328E27BF
advance.
0x2611B7E6

0xC2C4949F
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xBC19E1A0
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x791AD601
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xDF35F8E4
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x19C365FA
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x657DC559
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0xD2B778C7
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x7B69838C
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x776B1E55

0xC2C4949F
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x5FBC3417
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0xF55D8D2E
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x16504122
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x44A5293F

0xC2C4949F
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xBBECFA33
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x23A9A871
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xBB29B2CE
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0xEAD33758
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x70532E50
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0xE1092CF9
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0xD28D8DD9
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x44685C02
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0xEBC5EE1D
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0x9E45296D
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x8CA83C8A

0xC2C4949F
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xCBB600E6
had you not better go in?"
0x537AA277

0xC2C4949F
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0xA697E431

0xC2C4949F
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x175467C3
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0x5F02F38B
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0xE39F5D5F

0xC2C4949F
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0xC7704260
"how are you?"
0xC6E68B0E

0xC2C4949F
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x956B690E
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0xF1DB1E9B
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x1312477F
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x08C6C095
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0xCF4E7F40
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x6053A356
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0xB509BCC2
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x46BBEDB2
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x4E4EB1A8
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x1F817211
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0xD2C10C9D
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0xE604ECD5

0xC2C4949F
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xDE6F842B
to him, but do not give my name."
0x65C4A7CF

0xC2C4949F
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xBE82E5FE

0xC2C4949F
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0xFEB40938
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0xD1D68A58
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0xC805F9CD

0xC2C4949F
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xED2EB009

0xC2C4949F
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x082826C3

0xC2C4949F
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0xDA2597D2

0xC2C4949F
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x7445C572
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x81D888C8
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0xB5910357

0xC2C4949F
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x6A163F6C
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0xD3C9C698
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x8AF3D9E5
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x31B803B7
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x02101A42
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x63F53AF5
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x39F066E2
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0xBD0E0908
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x22B44A2E
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0xD5809B91

0xC2C4949F
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0xAC7E820A

0xC2C4949F
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x30EDD117
still excited.
0xBE580FC7

0xC2C4949F
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0xBBA7A06A

0xC2C4949F
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x271AE157
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x4A3A82B8
you, Mary, is it not?"
0xB151EA45

0xC2C4949F
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0xC2E5B2C5

0xC2C4949F
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x9C53A589
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0xDB204D54
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x5492445A
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0xAECE61E9
and aloud.
0xCC61BD1F

0xC2C4949F
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x13C6F8F2
glass," I said.
0xDC546D2E

0xC2C4949F
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0xA64C627B

0xC2C4949F
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x64EE74F1
evening," I answered.
0xDDE6FC6A

0xC2C4949F
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0xD320F043
seized me?"
0xF91768A6

0xC2C4949F
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x1619B9ED
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x36D51765

0xC2C4949F
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x607E3E5C
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0xEDC698A9
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0xC802750E

0xC2C4949F
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x7C67BBF1

0xC2C4949F
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x6620B0D7
must be more of her."
0x2587B7DC

0xC2C4949F
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xFD492EAE
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0x8AF9DAF7

0xC2C4949F
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0xB1C3CCA0

0xC2C4949F
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0xFB32F5DD
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x6819B58C

0xC2C4949F
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x97113069

0xC2C4949F
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xD98D1A7E
come back to you."
0xF612734F

0xC2C4949F
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xD3B5A9C9

0xC2C4949F
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0xE5EF3D23
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x6A652AFA

0xC2C4949F
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0xCCEC6698
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x0D5EA653
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xC9C642BB
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x424B116B
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x685429EA

0xC2C4949F
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0xD2524774

0xC2C4949F
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0xB75F28DE
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x420A34E2
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0x283FF7A5
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xD7ABB1F1
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x3AECF1CF
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0x0F0B801A

0xC2C4949F
"There, sir--and there!"'
0xFC8216CD

0xC2C4949F
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x033A3E25
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xD1B78DB7
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x235DBD22

0xC2C4949F
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0xDEF9BF2A

0xC2C4949F
"I am."
0xB4ABD1EE

0xC2C4949F
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0xDE916B14
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x6E87FB95

0xC2C4949F
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0x5586F9D0

0xC2C4949F
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0xD29699CA

0xC2C4949F
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0x63530B8F

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0xF7688783
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0xB01E9612
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x372DB627
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x755198E1

0xC2C4949F
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0xD08D659F
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0x62C0CA36
company of an evening."
0x7F5CF803

0xC2C4949F
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0x8F94976E
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0xC1319A6D
me?"
0xFE39FFA7

0xC2C4949F
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x511BC27F
mistress."
0x654B351C

0xC2C4949F
"And you will stay with me?"
0x5708AA94

0xC2C4949F
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x4B9675CC
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0xD39A6829
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0x74D277CD
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x987A881A
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x20B331B7

0xC2C4949F
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xA9502098
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0x141FD18A
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0x3A6F8C0F
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0xFCEEF51A
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0xDC739C79
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xDA9C7B56
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0xB21217D6
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x935B055A
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0xA9528341
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x2608F0D9
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x859CA371

0xC2C4949F
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x40381AD9
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x68F9C4D9
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x704C5F4A
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0x572F501C
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x83438026
vengeance on its frame."
0xC4A71E54

0xC2C4949F
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0x260F724B

0xC2C4949F
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x5A4FA570
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x6449492F
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x317B63AE
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x9BA4AE79
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0xD0B1FE10
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0xCB1DD872
Come--tell me."
0xAA8A6E9D

0xC2C4949F
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0xBF59A56F
you think it better."
0x301A04D6

0xC2C4949F
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x38620B26
one day."
0xCAB20496

0xC2C4949F
"I don't care about being married."
0xCC13E001

0xC2C4949F
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0xF6BB6075
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x3BC8E335

0xC2C4949F
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x2C693EDF
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0x943EDE38
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x8C90718A
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x0449A83E
conversation.
0x47D02ABD

0xC2C4949F
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0x42A46C8E
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x2C659C41
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x3C6142F3
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xD4551195
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x5CB1EA76
not yet noticed."
0x16A32C09

0xC2C4949F
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x9F713F55
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xEA1819CA
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0xC5C497AA

0xC2C4949F
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x132FDACF
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x7802F5EC
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0x10B8EDE3

0xC2C4949F
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x95E87C82
cicatrised visage."
0x08CA9E31

0xC2C4949F
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x7B375D9A
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x9CAE8A8B
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0x8FB92E09

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0xFB3F1FC8

0xC2C4949F
"And you see the candles?"
0xAF7AB053

0xC2C4949F
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0x3D85FF22

0xC2C4949F
"Can you see me?"
0x2520FBE0

0xC2C4949F
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0xB9B94489

0xC2C4949F
"When do you take supper?"
0xD9992281

0xC2C4949F
"I never take supper."
0xD3527715

0xC2C4949F
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0x2F197481
only you forget."
0xB4766EE8

0xC2C4949F
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x621E9AC8
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0x9CE4CD38
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x44F00662
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0x72A7B373
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xA7F70C12
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0xD5B0B368
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xE60031D2
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x30C980AA
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xF6259055
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xEAD945E6

0xC2C4949F
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0xB8645B23
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x2F038C62
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x0928F76C
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0xCA2E0466
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0xA9E1D22C
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0x348C2A5C
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0xDAB91C32

0xC2C4949F
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0x5EC79B93

0xC2C4949F
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0x87E097FD
p422.jpg}
0x70B94012

0xC2C4949F
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0xA3CA3042

0xC2C4949F
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0x06F294C2
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0x7768D196
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0xC9F71D28
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x997F2A0B

0xC2C4949F
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0xA8CF2EE6

0xC2C4949F
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0x4D27827A
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x424A5D2A
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0xF03D50C1
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0x2ABD06C9
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x1471A70F
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xB56E631C
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x6A78CCF1
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x6055C20F
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0x0C6A6A0D

0xC2C4949F
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x3DA9D377
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0xD54457E8
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xAE24A04D
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x600ADBDD
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0xFD36755D

0xC2C4949F
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0x14F59AA1
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0xC8DD9B60
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0x71DCE4B7
undiscoverable?
0x93AB52AF

0xC2C4949F
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0x5F682704

0xC2C4949F
"What for, Jane?"
0x6A8F0CCC

0xC2C4949F
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0xD5515559
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x3E299C65
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x87FD0F88

0xC2C4949F
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0xC233A931

0xC2C4949F
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x7C48DF17

0xC2C4949F
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0x5EFCA2D6
sojourned."
0xC4DFAB59

0xC2C4949F
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0xEFF753FB
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0x41D9692E
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0x842A977A

0xC2C4949F
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0x4D5BE342

0xC2C4949F
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0xF5D57AB8
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0xD3073155
substantiality."
0x2D5CD6D3

0xC2C4949F
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x60993EC5

0xC2C4949F
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0x3A80F538
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0x4E00EB31
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x7836475F
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0xD08AD4F3
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0xF3282461
ham."
0xBF78410F

0xC2C4949F
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0x79815D8D
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0x041BAEFC
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0x88BFD290
harp."
0x1DC24BD9

0xC2C4949F
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x3429E639
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xC91941CC
night."
0x0908DFDE

0xC2C4949F
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x8898C392
been?"
0x3FF0A156

0xC2C4949F
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0xAAAAD801
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0x254C36CB
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0xA667FFDB

0xC2C4949F
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0xF90E8FC3
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x368FC583
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0x053A6F3F
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0xF9DC8FF9

0xC2C4949F
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x4296097E
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x4A871FE7
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x0AA59E7C
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x02680700
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0xFCF45041
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x94C447D6
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0xA843CEBC
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x875B9649
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0xACA83C99
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x66908E19
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x0F01F9FF

0xC2C4949F
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x70163BE3
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0xB16AFC4C
soon."
0xC9EAAEB0

0xC2C4949F
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x71F9D07F

0xC2C4949F
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0xD7ECA689
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xCE6E3FF3
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x19ECB632
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x85A2C43D
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0xBE909034
can feel is in her presence."
0x381D3CA4

0xC2C4949F
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x791236FB
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0xFC6A4206
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x211BCEC9
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0xED46F678

0xC2C4949F
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0xF3FA299C
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x3DE8259E
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0xF2DB671E
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x91EB22CE
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0xC66F723F
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xB4693318
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0xCE95A5E9
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x29F19159

0xC2C4949F
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x0114FD50
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x7AEE27E1
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x21F58C49
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0xF4292B66
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x8E43053A
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x103177EC
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0xA2247870
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xDCD6ADD9

0xC2C4949F
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x542A0C89
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x36B0BCE9
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x1A318C7C
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x142EA293
deeper than I wished.
0x5DE285FB

0xC2C4949F
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x90AC8236
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x38E88372
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x109DF9C2
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x662E0833
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0xCA0B3541
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x3E5BCED1
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0xF113EFAD
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x1ADE6F75

0xC2C4949F
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0xF9F4945C
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x127982E8
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x6AA3F19C
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x05989191
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xC5768E6F
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x49E52426
up.
0x34D4738C

0xC2C4949F
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0x131BBBB7

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0x909DE9FC

0xC2C4949F
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0x808DB91D

0xC2C4949F
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0xAF4FDA1C
Or what does it mean?"
0x3CDB2659

0xC2C4949F
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0xF83EE5C2

0xC2C4949F
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x67771A54
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x8923798D
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0x1D273B14

0xC2C4949F
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0xB9553DCC
perform."
0xA9EC03F5

0xC2C4949F
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x718BB43B
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0xE0844BF2

0xC2C4949F
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0xC8029915
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0xA5D7B0B1

0xC2C4949F
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x24C62519

0xC2C4949F
"Truly able."
0x68BE6801

0xC2C4949F
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0xDDADAE2A

0xC2C4949F
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0xCB26E521

0xC2C4949F
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0xDBC747C0
parsonic?"
0xBABB4591

0xC2C4949F
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0x913CA650
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x5025E189

0xC2C4949F
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x4BA02CEF
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0xB82757B6
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x5C5A7146

0xC2C4949F
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0xE8D55FB8
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0x3E45A032

0xC2C4949F
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0xEE008609

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0xF4875457

0xC2C4949F
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x038290D6
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x0964AAF8
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x9388A339
immediately charm the snake.
0x5F93F4BE

0xC2C4949F
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x9F8C232D
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0xD13D2561

0xC2C4949F
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0x3EB851AD

0xC2C4949F
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xDBFC0390
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x845E4683
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x9A1424CE
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x106D25BD
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x4E1AFA78
bargain."
0x06605D2C

0xC2C4949F
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0xBEBA1727
sir."
0x638DD22A

0xC2C4949F
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0x23D273CA
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0xA02A69A4
question or two."  He paused.
0x8F1674C7

0xC2C4949F
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0x7C9AE2D7

0xC2C4949F
Then followed this cross-examination.
0xD9961D85

0xC2C4949F
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x341C3B61
cousin?"
0xBB9A22AD

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0x09C0981A

0xC2C4949F
"Daily."
0xA0C753C0

0xC2C4949F
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0xFCE447B1
you are a talented creature!"
0x836D6AD9

0xC2C4949F
"He approved of them--yes."
0xC661CBF0

0xC2C4949F
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0x60D10660
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0x57FB9DAC

0xC2C4949F
"I don't know about that."
0x6E338E51

0xC2C4949F
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0xDCB6BB14
there to see you?"
0x55AE6916

0xC2C4949F
"Now and then?"
0x157F9AEA

0xC2C4949F
"Of an evening?"
0x26ECF156

0xC2C4949F
"Once or twice."
0xB14A51C8

0xC2C4949F
A pause.
0x05962448

0xC2C4949F
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x944A1D2A
was discovered?"
0x778070A8

0xC2C4949F
"Five months."
0xA2313A34

0xC2C4949F
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0xE9B58218

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0x912B1F47
window, and we by the table."
0x4EF9ABFD

0xC2C4949F
"Did he study much?"
0x6C478376

0xC2C4949F
"A good deal."
0xB86B36BE

0xC2C4949F
"What?"
0xF61FE132

0xC2C4949F
"Hindostanee."
0xFE53D7A6

0xC2C4949F
"And what did you do meantime?"
0xB39B9D94

0xC2C4949F
"I learnt German, at first."
0x9A73F5F2

0xC2C4949F
"Did he teach you?"
0xD6DD83F5

0xC2C4949F
"He did not understand German."
0x10394861

0xC2C4949F
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0x562F756C

0xC2C4949F
"A little Hindostanee."
0x37C2B74F

0xC2C4949F
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0x6209FBB9

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"And his sisters also?"
0x0E7C7FC9

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"Only you?"
0xCA1B02F1

0xC2C4949F
"Only me."
0xF48FB2EE

0xC2C4949F
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x715ABC23

0xC2C4949F
"No."
0x377AF9CB

0xC2C4949F
"He wished to teach you?"
0x3A725A50

0xC2C4949F
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0xC2C4949F
A second pause.
0xFA99ABC5

0xC2C4949F
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0xE5D84108

0xC2C4949F
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xF2CF875F

0xC2C4949F
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0x4E82F619

0xC2C4949F
"He asked me to marry him."
0xCD15A152

0xC2C4949F
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0x08367796

0xC2C4949F
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0xF0B9A127
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0x76A5CA46

0xC2C4949F
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0x6822B08B
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0x9D35F984
have given you notice to quit?"
0x0B4DE2AC

0xC2C4949F
"Because I am comfortable there."
0x7EE9362B

0xC2C4949F
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0xF9E1742E
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0x862E65C6
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xA3B724D0
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0xE23034BD
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x26885467
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0xEA684BA4
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0xB6F04C39

0xC2C4949F
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0x6123556D
accord."
0x1C609A3A

0xC2C4949F
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0xF0536E41
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0xD75C8D63
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0xA06126CA

0xC2C4949F
"Where must I go, sir?"
0x205D91E9

0xC2C4949F
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0x82C9AAB8

0xC2C4949F
"Who is that?"
0xF9D30A99

0xC2C4949F
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0x7B179426

0xC2C4949F
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0xD977A35F
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x4A0D55CB
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x1CBB60F0
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xC52B0C3D
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x887C66F0
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0xBEEBB71E
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x6B67485B
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0xFD01B9F5
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xECF2BBC6

0xC2C4949F
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0xFF836CCB
beloved master.  He smiled.
0xE2CC3207

0xC2C4949F
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0x39A53111
you and Rivers?"
0x57EE449C

0xC2C4949F
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0xAD59524C
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0xBF4A1995
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0xC6C79A45
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0x3A2E3F0B
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0x8520EE15
of me from your presence for ever."
0x1BDE08F7

0xC2C4949F
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0xDC6EC652

0xC2C4949F
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0xE275DD46

0xC2C4949F
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0xC901EAEA
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x9DA74198
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x3E46BB64
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0xD118AA30

0xC2C4949F
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0x876B858A
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0x8FD78565
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0x0DFCB4E4

0xC2C4949F
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0x73A948E2
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xA9634402
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x5673B14D
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x757B1DA1
offers them so safe a prop."
0xB944F5A2

0xC2C4949F
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x36324B8C

0xC2C4949F
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0xB28893A5

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0x68470DB8
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x26A38626
helped me.
0x97117220

0xC2C4949F
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0x0627BD0F

0xC2C4949F
"Do you, sir?"
0x338A1D37

0xC2C4949F
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0xEF6D3A3D

0xC2C4949F
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0x393F67BE

0xC2C4949F
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0xB4D06DB1

0xC2C4949F
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0x5C0B1281

0xC2C4949F
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0xDED29FD5

0xC2C4949F
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x9F1972EA

0xC2C4949F
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x8AA8E81B

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0x0128A60A

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0x3EF9D5C2
on?"
0x68374E9D

0xC2C4949F
"Yes, sir."
0xD0F413EA

0xC2C4949F
"Truly, Jane?"
0x83EC160C

0xC2C4949F
"Most truly, sir."
0x357CB1FD

0xC2C4949F
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0x42335001

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0xFEAE7E56
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0xE847649E
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0x5FD64CEE
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0xB4D091CB

0xC2C4949F
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x86666975

0xC2C4949F
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0x13C9EF41
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x1F01E817
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0xC6B697DC
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x3B87AB58

0xC2C4949F
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0x5B7C1653

0xC2C4949F
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0x9B083B6F
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x05435C0D
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0x73C1C99B

0xC2C4949F
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0x45C7CCD2
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0xF2FDC534
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0x8166A7E4
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x52E9F797
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0xC67576B2
her?"
0x8103FBF0

0xC2C4949F
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x839FF972

0xC2C4949F
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0x40DB2FAE
married instantly."
0xDCF3F20B

0xC2C4949F
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x5547C62E

0xC2C4949F
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0xADF09801
licence to get--then we marry."
0x4A07B17B

0xC2C4949F
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0x209CA6CF
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0x77049B26
your watch."
0x04BCC705

0xC2C4949F
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0xEE39E11B
use for it."
0x6D43D640

0xC2C4949F
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x62CBAC46
hungry?"
0x12B444AE

0xC2C4949F
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0xDC0973BB
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0xF7FAC6B1

0xC2C4949F
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x74A13472
is quite hot."
0xCF8992FC

0xC2C4949F
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0xB7FF2218
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0x122F93BD
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0x7B433BBB

0xC2C4949F
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0xC3A9329E

0xC2C4949F
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0x583F413A

0xC2C4949F
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x8B5612B7
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0xD1F459E0
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0x6BF6E559
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0x4318A506
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x1E2CC11E
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0x01639227
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xE7BB5479
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xAC574765
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0x4877DE88
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0xBE1F0854
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0xB1EBD1DB
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x5B07B6AD
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0xBEC99F92
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0xAF26DE8C
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0x04FF60B7

0xC2C4949F
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0xC944E90F
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x1AD6F9EF
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0x1488BE71
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0x2D9EDE3A
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x8FA6AAC1
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0xE5268020
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x371E5AAB
rejoining Jane.
0x8E8ECAFA

0xC2C4949F
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0xAD9B284F
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0xC404A440
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x6B2454A9
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0xFC8F386D
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0xC8163B44
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x8A1D40A5
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0x61C6988A
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0x01F9016E
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0x7CE13E6B
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x4D4D9E75

0xC2C4949F
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0x648D6A50

0xC2C4949F
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0x418979FA
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0x688E45AD

0xC2C4949F
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0x2242E7B6

0xC2C4949F
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x4963EB3F
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0xD79EAD5D
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0xFA59EFCA
that I heard what I now relate.
0x3B532B39

0xC2C4949F
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0xB8C9C259
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0x28A4A9C0
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x149E7F91
are you?'
0xAC5536BE

0xC2C4949F
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x55A79AC9
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xC95E08F8
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0x2A8C7DFF
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0xB0FC4FFB
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0xD9E385DA
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0xF0D5DA2F
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xA4CE3467
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x5FBD435C
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0xD91AE5A7
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0x95900638

0xC2C4949F
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xAE79FC5A
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0x7ECFB9E9
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0x88F1C072
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x6E0E9248
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xE88385F0
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xC5FFFFD7
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0xAF44D727
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x879ECC7A
them in my heart.
0xF2D497B3

0xC2C4949F
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xD1118B2B
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0xBB81FF05
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x6906EB5D
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0xC6824EA2
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0xD1FFD3C4
God!"
0xCB8839AF

0xC2C4949F
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0x119C7520
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x8B448916
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x0808276A

0xC2C4949F
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0xA5B72AEF
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0x8B5C4B45
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0x678BB93C

0xC2C4949F
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x6531C2F0
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x24083F1E
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x3BC2BB11
entered the wood, and wended homeward.

0xC2C4949F
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0xFC8B2B82

0xC2C4949F

0xC2C4949F
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0xDAF95914
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x71479A1A
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0xE9E45B53
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0xBEEF447C

0xC2C4949F
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0x2FED7F4D
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x3F82C446
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x606DAAE8
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x2617D4CF
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x52F577BC
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x905072C2
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x235A7950
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xAE469D95
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x047670A8
again over the roast, said only--
0x280C6CD9

0xC2C4949F
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0x25A09165

0xC2C4949F
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0xDC2508E5
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x19F4314C
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xB29A3F3E

0xC2C4949F
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x5C3E0FDF
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x940E01AC
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x1BA854E1
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x5E0407B1
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0xDA9F301F
politely pulled his forelock.
0x70764DE9

0xC2C4949F
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x4CE7284A
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0xAF226188
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xC907D807
caught the words--
0xAFC68613

0xC2C4949F
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x0C684306
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x0E90C970
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x339322BF

0xC2C4949F
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xD7C1E5F4
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0xF4BB8652
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x91A52DA5
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0x7FDD817E

0xC2C4949F
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0x4620A92C
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x15FF5F27
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x779D9086
grave or mine."
0x57F5901D

0xC2C4949F
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x1B3C063C
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x7C2A41E6
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0xE2050BF4
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0x2354AFC5
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0xD878B1D5
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x6A9DCBB6
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x551ABFE7

0xC2C4949F
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x8875960F
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0xF880666A
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xB5D4210B
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x3086A034
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x35AECD2A
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x326ADFAB
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x6C0BACA6
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x94B1B821
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0x4A9160C6
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0xF7D6F291
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x4C55AC99
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0xCC9F41B8
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xA99B4FC5
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x9734BC3E
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0xCB0B6710
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0xA67E6FDF
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0xBCC2BDA8
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0x3BD69683

0xC2C4949F
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x294A436D
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xEC949D77
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x44A6A827

0xC2C4949F
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0xE8E3C7E1
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0xB25E830A
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0xD7DAAB3F
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xADE9F840
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0xEDE69B23
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0xAD5E3BD9
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0x356AEE42
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0x7E2062FB
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x4A7D17D3
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x7A2FD703
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0xC9A30ABB
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x337C60B6
concord is the result.
0x98FCE56B

0xC2C4949F
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x6C73E9EE
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0xF770D6E5
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0xD2EE1E80
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0xAD7CE6D3
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x4145464C
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xEBB9D82D
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x2CF010D2
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0xC5918624
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0x16D694E0
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0xDC172F3A
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xF3198BE8
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0xAA94DB03
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x28D73CEB
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0xD95ADE40
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0x86C60631

0xC2C4949F
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0xC1A99E80
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0xA0ECBB07
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x9E0E5F17

0xC2C4949F
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x47AA0720

0xC2C4949F
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0x0C927F6F

0xC2C4949F
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0xE3695ACD

0xC2C4949F
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xB8B79BF2
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0x7E015A93
sure of it.
0x477E2987

0xC2C4949F
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x51BBFF7B
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x1578E98F
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x9E45D5D6
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0xBB985C20
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xC7721AFE
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xC676E3CE
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x5B40EA7C
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x8684DC80

0xC2C4949F
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0xEFA1BB6B
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0xF2AADB2D
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x431935C0
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x357E3AC6
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x0ACAE7A4
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x063320D5
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0xD286500F

0xC2C4949F
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x6190D73E
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x20318228
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x8324AA9D
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0xDF08051C
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0xBDCE90FB
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x6E0BD935
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0xE5CDB4E7
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0xE419EED9
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0xD7FDD7A4
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0xAF340786
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x92F69786
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x023CF3E1
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0xB572423F
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xC6FEA716
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x3928D4BA

0xC2C4949F
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x7954F411
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x01FF74EC
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0xC4C932ED
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x1CC54DF0
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xB726E0A1
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0xAB70592D
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x98A9C05F
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0xB941FECB
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x15A5500C
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0xE5F95F0C

0xC2C4949F
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x95FB28CD
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0x5B555626
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x4D228810
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x4BD068AA
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x840EE722
people in all walks of life.
0x2B25D90C

0xC2C4949F
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0x378945EE
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0x23ED2AF1
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0xBF0FF325
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0xCD9B97AC
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0x795CD6CB
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

0xC2C4949F
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0x29FD5A54
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0xF8A5FAF4
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0x5DEAEACD
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0x1CE9A30B
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0x5DD8E6D2
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

0x3D3CBF0D
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0x8CA533AC
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
