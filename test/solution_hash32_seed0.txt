PREFACE
0x4D81649C

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x78CC7258
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0xF50E550F
miscellaneous remark.
0x80048923

0x924EE0AB
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0xEA78502C

0x924EE0AB
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x896AACCD
few pretensions.
0x76A3FD33

0x924EE0AB
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x487A47A1
obscure aspirant.
0x9D93450D

0x924EE0AB
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x108E5BF6
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x0723390E
Author.
0x5D435579

0x924EE0AB
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x29735F63
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0xFC73BFCC
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xC4CA0895
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x052E2B53
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x8E51CBE5
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0x1FB7FB5A

0x924EE0AB
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x765249C0
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0xA5C121A1
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x59577B36
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0xDA74B7B9
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x1D302E3F
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0xCDE86265
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0xA3D42FA7
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0xBD71F3A1

0x924EE0AB
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0xDF0D1E17
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x461D65A0
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0xC0B43FA3
Thorns.
0x25439A03

0x924EE0AB
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xABEE1039
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x70C61DDB
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x5D9156B3
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xB6AF56AC
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xFF75555C
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xCCB607AB
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x0662213D

0x924EE0AB
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0xE9B42429
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x495ACBEE
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xD0E2E94B
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x8004BD7A
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0xD17CE78C
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0xCCEFEC01

0x924EE0AB
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0xBC5AEE96
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0xCF229C86
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0x6976A11C
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x200611EF

0x924EE0AB
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x86F4DB4F
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x6F479656
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0xD1F74E09
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0xC35399F5
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x9A47719A
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0xD759525B
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x5093FD66
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x985757AB
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x84D3622B
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xDFBA5DD3

0x924EE0AB
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x7E898E78
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0xC62462EC
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0x07A75693
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xF42CCE16
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x52EBD266
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0xE12AE724
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0x2F479F40
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0xCD062C3B
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x1DDCE2F8
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x7D02F56A
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0x06351A74
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0x18B86406
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x980BFCFD
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0x5E96AE63
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0x65649A25

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0xEF49AEF7
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0xE0A20A56
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x833F1CF0
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xF6B8D8F7
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0x8B2EF86E
denied where it is justly due.
0x716F5943

0x924EE0AB
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0xDE8223AF
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0x2525D36B

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x732EE3A9
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x7E2C834B
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x71E9F680
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0xB05D79C2
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xE2F51E27

0x924EE0AB
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xDCCC4DDA
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x9D41FCF9
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xA9EC4771
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x8041C208
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0xEEC8EC0B

0x924EE0AB
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0xAC5686AE
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xF86C668C
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x57C0D5FF
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x061B409F
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x56B9CE04
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xF13847B2
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0xBBE923F5
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x21CB89E5
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0xFCCAF2FC
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x95517F50
little children."
0x94B61F94

0x924EE0AB
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x694ECFE3

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x8CC1A3FB
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0xD0A5015F
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0xCCE787C4

0x924EE0AB
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x5FE7097A
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xB66B15A5
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x7F5795BC
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0xFB13F54F
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xAEA99E80
retirement.
0x56584F2D

0x924EE0AB
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x278F212F
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0xF7A86A49
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0x48BBCCC0
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xF93E9EC7
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0xFB9847F3
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x02F32E71
lamentable blast.
0x5D381C1D

0x924EE0AB
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x44766CD8
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x0587CB55
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x95663E0A
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0xFC5A4B03
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x17D3C065
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x55889CCD
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0x05A39C62

0x924EE0AB
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x298F8432
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0xD012BE26
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xBE45D961
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x7597FB8C

0x924EE0AB
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0x63CBB944
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0xB476F106
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x9A3DDE66
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x34152F0E
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x31B78A30
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0xF445BF76
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0xD8884959
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0xA4BAE028
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0x4B1858B1
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0xCFFE798C
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x3163A592
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0xE098F503
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x1F6500C8

0x924EE0AB
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0xEE3704C5
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x745027D2
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x0056A7EC
hour of eventide.
0x84FE1653

0x924EE0AB
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0x7DD37B33

0x924EE0AB
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0xE2BC0E89
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0xF4EED873

0x924EE0AB
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x088CB6F1
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x10112F52

0x924EE0AB
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x07CE21B6
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0xFE07BF14
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x1DCD7FF1
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x99EC6541
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x615181ED
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x8FCA6595
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0x9B3FDD76
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x0EE5BE9E
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x0F0D184A

0x924EE0AB
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x8AF25607
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x7EC889C1
room door opened.
0x09FB7E91

0x924EE0AB
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0xFC73AD38
found the room apparently empty.
0x56ABD86C

0x924EE0AB
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x19A9A06C
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0xC00AA30A
animal!"
0x5732362E

0x924EE0AB
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0xBF90B914
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x001D7ECD
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0xCEBC9164
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x44D27205

0x924EE0AB
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x0EEF8010

0x924EE0AB
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x19A9D830
forth by the said Jack.
0x52E73F67

0x924EE0AB
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x2A961B8E

0x924EE0AB
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0x9537C0EE
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0xE825B51C
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0x8306C203

0x924EE0AB
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0xD92895B7
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0xA77E0EDC
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0xC427E409
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x2EF7288B
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x8A709002
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x01B843CC
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x673E2350
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0xC31C9C69
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x88FE7D5A
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0x5F6AC1E1
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x91875608
home.
0xDB1F6E70

0x924EE0AB
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0xBDE8347E
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0xC1FCC1C2
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0x36B66B7C
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x187708E0
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x62A005D9
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xAC920328
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xCB647057
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x78BFF9EF
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x4308EDD1
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0xCCF20D45
her back.
0x14C616CC

0x924EE0AB
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x739FF0C8
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0x436127D0
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x08726F9B
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0xF86C79AA
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x5D7BA5D8
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x8732C616
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x416260C1
chair.
0x901649AF

0x924EE0AB
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x8ED98003
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x930FE12D
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x6C7CEFA8

0x924EE0AB
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x63A7D2E3
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0xD3D32C94
insult.
0x8C118A73

0x924EE0AB
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0xAC98BDFE

0x924EE0AB
"I was reading."
0x8C556EA3

0x924EE0AB
"Show the book."
0xB3AA90B7

0x924EE0AB
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0xC88BE36B

0x924EE0AB
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0xC6DBFEEC
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0x9D83E0CE
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0xEC02FF1F
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0xD88E6CE5
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xC17E0318
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0x68A926B3
the mirror and the windows."
0xBE3334FC

0x924EE0AB
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xECA998B3
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0xCB58709B
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x1AE204AD
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x5DDAC24B
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0x66DDF616
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0xF694999A

0x924EE0AB
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x28C722F6
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x59B4F2D4

0x924EE0AB
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x52108455
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x8519F865
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0xF8EC99E5

0x924EE0AB
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x8AAC4EFC
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0x4AD83BFD

0x924EE0AB
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0xF94BF7A4
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0xC02C5B99
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0xBB0F3AA2
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x94F6B56B
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x622EF346
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0xC2DC25B4
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0xD5FBBECF
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xB7C2EBE2
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x1D619217

0x924EE0AB
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0x61DCD988

0x924EE0AB
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x956AFDC3

0x924EE0AB
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x09EC97E5

0x924EE0AB
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x93C32A64
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x14F645ED

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER II
0xA7794244

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xE4227247
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x0959102C
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0xB076133E
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x78A6523D
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x4C5B552F
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0xB21222A3

0x924EE0AB
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0xD1D9E676

0x924EE0AB
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x85D59F95
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x5DDEFB8B
young master."
0xA9E7FEAB

0x924EE0AB
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x887EBF08

0x924EE0AB
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x87B1DD6C
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0xB3D9E7B3

0x924EE0AB
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x8577B957
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xEB9275ED
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x474958AA

0x924EE0AB
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x8108A9A2
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x4ECBF894

0x924EE0AB
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x78BCD1D4
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x73FDACA9
little of the excitement out of me.
0x2F3F14A0

0x924EE0AB
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x6EC7FA4C

0x924EE0AB
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0xB524EE01

0x924EE0AB
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0xAFEEA2C0
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0xF53A451D
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xF3C68199
incredulous of my sanity.
0x0BDBEADC

0x924EE0AB
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0xDBDA1EDA

0x924EE0AB
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x936BFA9C
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x465A45BF
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0x1C587E9A

0x924EE0AB
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0xF94237F0
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xA8729896
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x58041CA3

0x924EE0AB
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0x9E0470AC
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xC4AE5F8D
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0x0D74C208
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0xF5F6EF2E

0x924EE0AB
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0xD988A734
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0xDC2EE0CE
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x3F92EC6A
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x4A506160
them."
0x2E3A7A3E

0x924EE0AB
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0xB7A02836
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0xE0075E3D
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x487198EC
away, I am sure."
0x8E66C1E6

0x924EE0AB
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0xE95723E7
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0x7A67127B
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0xC810A388
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0x00CBAD94
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x7A628210
fetch you away."
0x56EA59B6

0x924EE0AB
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0x7ED6033B

0x924EE0AB
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0xF0EA2B4B
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0x2A0E723A
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x3A347B71
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0xB83E09AE
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xAF814413
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0xC9C6BA49
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0xBB027F9A
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x129CC837
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xCF6518E8
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x90175B66
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0x6E094DB4
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0xCC54F3CA
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x8C191F3F
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x6393B7C6
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0xBC32F2BF
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x24D095FA

0x924EE0AB
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0xA8D4FBEB
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x0BD0E430
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0x6B151235
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0xAF7F8B48
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x0535A2AB
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x534BA1D2
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x2A23989E
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x04BA98BD
in spite of its grandeur.
0x7BB6FA7F

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0xC8C8EDBF
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x0DA75505
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x4A2AAE45
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0x348A9A44

0x924EE0AB
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x0FBB0E78
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0x05A7510E
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xD8FBD99E
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x5BE2C0F4
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0x74F8C5F1
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xD9E80A35
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0xC304092F
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x9ABB528D
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xF2B21B9D
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x59BE26FB
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xBF1A60F1
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x1A3E7758
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x5BA38825
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0xA3C5A312
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0xD44861AB
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x95014277

0x924EE0AB
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0xF92F5462
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0xCA869CD7
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0xE92AA121
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x36F1F447

0x924EE0AB
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0x3AE35137
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x76E55A12
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x8A3D2AC8
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0xD3DBAF58
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x3BCFCD07
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0x231B02C9
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x7417ADC8
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0xC85D9653
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0xB9BD70BB
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0xD84CAB45
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x4BF64A65
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0x129B3C89
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0xE4ED86A9
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0x69328227
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0xE51942DB
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x97221F03
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0xBF2D75AC
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0xB6795103
night.
0x178557A6

0x924EE0AB
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0xC9CF1D3D
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x6498F644
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x69EDEFF7
general opprobrium.
0x58CB41E7

0x924EE0AB
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x56E7E5F6
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x46E4A59A
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0xAD452832
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x77544615
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0x97AC31E9

0x924EE0AB
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x0F2748DE
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0x0B072875
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x76202C03
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0xFAB74DFC
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xBB81A83D

0x924EE0AB
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0x4680DA86
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xDFBA7A30
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xD0D402F9
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0xCF7F774B
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0xAAD469AD
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x0BF86852
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x4630D4C1
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x1AAAF20A
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0xA71D9E8D
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x11D7AB2B
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x98C54C1C
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x7316ECEF
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0x2892713B

0x924EE0AB
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x78EC356C
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0xAF346A93
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x3D5A0B25
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x64D82EBC
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x0CC5C53F
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x9B982250
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0xFC8A1DF5
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0xA5A927F1
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x3D861934
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0xB7B38D63
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0xFDC0EE2E
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0x950F75BC
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x895BF3F4
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x74E1CE74
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x7C09660A
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0xF195480D
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0x99B2B458
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0xEE16D2A4
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x87E235C3
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0x8672059D
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x2B7821F6
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x68992AA2

0x924EE0AB
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x2964A874
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0xACEB2B0E
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0xBD7D6D7B
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x4686FDC0
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x6C98107F
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x2240BCF0
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x641C914B
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x070AE48F
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x1FF79D08
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xB52267E5
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0x7797A7D9
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x6FCBE084
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0xDAF14EF2
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x04A9E23A
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x41FE7594
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x6A064358
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0x8243005E
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x3923DC8F
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0xBF1A8804
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x4E5DC76B
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x06C5F015
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0xE5CB5C00
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x683A0A0E
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0x32FED01A
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x3F9C2141
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0xF3ED68E6
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x0A80C2B6
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x18F95FB3
Abbot entered.
0x234AD09C

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x141E7A6A

0x924EE0AB
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0x5E1B5E45

0x924EE0AB
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xDB37B8B1

0x924EE0AB
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xF2B85963
Bessie.
0x32B37E0A

0x924EE0AB
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0xA8B49F7E
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x876D29C9

0x924EE0AB
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0xF49F25E7
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x7225ECD0
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0xEF308834

0x924EE0AB
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0x7AC723E0
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0xC1E7F35A
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x1297E21F
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0x2149DEF1

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0x5837149C

0x924EE0AB
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x8DDBF49A
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0xE876A840
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x9C71F5A7
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x53484C88
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x31AFC14A
then."
0xC19AA632

0x924EE0AB
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0x5225F3D8
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x8C2684DF

0x924EE0AB
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0xF99DB30A
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0x483EAE42
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0xD010630E
duplicity.
0x1D38457C

0x924EE0AB
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0xC5937CB3
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0xE4DA8AC0
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x1AC583DA
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0x3ADDC329

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xE66A6782
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x7AA6A5DD
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x9F28B982
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x81CAC40B
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x06FCFDF3
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0xA9C632F3
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x7140897B
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0x8B3BC58B
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0x31A99935

0x924EE0AB
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x7056FB43
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0xDE668EC1
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0xC582F38A
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0xDACDB822
pillow, leaning over me.
0xFC88DB85

0x924EE0AB
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xFDCD3541
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x96E6DFB3
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x888C4F77
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x2C751FD2
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x50D17049
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0xFEDDDA19
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x8C7A740D
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x36F85D03

0x924EE0AB
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xF3FDA074

0x924EE0AB
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0xB8C8485D
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0xA2D2FB2A
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0x008509CE
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x1D3A1268
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x57249D84
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0xF49B6AAD
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0x104F93AA
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0xE9673E9C

0x924EE0AB
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x987470DA

0x924EE0AB
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x1B2A3113
rough.  "I will try."
0x7B422716

0x924EE0AB
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x9037C3B2

0x924EE0AB
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xC30CD3DD

0x924EE0AB
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x8082DB75
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x36AC83D0

0x924EE0AB
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0xCC8D2C6E

0x924EE0AB
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0xE3837201

0x924EE0AB
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x9E42AF55
soon, no doubt."
0x27EF5C25

0x924EE0AB
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0xB3B420CA
say--
0x769960C5

0x924EE0AB
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0x23ECED3E
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x546911C6
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x9CF157FF
rather too hard."
0x002CFBD0

0x924EE0AB
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0xB043460A
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x2FE3A223
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0xD2D6ED20
the main subject discussed.
0x14525E04

0x924EE0AB
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x736D6A23
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0xB49182A5
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x85C239B8

0x924EE0AB
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0x6156433D
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0xCF12D236
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0x3BCAAC99

0x924EE0AB
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xE8BE7FB1
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0xCFA5EAB4
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0x32E5D906
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x2F640884
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x7859CF21
bad propensities.
0x9F05FCA0

0x924EE0AB
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x7A224288
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x57B03AA7
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0x791B2C15
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0xCE90B80F
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0xF9E7F476
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0xC66B6F06
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x1FC2259D
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xEAAD691E
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x3048AA1F
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xD512AA40
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0x18E889A5
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x357BCB61
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xC93077D1

0x924EE0AB
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0x75DAA599
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0xCFEFFECA
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0xCD7EC282
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x6A1422D6
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0xD985D2F4
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x9667D223
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0xB8EA5AF1
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x9B6E6E44
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xCCB338B5
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xC2018A71
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0xDF939707
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x5DD6DA30
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0xEB79D401
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x2C592CC4
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0xA972FB6A
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0xCA142FEF
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0xA514ACA3
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x1C4C741B
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x0478D6C3
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x659491C3
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x20E71C9F
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xCE4ADF2C
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0xC87B6BC0
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x32A95CA9
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x7BF3A068
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x4CB4A8FF
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xC8AF4346
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0xF7779214
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0xFB400BB5
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x26E05BC3
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0x1D1DBA0E
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x227CEDFC
untasted tart.
0x942194D6

0x924EE0AB
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x6CF561AD
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xB43EB3A2
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0xC58F95FA
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x71D21CFF

0x924EE0AB
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x9C9F9F84
      A long time ago."
0x4661B498

0x924EE0AB
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0xFBD4C727
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0xDFA815B0
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x3404460C
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x9F614E11
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0x25943F23
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0xEAFC705B
one.
0xABA8A893

0x924EE0AB
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x3F6116B1
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x4948F1B9
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x24FA7BB6
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0x1CAF2FAA

0x924EE0AB
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0x97444ED8
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0xD3E74CD1
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x6799C43F
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x06723081

0x924EE0AB
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0xDD8C816B
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0x86C43330
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xBCD9D1A8
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0xBFBC83D8

0x924EE0AB
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x5AF98832
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x3528ABAC
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0xD4E510AE
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0xB6AE4384

0x924EE0AB
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x9A219EFB
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x33E6EAFA
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0x5C4D5F6B
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0xC3751D90

0x924EE0AB
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x8414F24D
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0xB0923B7B
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x032C6D0E
Lloyd came again.
0x6FC61049

0x924EE0AB
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0xF54D06AA
how is she?"
0x25CAE0B2

0x924EE0AB
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0xA09C0A9B

0x924EE0AB
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x074ACED7
is Jane, is it not?"
0xD7DD2D9F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0xA64DCF68

0x924EE0AB
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0xF297E664
Have you any pain?"
0xC9112817

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir."
0x93403769

0x924EE0AB
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x65C641B9
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0xC5AE9D60

0x924EE0AB
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x433F344F

0x924EE0AB
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x31F487AA
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x53349FED
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xD062DDB9

0x924EE0AB
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0xAD677E55

0x924EE0AB
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x252C759C
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0xDA4DD6E2
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x6CE44FDD
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xA935647E
leisure, he said--
0x5AD709BF

0x924EE0AB
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0xE5B0A6CB

0x924EE0AB
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0xF9ADFDDA

0x924EE0AB
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x22BC6FAD
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0xA15BA238

0x924EE0AB
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0x2195C205
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x4FC97865
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xD239E73A

0x924EE0AB
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x2051861D
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0xC6EFB863
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x0DA16185

0x924EE0AB
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0xC98B9C56
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0xF2B5BB54

0x924EE0AB
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x4822773D
Bessie was gone.
0x350931C9

0x924EE0AB
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0x1D9DCF0C

0x924EE0AB
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0xD10E0E8F

0x924EE0AB
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0x9B5963B5

0x924EE0AB
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x60D6D7EC
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x81007E6D
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x2DE07794
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x31D05D6B

0x924EE0AB
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0xF3A1C8A6
daylight?"
0xC5249E33

0x924EE0AB
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0xC124E9AD
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0xE5CFB109

0x924EE0AB
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0x7035A243

0x924EE0AB
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0x9AB76ACB
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0xA9CF25D3
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0x5DFDE994
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0xD6BA52DE
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x260AE31F
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0x1BFAA88B
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x37B4FAB0

0x924EE0AB
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0xDE172A10

0x924EE0AB
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x18E64A54

0x924EE0AB
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x8DEF5599

0x924EE0AB
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0xEC795146

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xD40FE9C3

0x924EE0AB
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xF760C19A
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0xF4B32C58

0x924EE0AB
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x13E1E467
than a servant."
0x6DD6D6F6

0x924EE0AB
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0xE4B41580

0x924EE0AB
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x5736C309
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0x7FD61A33

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x87BCB69D

0x924EE0AB
"I think not, sir."
0x7F9C9759

0x924EE0AB
"None belonging to your father?"
0x7FBA83F4

0x924EE0AB
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xE05FBC41
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0xEA1447BC
them."
0x2E3A7A3E

0x924EE0AB
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x9ADBF493

0x924EE0AB
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0xCFDBDFC7
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xF92A643E
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0x574B93D4
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x8E0B99ED
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x98881DD2

0x924EE0AB
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x4B4F8156

0x924EE0AB
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x97DE707D

0x924EE0AB
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x56B6F2AA
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0xAB4EC787
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x9597A285
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x90D429D2
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0x14196B30
the price of caste.
0xCA57BC4F

0x924EE0AB
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0xD7562F31

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0xB43806CA
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x7CBA97D6

0x924EE0AB
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x88D2B17B

0x924EE0AB
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x2BB7588B
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0x6D30E594
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0xF50B07F9
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0xDD702422
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x6B81B031
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xD46010FA
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xE7FD021B
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0x848A198C
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0x142ED815
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0xB377BEFD
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x99F76BD2
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0x85A08579
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x4C143DED
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0xB3D47F98

0x924EE0AB
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x301C2E68
musings.
0xCFE7EB75

0x924EE0AB
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0x29F3A4BE
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0xDC754C41
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0xF99D1F19

0x924EE0AB
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0xEAA11013
the gravel-walk.
0x8D44C932

0x924EE0AB
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0x66851042
to her before I go."
0xEE5A32CC

0x924EE0AB
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x8B2EEF47
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0x9771E867
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0xB69B8AD5
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xF7779E32
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0x309D4F4C
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0xFEDB4EC1
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0xAE1DA237
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0xCE5CA784
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x4775DCE6
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0xE72FA58C

0x924EE0AB
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0xB8BC5E9E
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xDA59EE8F
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x96D59A7F
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x1EDD92EC
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x58FDAF1A
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x56E685CE
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x1FBC31D5
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x4F13410A
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0xE2203764
of each other.
0xD1E68457

0x924EE0AB
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x6BE5F603
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0xB3DE46B4

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0xF37A5BF6
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x73145833
little toad as that."
0xF198EBD8

0x924EE0AB
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0x02466A48
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0xE78EA394

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0xA64BED48
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0xF7C99D65
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0xD59E2E10
rabbit for supper."
0x11919D7A

0x924EE0AB
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.

CHAPTER IV
0x40295EAC

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0x915F113F
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x361E96F7
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0x5AAF4809
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x3C7ABBBB
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x5D1BBE81
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0x9295B05D
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x9B502F35
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0xA48AFC33
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0xD3749072
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x79D74558
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x9DB300AA
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x79CE51A8
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x3390CD61
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x302731D2
and rooted aversion.
0xD508FCC1

0x924EE0AB
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0x2D47688F
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xB282DB3B
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0xD8DA53B9
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x1EC1D657
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0xD155B8F1
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x16A36637
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xFC9132B6
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x12628113
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0x8BF4DD69
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x9AFF2079
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xD61BFFE8
was stopped rather harshly--
0x3D5A2722

0x924EE0AB
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x87017D78
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0xDFE74335
should associate with her."
0xAB8E4F2A

0x924EE0AB
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x1DCC9E81
deliberating on my words--
0x9DE4EF6F

0x924EE0AB
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x1F833BB0

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0xFD133E7A
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x59567917
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x3D6487B1
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0xB717C262
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0xDAC5B4D4

0x924EE0AB
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0xA3B32345
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x87F7882C
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0xA2004231
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0xDE142E57

0x924EE0AB
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xF3E5CE12
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x27929815
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0x08DFC07F
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0xC92F703B

0x924EE0AB
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x2487C886
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0x44AAF96B
wish me dead."
0x85A5F348

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0xBB908C2F
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xA4ADCEBA
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x05D838F8
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0xA43C1EDA
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x1D1F76D3
in my breast.
0x175A9B68

0x924EE0AB
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x4C51DA54
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x0005F4F9
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0xF6E5D3FA
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0x4BCEB79B
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xAEBA9B26
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xD44DAE20
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x48E35697
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x453AFA71
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0xB6E690F7
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0x865D7583
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x01C9CD4E
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x26C67B72
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0x07A18BB0
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x53B65A7B
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x510215B0
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0x11A63345
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0xF0F59758
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0xEC8E7D0D
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x2BA96388
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0xC1649B4D
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0x1A6AB34C
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0xBB30871B
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x28C5C208
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0xA09DF1E7
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x399A9A97
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x3EC6C72E
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x4BB1733C
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0x1BB274E6
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x3C07FFB1
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x43FEA7EB
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xBFA41D4A
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x73F78426
to be happy likewise.
0x6E216C97

0x924EE0AB
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x2C7FB2F1
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0xF05D40C0
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x1154E810
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x08A8BEAE
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x34A7F76D
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x0FEAE09F
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0xF1550499
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0xADDE024A
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x0D82E21A
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0x7E457801
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0xE51CBA54
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xEF0D53A1
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x9FAD4AD7
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xFFD85FFC
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0xDE2EAB3C
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x5EC0DC2E
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x3A8EC634
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x010ED53B
Gateshead Hall.
0x72EE9862

0x924EE0AB
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xD654FD1B
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0x78A816BD
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0xEEDF9DF8
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x78F7EB2D
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x17145D47
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x6357FF55
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x118F4B62
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x5511DA1B
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xBF768CDC
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x3322B15E
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x3BC436BD
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x26A885AB
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xF3727099
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x337E52B3
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xE58912A5
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0x82FF5BCA
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x2714DE45
accuracy.
0x5B894148

0x924EE0AB
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x5D4A93A9
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x2BE74DC8
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x880EA5DB
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x57D6BAD1
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x5C1133EB
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0xAD365B87
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x5DBE7C0C
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xEAECEFE2
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x2D58AD48
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x8ABC710D
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x28D98A33
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x1EB149C4
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0xDF393643
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0x73DD1949
frost.
0xBE4D6C59

0x924EE0AB
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0xFC860871
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x6AA976E3
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0x3B9C792C
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0x5E3988DF
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0x49C316AA
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x1C0E0320
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0x47F69DA6
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0xF178D6FE
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x0C1FF810
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0xAD9E5299
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x35F9469D
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0xDB6C27BC
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xA9120C4D
nursery.
0x1D56194E

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0xBD971EB0
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0xF4600278
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x3AB94AA3
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0xDBEAAA4B
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0xF9DEA9B2

0x924EE0AB
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x230FBA2E

0x924EE0AB
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x40FA6C5B
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x9B2EC816
window for?"
0x16B9B235

0x924EE0AB
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x7EC85EEC
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0x4C6C8B5A
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x732DBE45
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x88D62D50
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x346C2A9E
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0x33C941F0

0x924EE0AB
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x5C1F4052
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0xFEBA81C4
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x22C86635
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x70B646BA
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x5938086D
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x367C4D2F

0x924EE0AB
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0x8611C363
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0xABEB380E
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0xBF21B29B
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x1E8076F7
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0xF67E75CD
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x50CB42E2

0x924EE0AB
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x272B94B0
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x7ED834AC
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x301A4070
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0xBE77F846
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x77AC5C2A
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x652B641E
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x2277459B
by way of capital.
0x532413DD

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x7952512D
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x4C223693
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x23BAC0F7
you."
0x8D4EE5F3

0x924EE0AB
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x2010BDA9
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x55F6CAF8
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x48FB1609
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x05976F20

0x924EE0AB
"Ten years."
0x423A0DC0

0x924EE0AB
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x350DD7EF
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x15CEECD6

0x924EE0AB
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x74969E71

0x924EE0AB
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x9FEEE5E2
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0xC2E00985
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0xB94EFB80

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x9D16E7E5

0x924EE0AB
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x35FA0460
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x2E5F8E79
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x0C9F8357
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x168FCB31

0x924EE0AB
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0xCB7F3438
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0xE6B74CD3
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x0C720796

0x924EE0AB
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x36AA809D
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x5F28B888
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x61893933

0x924EE0AB
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0xBE68A3E5
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x2324A047

0x924EE0AB
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0xD9BD637A

0x924EE0AB
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0xB8DE7550

0x924EE0AB
"A pit full of fire."
0xCF8CDD53

0x924EE0AB
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x6AF4A59E
ever?"
0xF11394E9

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir."
0x93403769

0x924EE0AB
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x0BD3B951

0x924EE0AB
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x4E4FCC99
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0x85B684D3

0x924EE0AB
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0x47CBD0C6
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x54A65D1B
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x531A1838
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x5A040CA1

0x924EE0AB
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x5266B2CD
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0x8D771097
enough away.
0xB5244101

0x924EE0AB
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x17B940A9
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0xD729001F

0x924EE0AB
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x48F72B33
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x5D266135

0x924EE0AB
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0xF08BD901

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x13D3D3B1

0x924EE0AB
"Sometimes."
0x6412764B

0x924EE0AB
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0xC64324A5

0x924EE0AB
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xB9A5977F
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xF4A9BBF0
and Jonah."
0x6B223FE5

0x924EE0AB
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x30AB56DA

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir."
0x93403769

0x924EE0AB
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0xDFBEB901
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x8EB16147
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x5EA50AA0
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0xD6833F92
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x0B6743FC
piety."
0x4BD17533

0x924EE0AB
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0xC90327EE

0x924EE0AB
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0xEC14CEEC
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x8505F268
give you a heart of flesh."
0xEFF1125C

0x924EE0AB
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0xAA1640CB
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x46C8AC98
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0xC357FF48
conversation herself.
0x930ED331

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x2FC9B904
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0xAF0D871C
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x889C18B6
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xC60E7A12
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x186207A8
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0x7BF835DF
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x37240061

0x924EE0AB
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x43B952F4
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x061AE590
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0x39B7B6A0
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xD41931A7
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0x78F196E7
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x712B4C8D
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0xDA7F1CA1
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x74986A0E
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0xACB5895A
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xAA10711B

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x6EE7C463
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x54288D37

0x924EE0AB
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0xA80777A1
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0xEC8F4D4B
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0xA2DC2134
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x33F4CC85

0x924EE0AB
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xF29199BD
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x6C1B57D9
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x16FFE6CF
Lowood."
0x38A73B66

0x924EE0AB
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x81BA5D5E
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0xFDDCA121
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x2E27B897
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x6A62EAA3
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0x810E9036
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0x64D6DD7F
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x70FC58A5
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x7942F25A
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0xCE77AD48
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x767C65E5
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0xE86859FF
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x93D03331

0x924EE0AB
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x29CFAB41
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xA6F4EE19
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0xD78F9A8E
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x64AB460D

0x924EE0AB
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0x5DF2C443
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xF6BEBEAA
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x88DDCACB
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0x39EBDE9C
inhabitants."
0x46FDA85E

0x924EE0AB
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x52664246
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0x1403E4AB
and prospects?"
0x5406D346

0x924EE0AB
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0xB3830B1F
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0xAEEDECDE
of her election."
0x0C8BE871

0x924EE0AB
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x138E3674
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x818E4118
becoming too irksome."
0x6E74A3AA

0x924EE0AB
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0xD8AF5A15
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0x30482B6E
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0xF9986EE8
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x65748344
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x3F0C1A24

0x924EE0AB
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x3C5AD409
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0xCDC92326

0x924EE0AB
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0x32FEAAB7
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0xB0DD1597
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x1B1CC553
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x400B6C2C

0x924EE0AB
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0xEA1FB304
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xBA09D700

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x0BEC9A51
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x1D7FEEF3
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0xAFDB50EA
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0x01605AE1
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x4B61BCE3
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0xF9E58B48
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0xA7FFC1BC
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x34BDA4BF
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0x8179407F
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x462F59D7
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x5BDFD633
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x2B11C680
handsome attire.
0xF134F9DE

0x924EE0AB
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xF707ABB9
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x5702A069
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0xD15262C9
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0xB1FE1128
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x93DFFA6F
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x3E4FC5EB
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0xD4236CC2
fomented now within me.
0x02AAB7D2

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x8032B2DC
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x588D989F

0x924EE0AB
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0xEC5EE3AF
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0xC1E24CFF
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0xA20503EF
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xC9798053
to her.
0xC315DE55

0x924EE0AB
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0xFAFB9AE1
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0xEAECC671
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x765E2257

0x924EE0AB
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x7BB1F55D
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x611CFB01
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x50BC41D7
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0xAADE384E

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0xD9116504
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0x75EECA5D

0x924EE0AB
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0x9545B80A
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0xD7A728A3
used to a child.
0xA2D243B1

0x924EE0AB
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0xA389D12F
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x1736A48A

0x924EE0AB
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x61802A1F
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x4EDC6C59
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0xAF09B20A
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x2D66DAFD
miserable cruelty."
0x6DE80BFB

0x924EE0AB
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x6B51F57A

0x924EE0AB
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x20518CF4
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0xC56B012D
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x30D70277
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0x3E174736
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x7C8C7825
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x04009F4A
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0x583F9546
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0xDB53FD2C
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x41DB90B0
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x3043D6A3

0x924EE0AB
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0x44D5662D

0x924EE0AB
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xDA62E6F8
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0xBCD3C186
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x54836762
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x908E49B1
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0xD2AE783D
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0xEF5A14DB
would cry.
0x233BF536

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0xA08957F7
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0xCA12C767

0x924EE0AB
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x5BBD19A5

0x924EE0AB
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x7EADCC04
your friend."
0x003C618F

0x924EE0AB
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0x9C4E8E2A
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xAEBCEC19
you have done."
0x25626364

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0xFE0FA36E
their faults."
0xB35DB19C

0x924EE0AB
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0xCC0430C0

0x924EE0AB
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0xCACABEAD
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0x169DA78E

0x924EE0AB
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x7321839A
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0x5D94B41A

0x924EE0AB
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0xBC70FDD0
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x639DFE9F

0x924EE0AB
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0xF86C8EC7
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0xEB8BAA90
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x1DEA9190
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0xAA74D6FD
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x319236B0
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xEE5ECFC2
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0xEB47E1D1
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0x391C63E3
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0x0FD1829E
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x76A6AF3B
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x97250786
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0xF8D15375
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0xB4ADE759
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x0031A5CA

0x924EE0AB
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x39332417
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xD7E5CC69
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0xDF0D4716
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0xE8D25A72
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x4369378C
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x941A31D9
of my nature.
0x3350EFD8

0x924EE0AB
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0xBC88A716
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x1FA2AC84
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x07B3D6EC
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x8783CFB8
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x1BF1519A
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xFDBB1BBC
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0x82CCB77B
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0x009AEC52
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x9283EFF3
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x7EDEF022
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0xCBCAFC31
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xEB1AE4CD
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x8E64A493
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x4DDC8962
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0xBFA76173
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0xFD66F05E
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x92E1BE54
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0xE4C0DF4C

0x924EE0AB
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0x9CC52306
to lunch!"
0xACEFCA7F

0x924EE0AB
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xBFEC666B
came tripping down the path.
0x5DCB1DFA

0x924EE0AB
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x763999C5
called?"
0x488BC202

0x924EE0AB
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x4A7A18F4
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x96457421
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0xE9DE5E74
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x97DB76E6
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x28AD5567
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0xF11D0DA6

0x924EE0AB
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0xA5023C58
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xEF157714

0x924EE0AB
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0x8ED26346
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x799C23D8
suppose?"
0xBF5EF786

0x924EE0AB
I nodded.
0x3CB7ACC0

0x924EE0AB
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x8B3FF517

0x924EE0AB
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0xA4540449

0x924EE0AB
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0x1E38E962
be bolder."
0x47CCD3C0

0x924EE0AB
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x5BCAD3AA

0x924EE0AB
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x9359757B
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x1C9A5203
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x0FE02451
for you."
0x5569A381

0x924EE0AB
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0xD26AE674

0x924EE0AB
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x908FD022
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x85D95F82
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xA2FD14D4
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xBB972E4C
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0xABD83110
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x25803E67

0x924EE0AB
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x1639D733

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x7854DCD9
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x3F8A4BE7
provoking."
0x1F95299E

0x924EE0AB
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0xE502F02A
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x31CB3EF9
dread."
0x846BF69B

0x924EE0AB
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0xD13F56CC

0x924EE0AB
"As you do, Bessie?"
0xDF5F36F2

0x924EE0AB
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0x4DC9D392
others."
0x30705434

0x924EE0AB
"You don't show it."
0x4C3DFC0A

0x924EE0AB
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xF534615A
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x83E16398

0x924EE0AB
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x7FB1AF1F
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x174E5A00
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0xCC98B09A

0x924EE0AB
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0x2860AD55

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x49316F02

0x924EE0AB
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x178A2098
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0xA2F39323
you'd _rather_ not."
0xD584A3CD

0x924EE0AB
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0xFF24AA31
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0xC75E6A72
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xC81F199D
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x28D787D4
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0x97E200F8

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER V
0x4025C4C7

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0xB513B851
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x1C5441A6
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x175EDABB
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0x8BFB3867
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xE545B692
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x4CB32E4A
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x1FC9309C
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0xA0C95DE9
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0x2E186B3F
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0xEE239BB3
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xE3F00155
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x2B832F5A
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xA9A280C4
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x4ED65B6A
bye?"
0xD3A3BA0C

0x924EE0AB
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x8EABB6D8
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x6245C31F
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0xE8937821
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0xC7475B91

0x924EE0AB
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x4406D187

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x12CBAD68
the wall."
0xA7172F82

0x924EE0AB
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x26300517

0x924EE0AB
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0xA272FC7D
been my foe."
0xB8184111

0x924EE0AB
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xB3053E4E

0x924EE0AB
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xF3FD20B3
out at the front door.
0x6A370494

0x924EE0AB
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x8D2CEDFA
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x263FF88D
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0xBFDC0DDA
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x689FC19B
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0xC6ED2FA5
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x874F04A1
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0x1A555343
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0x67872DE7
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x44170643

0x924EE0AB
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0xE0071B07

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"And how far is it?"
0xE74BD7DC

0x924EE0AB
"Fifty miles."
0x381494C8

0x924EE0AB
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x5227C265
alone."
0x62CB6044

0x924EE0AB
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xB1F04134
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x5C80936B
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0x0E76D704
with kisses.
0xE0A954C2

0x924EE0AB
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x6E30FEB3
me into the inside.
0xFB5486C3

0x924EE0AB
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0x9B3FB87F
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0x428BB18F
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x5A55AFC0
mysterious regions.
0x300C725D

0x924EE0AB
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x2E086B7A
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x4FD178C8
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0xBB94E138
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xD966B560
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x9F662F9D
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x955A5AA6
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xB3CAB90E
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x702EF01A
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x71B05680
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x0DEAE454
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0xD77A4BFA
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xC9B3B75C
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0x8C7660DC
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0xB85F05F8
"stony street" of L-.
0xEC4F2CBA

0x924EE0AB
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x356204AD
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x5F8BF609
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x57FECC1A
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0xE95F94A1
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x50B9080F
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x8BC1518B

0x924EE0AB
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x881099E5
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x914318FB
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x2562C35B
by the light of the lamps.
0x577E5FCB

0x924EE0AB
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x25DF1F5D
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x0AB8E62E
instantly drove away.
0xF0157EE1

0x924EE0AB
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x89AC0913
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x289D08FA
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0xB9D0D113
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0xA80D0A6D
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x810C9456
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x3C98355C
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0x3F2BBCC5
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x5F9C33C4
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x7743B7BE

0x924EE0AB
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x9A0344FA
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xA811D9A3
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x0EC6A3DD
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x730219DD
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x6A41D27B
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x1422AB79
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x0401ED78

0x924EE0AB
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0xD5613E63
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0x79A7E6AD
grave, her bearing erect.
0x63A91BA8

0x924EE0AB
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0xDB6F8A82
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x33BD0539
then further added--
0xD1B0704A

0x924EE0AB
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xBDF32667
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x71168475

0x924EE0AB
"A little, ma'am."
0x678114A2

0x924EE0AB
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x63B18930
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0xC74DBDD3
come to school, my little girl?"
0x0B3FBBAD

0x924EE0AB
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x88854876
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x04C01B64
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x462439F4
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x72916617
me along with Miss Miller.
0x2D2BA585

0x924EE0AB
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x47B68D2A
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x962F50E2
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x0E1686C5
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0xEC59B8F7
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0x86266B19
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xF77204C7
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x64D3905C
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x8462B37D
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0x66507A1E
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0xD7E18968
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0xA851C8D6
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0xE2FE2A7C
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x77F8F675
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0xEF1DE067
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0xA994D2E0
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x1CB2C312
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x27A7442B
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x51A5A9E1

0x924EE0AB
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x07BE427A
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x5BF74465

0x924EE0AB
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xAB06A954

0x924EE0AB
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0x190A2B91
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x18FD6410

0x924EE0AB
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0x3DD47D57

0x924EE0AB
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x6F2857FA
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x21E983EA
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0x99C11052
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x280D55A7
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0xCE642DB9
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x637F4D74
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0xB7D15F1C

0x924EE0AB
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0xF882E1AB
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x5F2798F8
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0x1D637B4D
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x35F8DE46
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x994438B0
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0xBD480891
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x26961C5D
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x19141CE0

0x924EE0AB
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x19E477BE
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x6A3C23A0
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x1C50C2BC
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x1AFB14DC
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x66B44B9B
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x5C49B486
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x4B8D77B0
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0xB4F625B5
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x0CDA4C24
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x4BA5D8E4
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x353BEDBD
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0xFFF29E43

0x924EE0AB
"Form classes!"
0x119358E5

0x924EE0AB
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0x48F4B1F1
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0xC6833CEC
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x6EE266A2
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0x4BBF1892
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0x5F9E05C8
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0xB45427D3
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x83A9A0FA

0x924EE0AB
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0xE6B750FB
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x9897A155
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0x9A78F7AF
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xE5B1A554
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x338F7BA7

0x924EE0AB
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x50D72D29
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0x9F80A85A
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x831044CF
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0x4B332C64
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0xF3BEA110
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0x7823F051
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0xA420A675
little the day before.
0x91693493

0x924EE0AB
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x42343998
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0x2473580F
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0x62767801
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x3D9B5189
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x010828FD
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x546528C2

0x924EE0AB
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0xE2558B34

0x924EE0AB
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x0F0A6E34
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x695F6D5E
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0x8C493F62
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x16C69381
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0xF3E91428
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0xF8A512AE
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0xDF0B5AC1
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0xFD4AF681
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x7FA1CFA1
the meal began.
0xFDA38BAC

0x924EE0AB
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0x2767079D
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x0F32608E
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x26E22FC0
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0x5837D772
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xAEF89A59
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x0073D7E0
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x4EA599D1
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xD7F6BC4C
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0x659EAB8F
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x41E5EF89
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0xE9592088
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x77609DCF

0x924EE0AB
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0xF4FC45FD

0x924EE0AB
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x3E085B1B
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x72F381B1
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xDCB9ED5B
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0xF17C0030
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0xB894FD7D
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0xEA9677C8
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0x04AD02BF
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0xD0B4E93D
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0xA8E8324F
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0xA1413432

0x924EE0AB
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x8A3C6127
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x01A1B579

0x924EE0AB
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0xA9EBB660

0x924EE0AB
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0x2848AA27
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x1A47B111
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x9D44615C
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x187657D1
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x8D2BD305
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x5D6C284A
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xF0A7312E
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0xDDB7715B
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0xF914FF43
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x87B270B2
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0xC0E18C37
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0x22F14537
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x27C2EDCC

0x924EE0AB
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x90386334
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x76DB2A9B
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0xEBE3CB03
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0xFF2F914E
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x99D00CED
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0xEB8BB317

0x924EE0AB
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x6975515E
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0xE79AA4A1
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x11EA34E7
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0xAE5D0028
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0x6310F731
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x23FA31BE
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0xE74D5027
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x1F902728

0x924EE0AB
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0xA6D090C4

0x924EE0AB
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x1124A4FD
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0x13C7C763
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0xDC7754FF
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0x6C731DD2
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0xE1364011
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0x78411E47
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x269F6C54
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x380ABEC1
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0x648F2031
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x52809DA3
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0xDA628CA2
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0x75F7C47D
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xD6BD411F
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x6312450B
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x608C205B
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0xAE145FBC

0x924EE0AB
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x629E4B92
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0xF828B948
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x353D0DBE
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x5CA2C6EC
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x2261E437
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x9E06E6E1
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xDBC34209
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0xEE7D4B2C

0x924EE0AB
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xF36D5B33

0x924EE0AB
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x0D64685F
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x4DEDB705

0x924EE0AB
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x60AB0D06
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x98AA636D
to all."
0x9227DECE

0x924EE0AB
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x61469B5D

0x924EE0AB
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x2AAA18D2
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xF00F552B

0x924EE0AB
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0xDCC940F3
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0xC463440F
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x4E2988B9
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x5D8A648B
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x38646CE7

0x924EE0AB
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x92773E28
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0xC1902B53
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x3AD01A1D
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0x5AAD4C2E
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0x8AB07A2A
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0xA1B2F3F9
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0x23BF8AB3
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0xF15A4DB5
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xFF1BA7AD
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x482DEBB8
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xB5290961
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x4CA6BE58
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0xC908D3F5
hollow cough.
0x2238F27B

0x924EE0AB
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0xDE9229E3
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0x2E5A308B
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x4FBB10B4
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0x0011A597
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xEEBFA67B
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x894481F8
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0xEF873B6C
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x882A09E8
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x01A1A2B0
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0xEEF55322
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0xFDBBB35C
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x4E4C4608
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xBE1C9E2A
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0x6291F0D1
this inscription:--
0x08C7D26D

0x924EE0AB
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0x966652CC
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0xA4E9D31F
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x223029AD
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x83615B33

0x924EE0AB
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0xF70D3EA3
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x96B4C875
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x530E2C75
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0x438ADA54
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x1ED12BD9
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0xEC4F1895
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0xBC6055B8
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0x3E218489
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x5D37B7DA
I said to her directly--
0xD7D52FC8

0x924EE0AB
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0xD8CBD75E
her to lend it to me some day.
0x7A26B859

0x924EE0AB
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x9F17A51D
she examined me.
0x5166EE4A

0x924EE0AB
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0xD5A088E4
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x0B62B4C8
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x2D2B1BEB
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0xFF564893
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x175E43C3
or substantial.
0x3E56605B

0x924EE0AB
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x5E4F9DCF

0x924EE0AB
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0x05749F5F
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0xA8D01C85
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0xDB29EF91
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x80193354
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0xBF58B6E7
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xE32BBD6B

0x924EE0AB
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0xB131C5CD
is Lowood Institution?"
0x901A02AF

0x924EE0AB
"This house where you are come to live."
0xCCA155E2

0x924EE0AB
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0xE133242D
other schools?"
0xCAD942E0

0x924EE0AB
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0xB1570183
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x5D841358
father or your mother dead?"
0x61337BCF

0x924EE0AB
"Both died before I can remember."
0x8C6854D4

0x924EE0AB
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0xA984DB9E
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0x14E7038A

0x924EE0AB
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0x4D2F37B7

0x924EE0AB
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0xBDAE4FEF

0x924EE0AB
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0xA0D0A0B9

0x924EE0AB
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0xB0163B27
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0x8F4AF69A

0x924EE0AB
"Who subscribes?"
0xBDAB5C2A

0x924EE0AB
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0xF623F6AD
and in London."
0x4C53EC3B

0x924EE0AB
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0x3B6D471D

0x924EE0AB
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0x428543E1
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0xBBEB5205

0x924EE0AB
"Why?"
0x1DD0B2F4

0x924EE0AB
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x5A95ABC9

0x924EE0AB
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x22C411B9
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0xB46C607F

0x924EE0AB
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0x97619280
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0xD0E9E4EE
all our clothes."
0x023227A8

0x924EE0AB
"Does he live here?"
0x13EAFDD0

0x924EE0AB
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0x820ED9B5

0x924EE0AB
"Is he a good man?"
0xA1C740B0

0x924EE0AB
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0xB644FCBB

0x924EE0AB
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0xE0DBCF5F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0x2E085F08

0x924EE0AB
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0xE1207D27
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0x61A908B8
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0x52259FF2
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0x8053765A
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0x66D5448B
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0xA65D5DD2
teaches French."
0x5C00B935

0x924EE0AB
"Do you like the teachers?"
0x67C3247D

0x924EE0AB
"Well enough."
0x615838C8

0x924EE0AB
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x0E4DA9BA
pronounce her name as you do."
0x4BE28D3D

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0x21D26656
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0xFE877797

0x924EE0AB
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x1CAD5547

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0x6DE6D1D3
she knows far more than they do."
0x76832C30

0x924EE0AB
"Have you been long here?"
0x45D85506

0x924EE0AB
"Two years."
0xEDB57060

0x924EE0AB
"Are you an orphan?"
0x61A68499

0x924EE0AB
"My mother is dead."
0x8ABA9A7E

0x924EE0AB
"Are you happy here?"
0x9888D04D

0x924EE0AB
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0xC0C9A105
the present: now I want to read."
0xB89A0FCD

0x924EE0AB
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xEC9B6CD8
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0xD8FEA107
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0x1C34163F
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x13777EA9
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0xCA8921D4
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0xAE8063BE
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x00D5E8A3
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x167B739A
day's fare would be like this.
0xEF98ACCF

0x924EE0AB
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x2045E1A4
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x8F965086

0x924EE0AB
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0xD0297110
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x2C252559
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x51C7B055
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x3ACA37F2
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x1F85A08F
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x5706F19B
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0xBA8A5669
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0xB5EB7B46
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0xB0D82406
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0x689A117A
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0xAEFA5D5E
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x9F8B2D80
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xA0681190
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x17F02052
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x606A0491
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xF543F84C

0x924EE0AB
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xED5A8BE8
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xC9927BFB
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0xC1A0AACB
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x08AAB1AB
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x07067DE2
first day at Lowood.
0x1E68B78E

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER VI
0x42426623

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0x8B21CC13
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0xC0139E0B
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0x5B0C7513
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x31AACB52
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x4F7F6D3D
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0x3D2FBB0B

0x924EE0AB
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x80BDD76C
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0xB1643D83
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x008D9C9B
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0x25C854B0

0x924EE0AB
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x4624A748
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x6C165E72
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0xF62A12C4
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xF5DD34EC
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x92864336
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0xB4F3B1C4
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x9739E403
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x81013ADE
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x61C28F61
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x5E0B21D4
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0xFAC2A330
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0xE4A4C405
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0x394A9F34
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0xC29D5F4B
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0xA34501B2
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0xC57D2612
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0x0A728741
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x63F77A24
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0xD08D2C55
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x58F8F76C

0x924EE0AB
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x58F69C0C
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xF8938D9F
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0xDEC86BDD
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0xE630191E
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x11B707CB
&c. &c.
0xB46BC20D

0x924EE0AB
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x34A7E5AA
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x1CD6575E
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0x254C2564
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0xA3A57FBB
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0xC1F2E122
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0x1E3DCF13
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0x47367037
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x4A83DBD4

0x924EE0AB
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0xFE2DF2CA
morning!"
0xC3EB0ABD

0x924EE0AB
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x2A42E594
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x632BF94C
as the water was frozen?"
0xFB699655

0x924EE0AB
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0x66355573
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0xFE88FBE4
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0x9A819A48
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x94CA67CE
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0xB3B38839
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xF7FB0149
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x685FE886
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x723FB844
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0xEBF3F575
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xF5A23486
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xFCC775B4
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0xAAF6FA64
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0xF40CB9F8
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x5CF9A644
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x4C140E1A
altered its ordinary expression.
0xCA4D8607

0x924EE0AB
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x6087F808
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0xD11CCA8B

0x924EE0AB
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0xBD5AF134
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0xD7200884
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x97204EC8

0x924EE0AB
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0xC15F28FA
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0x82B9DB2F
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x44994E2A
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x7EE1F237
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0xFB8CB87E
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x30D2C33B
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x82AFB400
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xB7FC53F1

0x924EE0AB
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x3B2F55EA
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x4AC44CC7
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0xCFA50F1B
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x2E880ABC
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0xE3ECCD91
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x9A193C61
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x1455AB0E

0x924EE0AB
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x2F1C069F
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x1E566B7A
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x74B51DB2
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x373A9489
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x3B4942B7
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0x7ABC685C
to clamour.
0x0F04719F

0x924EE0AB
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x4C01566D
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0xAA3ABD23
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x9B7E7AE1
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0xA228AF10

0x924EE0AB
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x548E0F98

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0x5C8BC4AD

0x924EE0AB
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x6473E4FB
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x196ACEA1
floor.
0x3BEFE58F

0x924EE0AB
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x0025077D

0x924EE0AB
"Helen."
0xA6662406

0x924EE0AB
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x79A6BCEB

0x924EE0AB
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0xDC219FE9

0x924EE0AB
"Will you ever go back?"
0x57BE3075

0x924EE0AB
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0xBC05E5A5

0x924EE0AB
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x03154775

0x924EE0AB
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x3B54A176
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x65BBF682

0x924EE0AB
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x303559C1

0x924EE0AB
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x19D69287

0x924EE0AB
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x9666DB44
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x0BDAB415
break it under her nose."
0x12808B46

0x924EE0AB
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x184588DA
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x7010F845
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0xBAD9AB13
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0xD53A749D
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x5E52770D
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0xF0F7A8C7

0x924EE0AB
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xF2A76B84
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0xCAE91D53
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0xF69B3F9C

0x924EE0AB
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0xC2EA0B27
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x37D74431
required to bear."
0xC251A11F

0x924EE0AB
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0x69EC8389
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x5CB2A36C
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x5E1B28B1
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0x1CF0B234
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x21D26DED
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x860EA3F4

0x924EE0AB
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0x7CEDC257
good."
0x7BDC9D16

0x924EE0AB
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x307F9EAA
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x6040CAE3
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xC27305FB
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x05832A8E
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x7D249B88
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0xBB6214FC

0x924EE0AB
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0x05937B4A
addition: she kept silence.
0x6C333039

0x924EE0AB
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x46CA0A25

0x924EE0AB
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0xD399A739
grave face.
0xF968CFE6

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x2C080DFA
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x268D8758
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x69181D61
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x77F62AF4
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0x3D8D4F5E
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0xF5F18282
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0xD195F270

0x924EE0AB
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0xA8A7AB4C

0x924EE0AB
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0x9578CED7
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0x334C092D
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xD2B67085
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x80171E86
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0x1038E065
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x6F41586B
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0x3B38AB30
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x1979B8E9
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0xFFAEB4F9
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x74E4BF00
answer ready."
0xA5605E0A

0x924EE0AB
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x2C143C50

0x924EE0AB
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xFEEAA1D0
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x46E5A87D
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0xDBECE88C
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x635DF317
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0x497DDB5B
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x025F456E
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0xACA1C4FC
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0xE044792E
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x0A3E2ED9
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0xD1A65A08

0x924EE0AB
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0xA3469259
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x03A26AF7
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x1078BFD1

0x924EE0AB
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0x7AC965E8

0x924EE0AB
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x9AB579BB
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x800BA4AE
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x0047C357
I wished to gain."
0xF5089E49

0x924EE0AB
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0x12361752

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0xD04C4996
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0xADA38BA7

0x924EE0AB
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x64BB1A7C
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x03BC1A3C
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x29CD16F6
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xA89C9428
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0xAFE6B40B
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0xFD7B47F5
person who struck us never to do it again."
0x2FF8CA4D

0x924EE0AB
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0xB4636B45
but a little untaught girl."
0xC60B4739

0x924EE0AB
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x06B23416
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0xF4D610B3
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0x70752AB8
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0xF82CF217

0x924EE0AB
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0x96657913
civilised nations disown it."
0x31AB5DF0

0x924EE0AB
"How?  I don't understand."
0xB5B4B055

0x924EE0AB
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0x9E282A2D
certainly heals injury."
0x63C6B5C4

0x924EE0AB
"What then?"
0x6E857B8E

0x924EE0AB
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0x68D30D9F
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0xC2D0592F

0x924EE0AB
"What does He say?"
0x48E05708

0x924EE0AB
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0xC6010832
you and despitefully use you."
0x72731079

0x924EE0AB
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0xB8528EF1
John, which is impossible."
0x7B22A3FD

0x924EE0AB
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0x86B3A494
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0xEA035235
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x1B0A3753
softening.
0x738328FD

0x924EE0AB
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0x9AC2983E
remark, but she said nothing.
0x9CC98F53

0x924EE0AB
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0xA9C5CA49
woman?"
0xC912F4F5

0x924EE0AB
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0xD8F88926
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x22EFDE4C
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x3A2621B8
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x259118B8
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0xAF4158EA
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xCFF2466A
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x932FE91B
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x1A95A496
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x73D01D28
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xF7859741
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x1C18EA38
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x02B5ACBD
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x831202BB
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x9C484122
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0xC3568721
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x942E358A
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xD4DE1908
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0xB937D67F
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0xBF2B119D
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0x040F4CFA
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0x03B7B54E
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x84A5A307
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0xC747809C
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x382DACC1
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x5902E06B

0x924EE0AB
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0x4E24E2AF
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xB1FAF921
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0xFB7A63BC
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x2654A025
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0xD869CFA1

0x924EE0AB
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0xDA860437
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x3CD4D0CB

0x924EE0AB
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x7E8E2A9A
without reply as without delay.
0x6BF53B43

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER VII
0x85FD134E

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x6C59E0B6
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0xBCB4D410
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x52DDC94A
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x87D531F1
were no trifles.
0x9E76C2DB

0x924EE0AB
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0xCE1F450F
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x64C112B0
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0xB4D209A2
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x19BDCE01
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x8DBE10C3
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0xDB45D034
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x8E68A0B8
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x120CBA97
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x5731DE34
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x8F93CEC3
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0xBDE9512B
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0xE3B68356
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x1716B08F
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x0A30A624
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xED835C81
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x210C484B
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x34EA8265
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0xDD26B35B
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x6184144C

0x924EE0AB
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x8777F3B5
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0xB30F462C
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x7E675B3F
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0xF600AA7D
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x666FE6EE
meals, was served round between the services.
0xC870FEAB

0x924EE0AB
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x23742FC0
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xE9FFE2AF
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x09FCD41F

0x924EE0AB
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0xC65A9B6C
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0x3C00256B
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x1F7240B9
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x951F7E02
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x24D27E57
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0xA4A24407

0x924EE0AB
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0x0A3EE5BC
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0xDB2C38C4
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0x0CB7FB08
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xEC47AE33
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x771CD4DD

0x924EE0AB
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0xB7C47D29
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x9CF95CE2
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0x28F538A0
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0xD7B50ED0
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x0E907904
invariably obliged to part with.
0x408FC02B

0x924EE0AB
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x2AC8FA56
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x0DD33356
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0x9F2BDE8A
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x94338FA9
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0xE0778F78
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x293B18C4
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x1149C8CD
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x7E9011A6
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x4C25AB99
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x9A0C874F
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0x8DA717D7

0x924EE0AB
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0xF4616C8B
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0x61D03FB9
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0x1742F47F
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0xA3EE2A6D
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x75A980F7

0x924EE0AB
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xB3DE6BB3
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xB34A54F4
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x8D4FE621
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0xA2B1C501
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x90A326D0
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x3503DC7A
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x9280EFCF
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0xCE3A511C
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0x5D735C7B
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0xB1464FD2
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x5832DC4C
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0xE637092E

0x924EE0AB
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0x550C33F9
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0xAEEB00AA
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0xF9EE3DC6
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0x264B8EE7
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0x670683B4
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x99A0735F
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0xE711510F

0x924EE0AB
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x1933951F
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x9E1ADE96
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x415B848B
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xD95FE97E
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x014CBC89
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xAE8A427F

0x924EE0AB
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x065EC9A4
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0xBCCDDBFD
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x08862A7F
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x70C93EA5
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xAE7078EB
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x736A6079
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x9F4BF7E0
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0xFCD237A3
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0xBC78A13E
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x7E53AF86
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0x75D22A10

0x924EE0AB
He paused.
0x86745502

0x924EE0AB
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x8DD05BFB

0x924EE0AB
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xE053CFA6
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x77EE62F2
to one."
0x0F16744F

0x924EE0AB
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x207900A4
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0xD398843D
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x3420212B
occasion."
0x825F84B8

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0xA3BABC40

0x924EE0AB
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0x0ABEEA3C
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x782CCC47
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0xE1EC6CC3
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0xB178EEDE
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0xBF1B3E29
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0x4641AF93
what authority?"
0x9FFB17DD

0x924EE0AB
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xBA728B9D
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0xCCA1227B
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0xCD46488A

0x924EE0AB
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x05DC2D28
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x0B1D5058
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0xC5AE96D0
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0xF3EA8FED
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0xEE0199F5
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0xDB9D2201
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0xE39D0EDD
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x0C272337
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0x4FC5FDA5
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0xF1B331A0
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x8FADA771
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xDEFC3DE5
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0xF3A87828
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x114F30AC
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0x63B5039F
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0xB3016515
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x1FCEABEC
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x76D44A31
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x38B88763

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x6C577571
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x21582ED2
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0xFD3B5769
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x89382897
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0xF43B6A1F
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x51A2F1CF
severity.
0x9352ADF7

0x924EE0AB
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xC5563CAC
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x075A80A2
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0xA3A0CBF6
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xB6CFA918

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0x0219F995
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x464BE119
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x737F0ACE

0x924EE0AB
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x172FC40F

0x924EE0AB
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0xAD9BEBCB
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0xEB3AE292
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xB4061C43
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0xA71F97A7

0x924EE0AB
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0xD1CA0BDA

0x924EE0AB
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0xACCC7933
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0xA58D3F84
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0xFB00427F
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0xC5BD7778
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x450DA32F
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0xCA4CE48B
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0x0CAFE2C3

0x924EE0AB
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x218698F8
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x4A845C7F
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x8C3BBB84
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0xE2ECCF36
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0xA28ABB4F
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0x034DF89B
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x277C8143
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x9A5CB5AD

0x924EE0AB
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x36647C83
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0x296478D7

0x924EE0AB
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0xA01C1B91

0x924EE0AB
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0x702D7606

0x924EE0AB
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0x4E9F798C
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0xBD16975A
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0x927A7E3B
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0x78215BB6
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0xCFFCD009
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0xD9DB1158
time wasted, of--"
0xAE828EC7

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0xE0851277
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x880F2FB4
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x63B2452E
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x0B306D74
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0xC8C61866
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x99098D40
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0xB379E8C3
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x3816E26C
false front of French curls.
0xBBE0BA41

0x924EE0AB
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x8C2A2E46
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x06A55D6F
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0xF794E04E
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x67081794
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x5886AE75
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x4D7070B8
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x34039D34
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0x7093DC00
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0xE00DE32E
my attention.
0x4BD9B6EB

0x924EE0AB
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x6B0F729E
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x193FB6BE
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0xE56A1C2A
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xD4180A23
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x30BA2121
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x3BA51B2B
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xDF1106A8
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xA3E7A8F2
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0xA82FB51E
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x352E8EDE

0x924EE0AB
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x38DDF824
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x90ADD65F
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x30B1DB54
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x93FE62C8

0x924EE0AB
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0xE6205273
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0xF72EF89B
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x92CCCE8C
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xA191D43B

0x924EE0AB
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0x9ADD2E19
punished."
0x67120571

0x924EE0AB
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x64550D41

0x924EE0AB
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x539064CB
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x2772E6BA
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x6FCF6BA7

0x924EE0AB
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0xBAB24473
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0xFBE75CFC

0x924EE0AB
"Place the child upon it."
0xE50A5614

0x924EE0AB
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x65217F11
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x930EF855
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0x5F4690DD
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x2AFCDF16
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x56C57032

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0xE4D71D9B

0x924EE0AB
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0xC3CF1B14
children, you all see this girl?"
0x5C4FCFA4

0x924EE0AB
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0xB0550B84
against my scorched skin.
0x18858523

0x924EE0AB
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x3E3F1FC8
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x03021DB6
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x69FA8D92
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0x1EDC630D
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x1F3E686D

0x924EE0AB
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xEBF0D293
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xDB50770C
must be firmly sustained.
0xC21B0E46

0x924EE0AB
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0xA9D3124F
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x490C7403
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0x331D1D3D
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0x356574FC
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x2E995ED7
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x9EDF3C32
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0xD3929D23
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x46EB0340
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0x4255084D
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0xF255CC89
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x1FC6CD49
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x2F721E96

0x924EE0AB
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0xE5B83EDC
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x40D7BEDA
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x1C9EA9A7
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0xD9445146
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xB4AB0AA3

0x924EE0AB
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0xE063B1BD
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0x60AC8DD2
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0x3447754D
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0x20CBFE8D
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x98935357
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0xDD0E18DD
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0xFED2852A
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0xEB653817
waters to stagnate round her."
0x7456B522

0x924EE0AB
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0xB0184DC7
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x91ACE6AC
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x946708D5
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x3D5EA884

0x924EE0AB
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0xB4832973
her during the remainder of the day."
0x484F0F6B

0x924EE0AB
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0xE9C80691
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0xE76E1E1A
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0xF5B902F8
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0xDF47D431
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x1394F819
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x8B415FD5
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xCA49F3E7
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0xBCC34EFF
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x709C6F5D
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x9E4855BF
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x0AAEEE16
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0xA0D81352
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x017E4D2A
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0xDBEE7F2C
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0xC24C9168
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x37D17A2C
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0xCF758A6E
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xAAC859AF
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x1F4FA9F2
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xDC8A83F3
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x118C7766
the full brightness of the orb.
0x30B1F6C3

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER VIII
0x70393B54

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x17C307F8
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x0741B4E8
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0xC2E3D2D3
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x87B80B5B
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x3FF5F6BB
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0x0005CDE6
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0xBB9681EF
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0xE72C3F0E
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x1C6D7971
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0xA31423FC
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0xA667CEBB
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x97CC0B6F
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x155F309F
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0xE1537E53
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0xFC33ECF6
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xA16C3915

0x924EE0AB
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0xB0EA6282
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x20B11761
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x29FB4417
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x17E058C4

0x924EE0AB
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x74B0C385
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0x7F343592
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x86FB58A6
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x2FD13DA2
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0x77801257
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0xA01E4585
first who spoke--
0xF0DB5D10

0x924EE0AB
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xFC6E4CE4
liar?"
0x9AEBFB7F

0x924EE0AB
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x033D60B2
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x5FD1D40E

0x924EE0AB
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xA3E6367F

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0xC887D56F
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0xBBEFAD00

0x924EE0AB
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x840FD80C

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x6A557815
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0xA46E75C0
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x45CC18C7
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x72033907
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0x17CF3562
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0xC2EC78B5
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0xA50B5A0F
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0xA244463B
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0xE7798C20

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0xD7E5EEC3
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xC3ACCA1F

0x924EE0AB
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0xC09E221D
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0xBB156435
without friends."
0x600473F4

0x924EE0AB
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x267BB4DE
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x3E04AEA2
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xE8AC8D5F
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x9955FFCE
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x2AF10437
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0xDA78D5DC

0x924EE0AB
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x5A5358D2
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x10666A86
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0xBF04BC6E
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0xE7EC02DA
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x5C1D7A1A
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x2A8C21B6
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x831D3933
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0xECFD99C0
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x7ADF8153
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x6DA08854
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0xC6DF4FC4
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0xE8856F3F
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x373B5F4A
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0xEDE93404
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xF2F02705

0x924EE0AB
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x36808D1B
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x0ECFDD28
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xEBB808F6
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0x1C1FD4E2
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x4DEBF2B9

0x924EE0AB
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0x463CF69F
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x4875B545
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0xAEF3B1B3
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0x4576128A
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0x83FDFC9C
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0xB234FDB2

0x924EE0AB
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xC08DCB2B
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x2A69B5AC

0x924EE0AB
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0xCC99A476
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0xCA5F8A45
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xF5F0D864
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x43C097C6
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x2FD7A3B0

0x924EE0AB
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x081315B2
your grief away?"
0xCEB98E4D

0x924EE0AB
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0xDED7BA6A

0x924EE0AB
"Why?"
0x1DD0B2F4

0x924EE0AB
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x59A8BB15
will now think me wicked."
0xF97DA3AA

0x924EE0AB
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x7B852DC2
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0x287E8125

0x924EE0AB
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x002F83E3

0x924EE0AB
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xE90E49F6
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x898201B8

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x627C7B0B
care."
0x435F90B1

0x924EE0AB
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0xB99915D5

0x924EE0AB
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0x37AFB964
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0xCA99C666
always keep me."
0xB112BE27

0x924EE0AB
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xF69A3083
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0xE31A78DF
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x5B06A0A3
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0xEFA5FC71
exaggerate nothing."
0x27148C25

0x924EE0AB
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x0A814C29
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0xBE67651A
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0xADAC4AC2
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0xC1030626
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0xF253B0CB
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x49414523
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0x4493943A
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x96076D4C
Temple fully believed me.
0x59411624

0x924EE0AB
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0xE6D7ADF8
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0x2AC0E5FD
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x81782ED5
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x742C513E
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x14CBC21D
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0xD6CC189E

0x924EE0AB
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0xBAF79F82
then said--
0x2B8CC022

0x924EE0AB
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x4BA73424
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x31227C3F
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x29E33646

0x924EE0AB
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x51B55798
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x83CDE7D0
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x74257A95
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0x358DA4B5
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xC1727C7D

0x924EE0AB
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x53BFAD37

0x924EE0AB
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0xA895A2CE

0x924EE0AB
"And the pain in your chest?"
0xD6CE76D9

0x924EE0AB
"It is a little better."
0x07A1F60D

0x924EE0AB
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x34B493F3
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xF618023F
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0xE6DACF93

0x924EE0AB
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xC2248259
rang her bell.
0xCABC743B

0x924EE0AB
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0xD93C2975
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0xC2E31C5B

0x924EE0AB
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0x9ACFBE52
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0xF2DA3089
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x79BBDD15
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0xE9A2AB15
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x552BE778

0x924EE0AB
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xFC78AAF4
There is not enough for three."
0x959F903A

0x924EE0AB
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0x2002828A

0x924EE0AB
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x42AE6DC9

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x120BBB27
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0xBA27C1FB

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x6DE2AF22
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0xD1226940
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x793953F5

0x924EE0AB
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0xBD140BDD
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0x0C66B0B7
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x051FC4A1
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x234D29DB

0x924EE0AB
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0xBE553F0D
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x9F4733B5
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x92F80BBB

0x924EE0AB
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x0ED5644A
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x2941381A
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x91FCF92A
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0xB5ECE039

0x924EE0AB
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xB010DC94
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0x3F9A78E6
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0xD654C26E

0x924EE0AB
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x695A0DC1
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0xDFABA205
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0xC769C4A7
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x307A9A3A
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x16DCAA69
struck with wonder.
0x8E2F189F

0x924EE0AB
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0xC4B14471
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x143F4051
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0xCF36E256
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0xA1F64D64
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x2B70FD8E
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0x58600C78
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x4CE396AD
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0xCF7F4444
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x333C65DC
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x53D088DA
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0x8311002F
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0xA4D0C7D0
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x0E561A99
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0xBB741D04

0x924EE0AB
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0xF810E5D1
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0xCB7D0435
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0xE5A27C9B
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0x5EA99C01
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x3CB4331E
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xB5D0104A
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x02571738
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0xBE25D2AA
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0xD06015C9
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xE6936AC3
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x7F678846

0x924EE0AB
"God bless you, my children!"
0x0527B13C

0x924EE0AB
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0x7FC01879
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x6EA9436F
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x00B5A824

0x924EE0AB
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x890D83A8
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0xC3813B17
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x2C939E7D
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x83D9E503
shoulder.
0x6A854ADC

0x924EE0AB
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x9D4EA1E9
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x412051CB

0x924EE0AB
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x16216175
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x09B6E261
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x920976C7
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x3D98C1C6
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x9B6D2D60
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0x25D827E7
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x6520D98F
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x51CEBC0F
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0x1084925B

0x924EE0AB
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0xA38CA0C2
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x001FD592
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x4A3795B8
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x6DBAC098
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xB5ACE47B
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x0CFA0944
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x6F084A3A
through the ranks of my companions.
0x6F67FF73

0x924EE0AB
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x84AD7643
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0x99840CE5
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0xEFB8DDA9
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x16BF6478
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0xE8CC0727
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x2E373CDE
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x634E2229
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x10034D27
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x18AADA59
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x0B7B63A6
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0xC8B94690
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x463EEE52
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0x10AA9D5C
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x8A71949B
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0x7949803A
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0xDB6D756F
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0x525FE697
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0xF84D6B0F
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0xA492AC31
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0x653B853E

0x924EE0AB
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0x6E04477E
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x7F6B50B9

0x924EE0AB
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0xFDA7ED13
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER IX
0x121AFC27

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x08BD9CB0
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0x6464D51B
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xC85B3684
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x71524091
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x8ED1E5D8
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x10FCD40D
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0xAD882378
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x46B02E4D
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x9875E3D3
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x73EE1ED9
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0xC5259188
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x2C55579B
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x170D5376
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0xD0436E68

0x924EE0AB
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0x36E0ACEB
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x15D80387
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x12CCD0EF
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x4799AD80
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x38095461
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0xCF3D4A94
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0xA560A781
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0x2219F803
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x1DDADD73
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0xC12B6573
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0xD715AEA7
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x72B49B69
of skeletons.
0x8F26DDBC

0x924EE0AB
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0xB3572F6C
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x56E86D43
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x3097FCD3
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x22FB44F3
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x286044CC
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xCA1FE9FC
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0xE555D61E
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xBC8836DA
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x8BEE1CFA
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x3BCFDEAF
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x9480CCBC
advert.
0x9E62AF4D

0x924EE0AB
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x0A59A45E
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x4A954153
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0xE1FBF138
question.
0xA99B339F

0x924EE0AB
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0xB037306F
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0x861757B8
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x6F201789
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x01BBC735
hospital.
0xE6506FD7

0x924EE0AB
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x4DECF27D
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x1A3BA522
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x8D0B20DE
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xA7D27B80
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x5033A23F
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0x989EEF28
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x550C1D1C
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x78630292
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x7E149F87
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x94ABC0D8
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0x6FB9ED93
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x55468E44
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0x3514DD12
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0xA96A1BB6

0x924EE0AB
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x32955C75
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x596B7ACD
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x04217488
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0x7FEED662
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0xE5DC5045
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0xF6EC12CE
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0x2433739E
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0xF2816B63
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x256BDF3D
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x5D1EE2C3
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xFC19F93A
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0x8D06D9A8

0x924EE0AB
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x43D90CBE
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x03D2F306
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x96B5ECD6
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x068B491F
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0x335D473D
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0xF7960C81
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x664E00FA
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x34E9C79F
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x78BDC11C
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x820675B4
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0xD2BDB0DF
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0xD2CE278A
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x6C80AF7C

0x924EE0AB
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0xA6AC9F49
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x1CBC8B82
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xC62F0668
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0xBBB6B708
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0x1295E029
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xD6FD80FE
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0xDD6CA12F
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0xF95C9AEE
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x83195AB9
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x627F4115
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x39A97E32
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x9F7EA60F
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0xB33176C0

0x924EE0AB
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x8B458AD4
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xDC44EBB4
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0xD8EDC9DD
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x8F4F89FD
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x64747B9A
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x01713397
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0xD7DE188F
higher things.
0xCE1A96BE

0x924EE0AB
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0xEF91AA89
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0x47785096
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x07417617
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0xAA5B077A
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0xB9E2DD63
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0x93F2B84B
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x768F48F2
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0x6396A8B4
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0xC9964B1B
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x6EEA8849
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0xF7A93D1C
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x148D1B90
alleviate.
0x2850B288

0x924EE0AB
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0x5C5F38B2
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x803C9DCF
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x7EF3BE05
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0xD5AA753E
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x3D0857E2
verandah.
0xA48BCD93

0x924EE0AB
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0xAD46C30E
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x5C324C88
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x180CD865
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0xC4D34EA4
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0x5B9CAD4D
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x90E22582
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x07D45C3A
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0xD58A39BE
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x8D0D5590
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x85095DDC
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x2BCF8215
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x8D588EB7
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0x1D77CFE1
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0xBC991A48
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x767E7A10
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x0C002F96
done before:--
0x4AAC70C1

0x924EE0AB
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x6EBC9E2D
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x44CE4BD2
have to go who knows where?"
0xBBED9C77

0x924EE0AB
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0xEE608936
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x00C4DB0A
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x1577F08A
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0x8DBFD0F6
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x2046F9A7
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x8C59DE1A
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x96A51DB2
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x77E32F41
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0xFCD8235A
ran up to her.
0x4080FF1F

0x924EE0AB
"How is Helen Burns?"
0xF8ABAE78

0x924EE0AB
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xD678C9CF

0x924EE0AB
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0xA9FF16FC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"And what does he say about her?"
0xDD37DB67

0x924EE0AB
"He says she'll not be here long."
0xF44FF829

0x924EE0AB
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xC1587FD0
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x356FD772
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xEE85E15A
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0x38A66599
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xAA0478BB
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xD4C32446
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x507E03BE
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x698EC96E

0x924EE0AB
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0xF16CE06B

0x924EE0AB
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x79F6597D

0x924EE0AB
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x0F777C4E
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0xDFD9206B

0x924EE0AB
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x7BEFFDD0
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x28FFCD58
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xEAC0194B

0x924EE0AB
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x503B400B
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0xD914A70A
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0xD9B29D42
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x4687E488
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x8D8E6668
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x4EB1D3D4
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x1FFC7C51
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0xD161E464
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0x24CE2B75
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x8C1ACBF3
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x130F030F
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x28FAB4AC
with her one last word.
0xED0E3AEB

0x924EE0AB
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x813CD20F
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0x726D5EE5
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xA7877F16
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0xF6FF5BE0
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x58029554
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0xA7222257
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x8605A5A9
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x5C862677
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x145A6A10

0x924EE0AB
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x32AF33E2
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0xFB0851AB
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x05A07C62
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0xA22550FF
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xC7068BB3
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x5F0371C8
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0xD4C764B8
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0xB5560AED
of seeing a corpse.
0xC028B13A

0x924EE0AB
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xEA26A7BC

0x924EE0AB
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x70197664
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0xE80AFEB2
instantly dissipated.
0xEB0D014F

0x924EE0AB
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0x8664D669

0x924EE0AB
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x644E1483
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xFEA85709

0x924EE0AB
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0xE9D96521
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0xD4DBB0DD
old.
0x698249E9

0x924EE0AB
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xD8A51C8B
strike some minutes since."
0x141758FD

0x924EE0AB
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0xB7BFEAB2
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0xA8BD5879

0x924EE0AB
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xC6E99E33

0x924EE0AB
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x369BBAD9

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0xCA1BBE3D

0x924EE0AB
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x6D287A5F
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x226101B0
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x55AA2467
whispered--
0xF5DDEA4F

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0xAC4D0561
quilt."
0x16DC2F51

0x924EE0AB
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xE7A1F720
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0x771752C8

0x924EE0AB
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xEE727AFF
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x8B1F9B33
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x71615428
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x2BA0E306
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xEEEE6376
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0xA7B3699D
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0x72871AC1
been continually at fault."
0xD1BEE934

0x924EE0AB
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xE2D640F9

0x924EE0AB
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0x1482DF9E

0x924EE0AB
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x2B098047

0x924EE0AB
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0x7E53597B
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0xFD9F7C33
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x0375B944
reveal Him to me."
0xF3653F10

0x924EE0AB
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0x14A17514
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0x2346E578

0x924EE0AB
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0xA8726981
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0xC69CE46E
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0x46B9AAB9

0x924EE0AB
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x161F4114

0x924EE0AB
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0xC8FB638D
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x01C569B6

0x924EE0AB
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0xF937B542
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x51D58B22
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x21F281B5
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0x002E58BB
tone--
0x04287D69

0x924EE0AB
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0x8802F558
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x62A932BD
near me."
0xB0A3BE65

0x924EE0AB
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xF0F25F37

0x924EE0AB
"Are you warm, darling?"
0xF1CCCCAE

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Good-night, Jane."
0x3D7E63B9

0x924EE0AB
"Good-night, Helen."
0xEF4D8400

0x924EE0AB
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0x2C8CF8C0

0x924EE0AB
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x521F17ED
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x0FD172B5
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x29822C88
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x1E1D4AE2
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0xA4122946
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0xEEEBE787
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x05E90F66
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xE3627F0D

0x924EE0AB
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xFF5F8C99
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x6D74B10F
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

CHAPTER X
0xB1F337AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0xB2A8594A
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x27E30BDF
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0xA43C7E1C
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x39DB6DBB
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x50185DC2
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0xE5176818
connection.
0x138D5973

0x924EE0AB
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xA3D08DB0
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x54CDC35E
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x41CFCCB9
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x9776205B
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0xD4FB4A7A
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0xA27B58FB
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x407500FD
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x1665E9F0
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xF8CF6782
beneficial to the institution.
0x1B614E98

0x924EE0AB
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x34AB590A
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x0A434537
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0xDDECD5B1
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0xFA9BCB94
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0x3D792609
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x938177DC
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0xDE1ED351
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0x744E739A
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0xD75DC2D8
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x50720EAC
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x38692843
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xED307C91
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0xB6932412
testimony to its value and importance.
0x702252D7

0x924EE0AB
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xB7119850
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x52C1AA1C
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0xE48E14BA
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0xC1768581
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0xE800F389
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0xE20EB642
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xD823AEA0
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xD06F5A21

0x924EE0AB
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x9019AF33
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0xB00F82FB
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0xE00A1574
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xDD3809AD
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x94E6DD4F
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0xE066D1AB
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0x5F7956A1

0x924EE0AB
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x520383E4
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x346021B9
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0xBB03B1E2
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0xD468274F
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xD83E0EF0
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0xA416D2C5
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0xA016697F
character.
0x62221681

0x924EE0AB
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x52BA55C7
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x75B61742
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x0E6078DC
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0xB01BF2BC
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0xB5C6466D
of the occasion.
0x46ABD1BA

0x924EE0AB
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0xDBE65CAB
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x24FAD8F9
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x37B16F03
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xD8A46CA7
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x75627430
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x13506711
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x0639FB10
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x104DA787
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x5BB9B512
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xF9582116
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xF7953CEA
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x111751C0
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x2383426E
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x6D0D0265
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x10384EEA
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x97E31C8D

0x924EE0AB
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0x43E738FB
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x99AE1228
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x00F54BDC
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x94B4FDDD
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x089B1A2C
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x4BC0133B
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0xF354E000
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0xC6AF5700
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x5C5FE4F5
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x178BCC83
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0x111A86D7
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x02545C31
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xB3653BE7
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xBC4D437D
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x2F1DA551
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0xA1964558
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x1A6E71F9
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0xA0AED875
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xB8072D3D
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x566B2EE7
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x3272E235
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xF8B47754

0x924EE0AB
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0xE07B532F

0x924EE0AB
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x49EAC66E
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x1AAD790A
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x5C0B0EC6
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0xD7B9D25C
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x92EDF71F
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x86A3054C

0x924EE0AB
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x4F60883E
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0xB1DD44A5
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0xC5584B48
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x76D2F1BD
instantly revived.
0x41A48725

0x924EE0AB
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x294968BE
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0xA14E00F4
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x4877E799
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0x1F527CAE
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x1E112024
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x019DBB4A
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0x8972994E
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x953091D4
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0xA66BA395
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0x84F0D6F8

0x924EE0AB
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x5F67686C
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0x2E55B774
think_ again with all my might.
0x7AB31F17

0x924EE0AB
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x640EA75B
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0xB4B09D56
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0x29EDC892
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x99852AD6
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0xB5C4C56A
their resource?"
0x3A7521A5

0x924EE0AB
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x5870A01D
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x858C86D5
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0xB2386718
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xAB5ABCE1
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x4EF19A8C
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0x9B996251

0x924EE0AB
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x1F94DB48
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xD03A4094
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x6FB43DBF
_---shire Herald_."
0x66F1C3F8

0x924EE0AB
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x6A119C48

0x924EE0AB
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0xFE56234D

0x924EE0AB
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0xBDC91FC4
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0xAE0F7B44
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0x6C836035
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0x079EAB74
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0x8EAD89D9

0x924EE0AB
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x419FC75E
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x564AC3C3

0x924EE0AB
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x1C9438D0
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0xE9B027B7

0x924EE0AB
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x5D79466E
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x51977837
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0x1E4F53DA
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0x044629C0
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xF24E1B1C
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0x4F14344F
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0xBDD4C648
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0xA58E9D10
shire."
0x99D85552

0x924EE0AB
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0xCCB2A927
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x20EEE864
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x4C314A8A
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x68907152
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0x6A74CD2A
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x34FFD4A9
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0xBB67CA41

0x924EE0AB
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x59A011E8
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0xCF925AED
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x159C77BE
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x55BC182A
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xB211EB01
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0x730B095D
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0xF7BCF87D

0x924EE0AB
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0xF6C76628
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x66F8F016
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0xB6089F6D
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xAC1458D7
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0xF23854CC

0x924EE0AB
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0xA4634D5A

0x924EE0AB
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x54C5F032
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x586E8AFF
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x3951F9A7
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0xC07D96E8
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0x5857A07E

0x924EE0AB
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0x0517D78B

0x924EE0AB
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x4F1548DA
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0xEADC3BAB
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0x2AF3D2E1

0x924EE0AB
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x18D08919
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0xA763C420
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x27F0D713
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x6D7B836E
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x8E37C09A
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x6B6963C2
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x51C77392
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x9C1ED192
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0xFD591AFB
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x7959CB8A

0x924EE0AB
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x4E326519
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0x7E307095
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x12B550A4
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0xFF3DC864
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0xC1BCE55B
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0x0F4564B0
direction:--
0x505CDD57

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0xCD3D3417

0x924EE0AB
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0xC4BA2DF9
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x841AE13D
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x1C14BF80
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0xB39DC92D
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0xA70D7A38
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x5AAE2821
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xCF139BE0
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0xB2C555C8
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x6E8197B8
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0xE8D565C3
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x1E4B7096
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x2B14186F
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0xC056D95D
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x3FFE4143
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x335831E6
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0x07F76274
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xEE2DF214
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x67B92C11
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0x571A17AC
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x6856A5A2

0x924EE0AB
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0xBD9A40DE

0x924EE0AB
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0x22643667
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x7429AB48
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0xD34162CA
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xE6B04052
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x03350C14
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x81FD1927
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x764789AE
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x06696EDA
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x5302F2C6
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x2F1F003C
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0xC2706733
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0xCB0E2CA8
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0xC3C3F4E0
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x41A4437D
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0x396549A3
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x866256FE
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x5E1CDCAF
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0x40B51F8D
forthwith be furnished me.
0xB753FABA

0x924EE0AB
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0xC8DDBA8A
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x6374A190
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x8889118F
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0x50A6888A

0x924EE0AB
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0xEA64117C
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x25B21335
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x0455A54E
years ago from Gateshead.
0xB04D186E

0x924EE0AB
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x0C0395FB
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0xB3AB0C67
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x454C6B63
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x1B78124E
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x2D905E20
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x449CCEF5
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x8C0DD128
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0x650A1154
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x75AE202F
while the change was being accomplished.
0xED84B7D5

0x924EE0AB
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x83FBAAFA
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0x0C209374

0x924EE0AB
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xC7F937AC
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0xDB137C5C
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0xD014F2B7

0x924EE0AB
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x8A593021
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0xE07B4A38

0x924EE0AB
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0xA92BC162
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0xDBC5D465
complexion.
0xC54CF0DF

0x924EE0AB
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0xDA5FB051
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x82A58BE6

0x924EE0AB
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x24C3B507
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x387E6807
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x19D15504
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x70B47489

0x924EE0AB
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x27542BB8

0x924EE0AB
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0xA2FFF3A8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x17DA2649
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x61BA2C66

0x924EE0AB
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x48D4B71C

0x924EE0AB
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0xE805BF0E

0x924EE0AB
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x431B9EEE
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x4E8F57E2
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0xEF6A8D9D

0x924EE0AB
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0x09A17869
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0xB2161111
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0x3CAF69BF
would make two of you in breadth."
0xB173F1A1

0x924EE0AB
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xB4447A78

0x924EE0AB
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0xEC68DB41
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0x8E8B6520
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0x55F4EA8B
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x8F14F068
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x31DF0D9F
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0x50EBEBCA
quarrelling--"
0xB348C487

0x924EE0AB
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x9F981EB5

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xC17D7F34
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x687D394C
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0xF401336C
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0xB5D1CC2B

0x924EE0AB
"What does he look like?"
0x7B048C1D

0x924EE0AB
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x4C84A128
has such thick lips."
0x7176DA1F

0x924EE0AB
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x26FEBE6F

0x924EE0AB
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0xD705A81F
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x035792CD
a deal of money."
0x893BD638

0x924EE0AB
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x2A8CAFEB

0x924EE0AB
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0xEF4E0298
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0xB70B8451
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x17095CE3
you were quite out of my reach."
0x220FAB81

0x924EE0AB
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0xEE52B1EB
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xA74A7DA0
shape denote admiration.
0x7576D1CD

0x924EE0AB
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x2E234254
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x5DB24B6E
a child."
0xBAF91DA3

0x924EE0AB
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x76459527
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x7E5C58D1
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x6372C2C4
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x06FB47CF

0x924EE0AB
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0xC637EFAB
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x4D301DAA

0x924EE0AB
"A little."
0xD249EBE6

0x924EE0AB
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0x0F5EC097
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x9FEC8A7B
charmed.
0xAD726322

0x924EE0AB
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0xE2E8D72C
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0x98C219F7

0x924EE0AB
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xFD055470
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0x029F94E1
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0xCCBFA2B7
and which she had framed and glazed.
0x1D2EFA1B

0x924EE0AB
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0xD37F59CE
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x484EEC17
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x43E68908

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x52BDB590

0x924EE0AB
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0xD0BF5455

0x924EE0AB
"I can."
0x0A771268

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0x862F8841
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x3280BDDE
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0x4F2B592A
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x359EFB63

0x924EE0AB
"Never in my life."
0x48405C60

0x924EE0AB
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x58422D8F
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x3A729A30
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x1ADCAEAA
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0x29A7DEA1
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0xC78B315A
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0x962FCDDA
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0xDEAF0E04
father's brother."
0x92DC2910

0x924EE0AB
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x13D3E257

0x924EE0AB
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x83327F7C
tell me--"
0x84C06818

0x924EE0AB
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0x9FFF0693

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xB9F55746

0x924EE0AB
"So he went?"
0x211DC79D

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x4BAFA47F
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x13678C84
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0x920AF8E4

0x924EE0AB
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x492814FC
wine-merchant."
0x0292FB71

0x924EE0AB
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0xFDE7A959
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0x974153F1
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x23366B77
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0x1214F5E4
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x45D0BE71
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x844CDE8A
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x0A923D90

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XI
0xCE2799DA

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x17A79B08
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0xCD22BA25
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x2D7F8C8C
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x30D0CCC4
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x9CBF5F8B
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x5D57F3CF
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0xCBF57B36
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xA10645BA
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xA4286E7E
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0xCD5D12B9
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0x5F706D7F
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x2AB2FDF5

0x924EE0AB
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xE4EE6513
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x0A2A81EB
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x775C89ED
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x66972FAC
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0xBF8B6E3E
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x44C58451
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0x171B568C
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x1A756012
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0xC795F9D0
troubling my thoughts.
0x8BA62915

0x924EE0AB
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x2F969AFA
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x797B253A
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x8D69D9D9
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x154834B9
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x1A2B101E
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x59375B27
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x6644ABEF
the bell.
0x8DBE401A

0x924EE0AB
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0xE216F653
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x95804D5B

0x924EE0AB
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x0A4AB957
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x203BC9EF

0x924EE0AB
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x9742804D

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Person here waiting for you."
0x54EA80D3

0x924EE0AB
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x3455283B
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0x206D4824
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x150E5575

0x924EE0AB
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x8F013222
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x397B1D74

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0xFCB95533
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0x77FB0867
Thornfield.
0x38A43756

0x924EE0AB
"A matter of six miles."
0x64B11B22

0x924EE0AB
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0xF32B19E7

0x924EE0AB
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x25C44D27

0x924EE0AB
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x5613300A
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0xD8A3048E
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0x70E22DD5
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0xA7E2DFD3
much at my ease.
0x7FF2A01A

0x924EE0AB
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0xB8CA49A5
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0x1AED1EA5
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0xCF09DAC6
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x423D2D92
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xEB36639D
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0x4CFCC5DF
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x8AD9B06F
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0xCCDBBC55
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x55B5D648
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x7A3B6614
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0xED301831
road now, I wonder?"
0x4791AB05

0x924EE0AB
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0xC7EC2FF5
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x5260F1D5
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0xA1D8AE37
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0xD7A14D7B
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x6365D29A
more stirring, less romantic.
0x34B61405

0x924EE0AB
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x5EEE5C18
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0xBD4739FD
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0xF83328D3

0x924EE0AB
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0xB69FF363

0x924EE0AB
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x543C4C86
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x82B35B1C
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x304AA272
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x242A3290
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0xD5EDDF8B
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0xF2407DDE
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x10F47646
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x3876CCB7

0x924EE0AB
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0xA968B5F2
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0xD8D6780E
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0xBDDB0F4F
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0xE96970CD
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x43597A15
itself to my view.
0x25C5D227

0x924EE0AB
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x424C4090
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x50EB2859
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0x391C5B32
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x9E8ADEF9
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x54E7466A
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x85582A8E
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x88EDC71C
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xE6DE4244
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x563CA6A1
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x150105AC

0x924EE0AB
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0x3E418E08
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x58F2528E

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x8930E6AC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xA6BB87B5

0x924EE0AB
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0x2093E8D0
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x2D4355F8
trouble.
0x804BC952

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x86A58910
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x72F86193
the keys of the storeroom."
0xD1D0C7BE

0x924EE0AB
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x6592C943
delivered them to the servant.
0x2E9C180F

0x924EE0AB
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0xA2D35EDD
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x2F6FF3D8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, ma'am."
0x3C1176BD

0x924EE0AB
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0x67F39E9D

0x924EE0AB
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0x6148D971
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0xD5691F7E
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x1ACC6703
too soon."
0x102DB50D

0x924EE0AB
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x3CCF576E
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x72427A07
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0xCF3F11F1
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0xDDC4DF18
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0xC81A9327
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x0BADF0F7
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0x3809F641

0x924EE0AB
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x934528A8
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0x097434A6

0x924EE0AB
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0x3FC6FB30
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x3BFCCD35

0x924EE0AB
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x0E776C1D

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0x2C4CC297
future pupil."
0x4DA7A326

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xB4490876

0x924EE0AB
"No,--I have no family."
0x20D5AF34

0x924EE0AB
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0xC11A3982
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x3FCCB477
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.

0x924EE0AB
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x79A4B792
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0x9F157488
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0xF9E6071F
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0xA5666DBC
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x08B74397
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0xC16580A2
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x800EBB9F
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0xE2B7E585
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0x3404B2A2
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x438D48A6
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x034FBD55
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0xC993C430
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xE2534246
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x37ECD3C8
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0x065C8690
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0xAC1AC14E
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x96318E33
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x436870A3
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0x44D72C4C

0x924EE0AB
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x84703A96
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x6CA3D922
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xEFF0BC89

0x924EE0AB
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x2302227C
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0x0C9A2363
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0x24F1CC14
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0xF2C27E86
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0xE984BBA4
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0xBFCA0B60
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0x1816896D

0x924EE0AB
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0xDA66EDBC
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x2C2EDDE0
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x2A3E286D
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0x75660FFD
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x11D596F0
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xAB1F5E04
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x1A754F60
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0xE48ED882
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x21C2CACD
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0xF299B606
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0xEEA85742

0x924EE0AB
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x5D04C362
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x6F9D5F8E
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xDFDAA1D8
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x3D21A420
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xDB62297B
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xEBE0C3D0
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0xF745598B
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0xF1957434
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0xD0413F44
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xA32075ED
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x4F84E7EA
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x31E8DFC2

0x924EE0AB
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x34EAE1B5
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x7732793F
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x91E76069
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0x178A6E40
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xA1D28FD6
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0x1CEDA984
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0x7E110522
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0x38115754
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x7FBF02D8
an indefinite future period.
0xB5F39765

0x924EE0AB
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0x4F693CE4
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0x623B5DF7
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0xE47E23E8
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0xC545089A
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x79C07538
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x7443D126
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xB3B0C0CD
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x45CAEAEF
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x26541231
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0xC11780C6
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x5A931754
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0xECF330EB
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0xFA4E14F0
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x14EC063C
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xD486EA24
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x058D5F32
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0xD0CF396E
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x795BE2F7
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x864F2B6C

0x924EE0AB
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xF53E7A0F
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0xE5F71BCB
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0xC3DBFE29
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0xEDD07C83
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0x407937E5
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0x87CAC23D
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0xC8EFD3F6
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x5CE5B889
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0xDE000712
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x4DC82C8D
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x2977F57B
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x420B91C3
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x35C26043
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x6F9BA892
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x2AE82965
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x4E6C356C
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x7DF05F59
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x20EDFF6E
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xEA31801B
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x178DE287
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xD6522569
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x87D19E37
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0xE415FB2F
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x514F3A90
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xAAB7ECD3
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x91A1A3E7
house and gates.
0xA36222D5

0x924EE0AB
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x316D0FCD
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x01DB8097
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x17108D87
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xD89CD74F
appeared at the door.
0x226ECF59

0x924EE0AB
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x7D885D4F
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x7B2346C4

0x924EE0AB
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x69E29AA8
much.
0x4909268B

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0xB72A4BA7
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xE03EAEA0
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0xA78D7FE4
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0xBD155B57

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0xF1DCF103

0x924EE0AB
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0xE2643449
was called Rochester?"
0x789B7A14

0x924EE0AB
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xDA5F5E3C
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x129ADA21
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x2570DC1D

0x924EE0AB
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x75B95DDB

0x924EE0AB
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0xAC87C165
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x50AE6DB1
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x33B46845
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0xA4A106A5
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x889243B4
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x88A0647C
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x91A955B7
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0xC5CE80FA
expect nothing more."
0x5DE95EBE

0x924EE0AB
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x49D60C3F

0x924EE0AB
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0xCFE3A6ED
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x47C7620A
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x4AB0A1E0
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0xF0896932
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xC6D3207C
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xA4DD425C
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x868F4F57
the better--my position was all the freer.
0xCD4B1AFA

0x924EE0AB
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x69B08233
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x6ED38286
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0x2CA82603
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x4C8B7F9B
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x3B0D262A

0x924EE0AB
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x8A36F4FF
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x81C0F42E
approached.
0x506AEF5F

0x924EE0AB
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0xFE551449
nurse; who answered--
0x4B1EADD4

0x924EE0AB
"Mais oui, certainement."
0xF2AA97B4

0x924EE0AB
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0x199BBB45

0x924EE0AB
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0xCA314B28
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xD59B0ED9
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0xA6E8F8A0
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x325A11BD
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0x3D4347BA

0x924EE0AB
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0xBF47F73E
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x15BDDEE3
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0xEE91E8A8
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x6BBAB11C
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0xE85343F8
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0xA1A7F4EB
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0xC61A688F
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x397E351A
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x4894D1A0
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0xC7496935
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0xF3F53F14
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x4F231534

0x924EE0AB
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x8BD41C29
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x158EB148
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0xC55C44A4
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x6CFB8D3C
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x23219EA1
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x7CE010E7
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x8258A5AB
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0xFFA7028F
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0xEE197C0E

0x924EE0AB
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0xA534A2B6

0x924EE0AB
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0xC20054AF
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0xBE8ED88A
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0x5FDBA573
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0x187C7A4C
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0x55A99018
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xB21E0D51
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x7BA6B7CE
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x7FF9944C
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0xA19B91B3
fed with crumbs."
0xA236067B

0x924EE0AB
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x1C118F16

0x924EE0AB
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x2850E924
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x143D02BA

0x924EE0AB
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x00F2B2D2
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x41102414

0x924EE0AB
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x9B7FDD11
clean town you spoke of?"
0x53A615E4

0x924EE0AB
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xDEDDAFF3
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x9D5FB6AF
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x154A2D6C
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0x886BF63B
hear me sing now?"
0xA477C63D

0x924EE0AB
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x03F5D504
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x95938DBD
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x152F9787
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0xC5F4239D
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x0D9BA63B
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0xC011933B
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x5C5DFAE6
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0xD98365AD
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0xF44F3800
affected her.
0xC36A7AAC

0x924EE0AB
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x9F70B3CD
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x524CDE77
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x797A5C29
at least I thought so.
0x46726EB8

0x924EE0AB
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0xA25867C4
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x5CFE9FD7
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x85DCFF00

0x924EE0AB
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0xE488452E
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0x82F27907
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x0015F9A2
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x5B6B50DD
carefully trained.
0x25E13719

0x924EE0AB
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x7FECBBAE

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0xA7FDA95F
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x60837098
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xE9F5D128

0x924EE0AB
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x66ED2C7C
say, with whom did you live then?"
0x692E852F

0x924EE0AB
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xDA96FC9A
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x96E5DD31
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0xB2B38FAB
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x9483FCD9
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x12B9415A
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0xCAE33AF4
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x5D7AAAEA
and I never see him."
0x05C5C325

0x924EE0AB
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xBC37711E
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x98E2BEA4
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0xA618757A
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0xB5255E88
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0x9EDCC952
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0xDB266EC8
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x39430230
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x724182B1
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0xEA67DA40
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x949572E8
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x339F022F
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x70BABA3D

0x924EE0AB
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0xC7E4FFA2
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x87C21AB4
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x4D65B775
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0xBBDB9C36
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x2BD706F2
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x02310575
use.
0x4688C02E

0x924EE0AB
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x4C63F1F5
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xF95E326D
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0x78045E28
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0xECCADF7C
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0xE764A178
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x2500A2D4
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0xFC25E4E8
sideboard.
0x3CC6BF4D

0x924EE0AB
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x6E5FBE86
before seen any half so imposing.
0x9FAEB35F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x0E9772DD
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0xA655DB8B
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0xAF415258

0x924EE0AB
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0xC58D34A7
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x15DF81A9
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x3D7802CC
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0xA644A95B
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x0CC9E268
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x290E189B
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0x65D94EC3
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0x563C84BA
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0xB869A7D5
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0xA7A0FCE2
general blending of snow and fire.
0x481F9F4F

0x924EE0AB
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x52428B30
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x63DDEA81
were inhabited daily."
0xA0A76746

0x924EE0AB
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0xD06E6A65
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0x12098C9B
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x6AF55677
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0xD9B06596

0x924EE0AB
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0xF9E57A96

0x924EE0AB
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0x0DEE73D8
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x4084FEBB

0x924EE0AB
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0xE77296B1

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x873F22F0
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x50A4B10F
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x33DBD86F

0x924EE0AB
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xA81C6487
liked for himself?"
0x0DF0723A

0x924EE0AB
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x764A9DBD
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x2057A726
lived much amongst them."
0x986F43D0

0x924EE0AB
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x85755F15

0x924EE0AB
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x468D8E9D
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x95DD51DD
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x9EB2D6FA
conversation with him."
0x9B0B8E8C

0x924EE0AB
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0xD29BDA44

0x924EE0AB
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xCB1D7034
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x525B3CFC
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x227329AA
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x36BBD13F
he is a very good master."
0x0D9EBD91

0x924EE0AB
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0x390FE4F2
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x50369461
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0xBD23F209
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x9457161F
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x61954D3B
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0xD6475903
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x6EBD77C3
definite notion of his identity.
0x135D8734

0x924EE0AB
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0x67E5357F
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x43AD8D87
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0x302958DC
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x1D621385
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x75B662D1
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x19F82119
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x569EFF7B
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0xDD07E092
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0xD54BCCA9
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0xEC0A2CB4
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0xAD0F3A15
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0xFAA23E88
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0xB5D7B082
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0x5142D24B
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0x3272195C
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x1944DF13
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x4E73A3C7
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x01F92C51
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x6EB6B8A2
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x7704A0EF
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0xE519EC9C

0x924EE0AB
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x5559BA52

0x924EE0AB
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x8A4B989D
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0xC7857E59
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0xB8DEF025

0x924EE0AB
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x76023EA5

0x924EE0AB
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x215EDD6C

0x924EE0AB
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x6842F6E8

0x924EE0AB
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0xF9F359B4
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xB8A3DF0E
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xBAF3A9C3

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0xACC0B5B2
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x7F5083B9

0x924EE0AB
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x1E80D24B
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x2A9A1925
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x6135475E
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x71F4AEC8
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x9F9C313A
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x1260DAA1
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x73AD35FF
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x27229CDE
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0x66B36199
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x255C171E
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0xFBCE5564
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x0F08FCEB
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x578A4D8C
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0xBAE929C7
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x0CB116FC
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0xB8D5B8BE
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0x959B9F39

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x00D26CBF
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x4F7EF417
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0xDA729956
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x473A4A23
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x1CD0C3A6
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0xB82830FB
Bluebeard's castle.
0xFE5EEA8F

0x924EE0AB
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x6A1630FB
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x483DB126
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x3DDF6D8B
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0xBB38B005
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0xCFC36CC0
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x7F9A013E
out the door whence the accents issued.
0xF0AD4C2E

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0xAC6FD20B
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0xED9EC49C

0x924EE0AB
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0xF8240C7F

0x924EE0AB
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xF790F186

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x4583BEED
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0xDF5ECBF2

0x924EE0AB
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x64E8DBBD
odd murmur.
0xBB71F9B3

0x924EE0AB
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0xDC780CF0

0x924EE0AB
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0x5AB7B9F4
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x96F95032
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0xA15D2548
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0x9E042086
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xDC17EC0B
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x7F195DD5

0x924EE0AB
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0xA3A2BDDB
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x998405D6
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0x6672BAD4
be conceived.
0xA9819465

0x924EE0AB
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0x0FC3CA01
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xD9F83E91

0x924EE0AB
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x63C5161B
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x48C64AAE
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0x5A3809A4
pupil this morning?"
0x141D8D4D

0x924EE0AB
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0x3D46A81C
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x7A62DE46
hall, exclaiming--
0x90F3C98A

0x924EE0AB
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x79ACED80

0x924EE0AB
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
0x02A1C776

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XII
0x1D89E464

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x9F67227B
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x7A19E495
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x37846670
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x61F21F3F
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0x237ABA76
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0xEE8299A4
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0xF7BCB306
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x596174D6
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0xDA19040B
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x0F6C3E69
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xB04E1D9B
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0xB08769BF
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x2E38D1FE
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x166BD1BB
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x2D07E683
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x7D9A4D8F

0x924EE0AB
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x7D15F486
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x4AC366C0
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x654065E0
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x99CDD0C1
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xE243CCF6
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0xF6859FE4
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x8FF0DD24
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x57647632
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x14AB0720
of her mind and character.
0xF8ED14BB

0x924EE0AB
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0xDF797930
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0xDACC6983
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x8476AEAB
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x219C65EC
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xB63C051F
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x31FD7D97
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x1E9E9978
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0x9AD0E4EE
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x0086AC59
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0x9ED77A01
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x350DAFD8
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0xA974CDD4
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x50FE1A1A
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0x70A8D2CD

0x924EE0AB
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x51D9AC4F
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x56D28A5A
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0xFC5781F4
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0xB82F8829
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x6DE5802E
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x3FEDA388
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x24DD4092
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x2D603EDE
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x302E9ECE
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0xB628246B
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x276BD67A

0x924EE0AB
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x8E552A46
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0xA3C0D0B9
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0xF1E42448
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x20C4FAC5
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x3A0DE5A3
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x96E5DA9D
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x478328E2
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x35BD90E4
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xEE9D28B4
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0xB94005A4
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0xF22A15B6
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x7EF858BF
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0xA865CFD8
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x865A0E77

0x924EE0AB
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x44A1EE11
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0xEAF1CDE1
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x903B0DB3
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0xD495F807
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0x95BD7EE6
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x2D544322
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x1050CAB4
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0xC4614A99
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0xB7521986
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0xE9A4BC03
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x1375522D
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xC89BF83F
every effort of that sort.
0x93DC62C3

0x924EE0AB
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x78A1C63F
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0xD92656A4
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0xD999B59F
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x2D29DBF5
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xDC53FC85
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0xCB0B7CD5

0x924EE0AB
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x89D5D520
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x9F59CE9C
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x68909A27
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0xFCC11772
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x336EBF43
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0xDCC72B95
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x25D7E17C
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0xC3BE9949
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0xFF3A3DA4
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x336304CC
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0x3697385E
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x6A07D217
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0x8CC2525F
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0xB2E980EC
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0xDF76EA23

0x924EE0AB
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x43074972
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0x18156FEF
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x15E909D8
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x1706C4F9
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x0C9D2C54
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0xAE2161E3
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0x02667E6E
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xF3AAD2B4
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xB4B1FC1B
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x72F977A9
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0x45BB1D14
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x6E0606AE
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x7A9CC302
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x3778062F
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x0E335E88

0x924EE0AB
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0xFA39CC5E
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xE1D67E4C
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x292A8117
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x375277CD
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x81F80B81
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0xDA04D54D
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x8212B34D
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0xB825AA5F
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xB2E4F0E6
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0xB478E011

0x924EE0AB
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0x4E495354
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x57B8706F
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x0FCF5FB1
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0xD3493C97
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0xCD8795D5
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xD4EE13C9
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x96A10E11
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0xAD5F9384

0x924EE0AB
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x97A37B1F
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0x9CF7A00C
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x7DDB9A8B
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x728CC35C
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0x21CDB2C2
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x6A6A5C67

0x924EE0AB
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x9A1A1A16
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x767EFC62
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xC4159E7D
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x6C282423
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0x2787BC76
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x7E1FF505
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xC4E69751
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x6858101D
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xB9A64D7F
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0x3E35B336
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xE08FCCC8
me.
0x23A34F09

0x924EE0AB
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x079D6D30
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x80E24AE9
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x5A358799
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x6533B7A9
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x2C0EE5F0
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x073E771E
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x1A177131
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xF204842B
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x60974AF0
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0xA716FD9E
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x3F3A73C1
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0xB61A008E
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x55908CAD
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xD3807482
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x34861EE8
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x9725327E
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x4FD64BA4
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x84C79457
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0xC393484C
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0xB9A8068B
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x8EF8A914
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x46BFB074
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0xD6401C50

0x924EE0AB
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x28C53C37

0x924EE0AB
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0xFE491B47
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xCCADB127

0x924EE0AB
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x6458B2A6

0x924EE0AB
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0xFDE610DD
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0xC8D4D637
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xC2AE5221
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x1F363222
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x5D180683
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x7507BED0
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x43ECFE29
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x02BD1017
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0xEFF478A0

0x924EE0AB
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x2B8F616E
now drew near him again.
0xE8B07205

0x924EE0AB
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xD1B2E174
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0x41937642

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0x36CC1627
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0xD89958B3
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xC3716A2C

0x924EE0AB
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x5907284C
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xA33A579F
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0xDD772D0F
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x7169F026
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x84ED2204
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0xE54A412B
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x3AF86847
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x779A5106
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0xF9042962
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0xC9DBFDF1
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0xFBD8148B
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0xE2B3FC59
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x0E5F36CE
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x10CDA6E4
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x004A0460
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0x013BB779

0x924EE0AB
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x0382188B
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0x3064F236
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x56D33434
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0x780D3B52
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0xC812B0C3

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0x36C5D32D
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0xB0669AD5

0x924EE0AB
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x7E68F7C0
direction before.
0x33867FD8

0x924EE0AB
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0xECF0CCB9
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0xD354A05B

0x924EE0AB
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x8D84C755
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0xB1479123
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0xE70C31BD

0x924EE0AB
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x70BA8CF3
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x631D89CC
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x4DA8EF56
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0x1655A363

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Whose house is it?"
0x52900BDB

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x078DBA39

0x924EE0AB
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0xF6C2652A

0x924EE0AB
"No, I have never seen him."
0xB9115BD9

0x924EE0AB
"He is not resident, then?"
0x20302DEB

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x7F3C3679

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot."
0xBC80600E

0x924EE0AB
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0xEF25CF2D
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0xD2D81B00
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x2AC600D1
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0xE74642F7

0x924EE0AB
"I am the governess."
0xA66E293C

0x924EE0AB
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0xABBB170B
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x146D06E2
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0xB0F25C0B

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x1A02C18D
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0x82F31838

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0x3197A307

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0x49E1D1B8
afraid?"
0x0B3ECB6A

0x924EE0AB
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x119CBD19
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0xA9981588
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0x669AFE55
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0xA23E52E9
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0xEA56CC6D
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0x3E6DF9C4
he laughed.
0x7C8767B3

0x924EE0AB
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0xE44257C2

0x924EE0AB
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xA6C60C5F
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x04E9F5A3
come here."
0xAFE6E499

0x924EE0AB
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0xF1F24D7B
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xD7BAE58C
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x0565BF47
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0xD0552034
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x5DA919EE

0x924EE0AB
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0xE458FEA7
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x5C194590

0x924EE0AB
I sought it and found it.
0x70EB2FDB

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0x51E7C461
you can."
0x6F5A8234

0x924EE0AB
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0xC56FB904
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0x7856CE79

0x924EE0AB
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x1490950B
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xB0CF7AA2

0x924EE0AB
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x19C7F60C
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x905FAAA0
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x8B2DFDB7
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xBBFCCEA7
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xEA910441
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x03FF3A09
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0x58DC8373
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x09D10482
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x3B6233F4
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0xB53DF0F4
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x39340F4B
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x5ACE3E3A
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x5AE8E44F
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x3CD60C0A
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x6C493FBF
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0xF9252E42
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x8BBCC0FF
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x56CECF36
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xC077C67B
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xD7A76F89

0x924EE0AB
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x388F542D
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0x82D14666
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0x03818C73
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x430DE9F0
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x8F39E1A6
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0xF92BB61E
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0x17778561
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x1DCA2F1B
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0xC46A15F1
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x26267A2A
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x11CF3566
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x9F52584A
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0xC5762DF1
as it would be under his.
0xBFE60DD7

0x924EE0AB
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0x7CDDF69C
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0xA5B1877D
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0xCB8D4DFB
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0xF6E59E90
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x0AC4C2E2
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0xD5E6D2A7
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x90E526F8
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0x3B131F6B
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0x7332A88F
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0x3543D772
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x8B467EDC
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0x0066FC80
door, and went in.
0x1AA7D12F

0x924EE0AB
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0xC82ED239
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0x4AE2BCC4
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0xC07B6D94
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0xADB0F621
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x724D6C96
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0xE37B986C
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x504CF0BA
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x8EA6D026
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x959A5E81

0x924EE0AB
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x24431F6E
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x8AD30243
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0xFDA53980
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0x0311795B
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x239177D1
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x22631770
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0xABB01526
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x4A135932
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0xC0FC9AC6

0x924EE0AB
"What dog is this?"
0x9FA0E0DE

0x924EE0AB
"He came with master."
0x39489DE0

0x924EE0AB
"With whom?"
0x5FDAE3F7

0x924EE0AB
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x9B35A18B

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0x96D98A66

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x336EA35F
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0xDF48A3D7
sprained."
0x191F4B10

0x924EE0AB
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x9CE4BFFB

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x4AB89C0F

0x924EE0AB
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0xE7A1937A

0x924EE0AB
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0xFB0FA2A7
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x3D8B876A
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0xE8521903
upstairs to take off my things.
0x0AE2742C

CHAPTER XIII
0xFDCF84FC

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x4E6C0D20
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x27001F59
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xE938DBF5
and waiting to speak with him.
0xE09CE093

0x924EE0AB
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x518E9534
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x4AF5B012
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xAE6FD239
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x87EB13EF
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0xE5AB3FBA
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x16B79406
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0xBE562F52
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x41C672FB
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x5861FCD5

0x924EE0AB
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x02CD315C
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0xD5C77A7F
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x3B922B7A
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0xC21E6496
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0x3B817C0D
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0xC5AF581B
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x3B9CF86A
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x5FC1470F
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x73853CB0
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x12E551C5
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x8C45D766

0x924EE0AB
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x59A72256
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x30282BF9
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x453F6F2D
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x28733C86
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x2E545CC1

0x924EE0AB
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0x589FA7AA
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0xB2F0C022
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x27BD7BD2
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x64123FE2
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0xF831400D
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0xFF02E29F
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0x79A11A66
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0x91F246AB
fireside.
0xB0A0CA0A

0x924EE0AB
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x42845925
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x4589AC2F
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x584992ED
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0x6B4A0D74
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x4F1B94AD

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0xCDA961A4
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0xC971D106
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0xC92C9E10

0x924EE0AB
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0x2C98E917

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x5323BC04
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x84811E35
candle."
0x0FD8ABB0

0x924EE0AB
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0xDA6F3D98

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0xE5CACC1E
is here."
0x1F8F9125

0x924EE0AB
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0x8854A616
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0x72554C08
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x30C47FD2
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0xEE3E5522
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0xBAA5E86B

0x924EE0AB
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x50BAF3AD
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0x97E5BCB4
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x8B9DAFEE
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xA065500D
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0xD3191513
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0xFD52B959
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x3C0E370C

0x924EE0AB
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x56F6C746
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0xD1F9C7AF
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x2F3A47CB
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0xFA6009BA
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x3F1308E9
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0xDD00E7F9
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x25549AC5
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x49B0F3C5
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0xC13614CE
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0xBBB0F812
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x54FDBC03
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x398346A3
neither tall nor graceful.
0xB8EB05F6

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x8DCEFB3B
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0xDD863EC2
lifted his head as we approached.
0x02C790D5

0x924EE0AB
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0x24FF8BF6
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0x7926EA1C

0x924EE0AB
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x776CA4CB
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x468B38E1
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x0C9DC701
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0x8F8087B6

0x924EE0AB
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x85221016
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x19DC50C1
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x2535D27C
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x5A5C7567
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0x32F1FCE9
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x177368D9

0x924EE0AB
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xB77EBBB6
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x5A9669DD
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0xDE245BF1
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x32C75F87
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0xE1F1F6F6
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x3933BD49

0x924EE0AB
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0xD4F133DC
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x3F80A5E6
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x1F11680A
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0x8F4BBB6D

0x924EE0AB
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x0D2A7CED
might perhaps spill it."
0x4F6EF7A4

0x924EE0AB
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x88E47761
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0xDA2B2FD8

0x924EE0AB
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0xA25ED66E
votre petit coffre?"
0xFE898C3B

0x924EE0AB
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0xACD16605
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x442E4D09
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0xC321DB72

0x924EE0AB
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0xF46DEEAB
thought pleasant things."
0xA8A9B6A7

0x924EE0AB
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x8A138D6A

0x924EE0AB
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x00407A89
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x933C727D
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xBDB2549F
nature."
0x3774474C

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0xD6E699B3
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x3BC421DF

0x924EE0AB
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x7BBCC581
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x3A9B3767
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x131A311A
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0xC9BC450F
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x6A556E42

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x27CAC329
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0x8437F87A
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0x0C49C176

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0xED10EF84
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x96CB2AD5

0x924EE0AB
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x6D0712B8

0x924EE0AB
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0xB117E5A7
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x2F15C0F5
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x87441499
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xFA0CCFEA
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x945F8633
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x67A066A3

0x924EE0AB
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0x10E90436

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And you came from--?"
0xAD304AE4

0x924EE0AB
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0x6CF15C14

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x245D6F9D

0x924EE0AB
"Eight years."
0x8CB7EB35

0x924EE0AB
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0xA6A09DBD
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x034AE563
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0x73E95BC7
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0xA3A31B9A
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x337C1D60
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xC448BE89

0x924EE0AB
"I have none."
0x43DE49B6

0x924EE0AB
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x75E67E1A

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0x17AC8EB4
that stile?"
0x094F09F4

0x924EE0AB
"For whom, sir?"
0xB5551522

0x924EE0AB
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x62F6645E
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0x166AB239
causeway?"
0xA7D1B427

0x924EE0AB
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xF8B7EF7E
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0xFF9B093D
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x649C4E78
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x89A951B2
revels more."
0x76985B33

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xDA7FE547
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x560BE4DB

0x924EE0AB
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x029E8850
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x17210CA7

0x924EE0AB
"No; none that I ever saw."
0xF1388CC2

0x924EE0AB
"And your home?"
0xE9E25094

0x924EE0AB
"I have none."
0x43DE49B6

0x924EE0AB
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x5DC569BC

0x924EE0AB
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0x7DA1E6E4

0x924EE0AB
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0xB9772800

0x924EE0AB
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0x70E7DD4F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x66922FAE
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x849398BB
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x59A4F5E4
Adele."
0x9C95B49C

0x924EE0AB
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0xBE856A09
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x97CAF60C
felling my horse."
0xB50E962D

0x924EE0AB
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x3162D85F

0x924EE0AB
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0xBCCB6114

0x924EE0AB
The widow looked bewildered.
0x82CADE8D

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x00C152AA

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir."
0x93403769

0x924EE0AB
"Have you seen much society?"
0x01E3AFDA

0x924EE0AB
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0xF50C56B5
Thornfield."
0x02CB8204

0x924EE0AB
"Have you read much?"
0xD78EE7CB

0x924EE0AB
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0xB427250A
very learned."
0x128F1A3C

0x924EE0AB
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x78F5C42A
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0x7AA4BA20
parson, is he not?"
0xB1DB60CF

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0x15F8A97C
would worship their director."
0xD32AA94A

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, no."
0xA774BA75

0x924EE0AB
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0xAB310EA8
sounds blasphemous."
0xC3964469

0x924EE0AB
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x5BB0351C
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x5582AEBB
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0xC64530F8
hardly sew."
0x54E47145

0x924EE0AB
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x49D336ED
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0x4F65BE07

0x924EE0AB
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0x5C3FF39E
Rochester.
0x0149FAEC

0x924EE0AB
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0xE2406C1A
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x182B4CC7
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x96D54951
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0x0CBF0972
to bed."
0x50ED3D59

0x924EE0AB
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x5F70D01F

0x924EE0AB
"About ten."
0x05F3CE7F

0x924EE0AB
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0xE77D171D

0x924EE0AB
I assented.
0xA341BFBE

0x924EE0AB
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0xDA17BDE1
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x3777F32C
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0x2951B73D
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0xF6A331E3

0x924EE0AB
"A little."
0xD249EBE6

0x924EE0AB
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0x27635A17
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x4AED67F4
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xB1806793
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x55F31326
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xE3EA092B

0x924EE0AB
I departed, obeying his directions.
0x8CAF846D

0x924EE0AB
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0xD362915E
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xF9BEB53D
not well."
0x0CC1B98F

0x924EE0AB
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x657B64E6
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x4C5BF01F
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0xA36CD930

0x924EE0AB
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x2D182464

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0xD382B567
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x31B815D9
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0xEA9B7225

0x924EE0AB
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0x380A86CD

0x924EE0AB
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0xF6C9CC31

0x924EE0AB
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x39C66EC2
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0xDE37C58A

0x924EE0AB
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0x67880350
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x7906CF77

0x924EE0AB
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x832E567F
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x3A9129FB

0x924EE0AB
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0x78F25A73
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x87C987C7
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x660332A1
hand yours?"
0x0C114A9A

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x36D48AFA
some thought."
0x1E11B26C

0x924EE0AB
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0x4AC59ACE
other occupation."
0xE7931B2A

0x924EE0AB
"Where did you get your copies?"
0xB864178E

0x924EE0AB
"Out of my head."
0xB0B9A120

0x924EE0AB
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0xD3B1347B

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0xABA2AD79

0x924EE0AB
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0xDB66AE49

0x924EE0AB
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0x79EA3EDC

0x924EE0AB
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0x1DF2047E
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xB7CDE71C
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xF7795889
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x7B374080
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0xE75160CB
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0xDE1E55AF

0x924EE0AB
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0xA03EDE3C
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x52FF6879
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0x7BD3BC64
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0xB4D4ACD3
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x56A12C69
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xE187FC26
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x4ACAFC35
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0xE7686194
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0xAECFC4E7
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x0B5CC32E

0x924EE0AB
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0xE7DAC005
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x62213F69
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0x0D652DF8
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x1A2CEAF9
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x4CB52091
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0xEFBA2C8B
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0xC0E9BA34
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x74AACB9B
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0xA221A9FD
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0x1F5540FD

0x924EE0AB
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x4D841765
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x7778AC06
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x0C493EFC
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0x54AFFD7C
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0x16E654F8
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0xFA96D5E0
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x36296934
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x0C62B50F
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x965A8186
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x391F804A
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x8C80B542
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xA7A9447B

0x924EE0AB
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x3F4C5AF8
presently.
0x7660899B

0x924EE0AB
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x701893F2
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0xB4F13BDB

0x924EE0AB
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x17D7662D
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x515E8269
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0xD9D8FB50
each day?"
0xCD0D746B

0x924EE0AB
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x1B2B57FF
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x3A572F92
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0xDDCA6102

0x924EE0AB
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0xCD5F6EBE

0x924EE0AB
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x7E0B410D
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x0FA072B0
powerless to realise."
0x4429BD67

0x924EE0AB
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0xEF75337B
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0xE44625B4
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x3C0F45DC
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x29D39AF7
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0xE29F0923
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x1F0A0572
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0xA14BB30F
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0x9B72FA72
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x0376A40B

0x924EE0AB
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x69C1D9FC
watch, he said abruptly--
0x936D8899

0x924EE0AB
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x05B89C0D
so long?  Take her to bed."
0xDF1D0B43

0x924EE0AB
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x84B7859D
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0xF94B58F9
much.
0x4909268B

0x924EE0AB
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x9AFF2A65
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0xA07E764C
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x40350636
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0xCBA48C60

0x924EE0AB
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x0CE7D8FE
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0xE717C8E8

0x924EE0AB
"Well, is he?"
0x9D8AF3A5

0x924EE0AB
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x28DE15E8

0x924EE0AB
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xB9ECAAFB
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xAC03E0F6
temper, allowance should be made."
0x84B0167D

0x924EE0AB
"Why?"
0x1DD0B2F4

0x924EE0AB
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0xC3E34AEF
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0x73B83DE2
make his spirits unequal."
0x61F8F455

0x924EE0AB
"What about?"
0x1D181B22

0x924EE0AB
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0x13C3893A

0x924EE0AB
"But he has no family."
0x166202E3

0x924EE0AB
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x92DCFC4C
brother a few years since."
0x3E7DD117

0x924EE0AB
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x1D3CFD0D

0x924EE0AB
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x746BF388
the property; only about nine years."
0x63976036

0x924EE0AB
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xCABE8288
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0xD2EBD6BB

0x924EE0AB
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0xBE594B91
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0xD20B7BF9
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x2F8CF47C
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x524228DF
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x8B4A8167
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0xCCC645A9
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0xBA594316
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x89AD0FA9
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0x7BCAED5B
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x9448CEAE
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0x4AE7DD17
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x400D876F
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x5F8D317A
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0xAD65D6E2
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0xE29FA165
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0xA79714F0

0x924EE0AB
"Why should he shun it?"
0x03B47A4B

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x79692EE2

0x924EE0AB
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0xB6083000
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xD0C8BC04
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x35862357
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x6BFA1A7B
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0xAB94B0CF
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x4F735F7F

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XIV
0xD2D7CB78

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0x73BF86CE
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0xED852AC2
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xE05BE629
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x53F01138
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0xC9357A2D
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x1AF56EE3

0x924EE0AB
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x62396F35
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0xA3E1A3C7
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x596CF3C4
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x86746122
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x158C4E7E
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xC367C484
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x265D7903
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x3F137659

0x924EE0AB
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x74434599
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x72565BA3
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0x381FB8CA
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0xB8DB1F6D
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0x8DD6016A
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xEB3E3313
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0xF935545B
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0xFE8247D3
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x5301B22B
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0x082F86A2
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0xBD2753ED
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x0302B5BF
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0xA003ED07

0x924EE0AB
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x7C34860D

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0xCB4CCC23
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x9135EA88
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x01BD334A
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x266CB50C
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x44705390
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x3FA2ED5E
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x98320930

0x924EE0AB
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x656F9055
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x232E1399
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xAA49654E
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x2744B602

0x924EE0AB
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0x8EB2E68D
contemplation.
0x79CAB7F9

0x924EE0AB
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0xA95B9440
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0xD45979C9

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x5C6A2EF8
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x4FADA3EA
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xDDA53B45
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x5712AA93
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x41C5D3BB
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0xC381610F
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x91170C6E
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x7C7EF33B
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0xB7AF5218
said to be thicker than water."
0x3B5B2FC3

0x924EE0AB
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x369438B2
knitting-basket in hand.
0xFEFE9A37

0x924EE0AB
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0xFEB20301
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0xADDFE2E8
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xBE3B8607
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0x48C6034A
performed."
0xF83C9F5E

0x924EE0AB
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x982A7739
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x10D9F2F6
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x7F330F52
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x925044BB

0x924EE0AB
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0xF79020AC
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x09A1F148
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0xAE0C7CE1
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x637A37BE
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xF3C20AAA
mind to do."
0xCFC2F292

0x924EE0AB
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x7671F0DE
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xF0CD1D74
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x976BC60E

0x924EE0AB
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xE61E147A
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0xDC3B6786
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x09C15FAF
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0xF4EE4D67
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0xF5AEC559
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0x3D2C2EB1

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0xEA59F8C2
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x75BE2C64
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x06804BF6
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0xD1F59BEE
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x7463AA5A
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x90CA2FA6
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0x1BA37DB9
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0x240C80F0
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x4E69DCD0
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x6279B09F
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x66083F5E
feeling.
0x1522B65B

0x924EE0AB
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0xEEC46642
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x569AE2F6
fastened on his physiognomy.
0xB7B25148

0x924EE0AB
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0xEE24D584

0x924EE0AB
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0xB580FFCA
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x8C2B4EA5
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0xD7934532

0x924EE0AB
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x19508A98
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x012A2E08
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0xE51DA116
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x525799A1
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x6DCD04D7
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0xEB3C7E6B
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xE394DC78

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x8D2F83FB
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0xAF8BC520
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xF8A45D36
consequence, or something of that sort."
0x90883B56

0x924EE0AB
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0xC0F11DB5
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x668917B1
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x205FFB9F
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x6C965E85
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0x6DC552C6

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xA77B443B
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x1FC27C5C

0x924EE0AB
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x02591D84
does my forehead not please you?"
0x7A2FB1A9

0x924EE0AB
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x0EEDAABF
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0xB064F91B
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0xE0344555

0x924EE0AB
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0xE27EE68B

0x924EE0AB
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x1000ACF3
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x9EDBCF01

0x924EE0AB
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x5910CCB8
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0xBEA21AA7
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x79D1475A
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x9C51A84E
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xA988F675
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x63417437
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0x4ACDD4A9
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x4F8A4053
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x56D38DF4
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x8F8C2D51
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x1D10A1F4
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0xDDFF3728
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x2D7B870B
me?"
0x7C187227

0x924EE0AB
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x647D8F96

0x924EE0AB
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0xAF7E423E

0x924EE0AB
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x1EFC9284
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x103128A1
capable of being re-transformed?
0x3B1015A4

0x924EE0AB
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x8476D9B0
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x9A6BD281
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0x009434E0
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0xBE96EC47
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0xDCEEC25B
to-night."
0xD7B56391

0x924EE0AB
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x6E20A405
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x123393AC
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x155AC7CD
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x447625B5
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x8FABFD61
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x590B30A9
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x5D87B578
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x210B6B18
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x66526504
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x0E923EF7
confidence.
0x2C98D37A

0x924EE0AB
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x5890AB29
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x42A6D106
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xA908BF57
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0xD66719F5
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x3808828C
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0xF1BC6351
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x31D2DC5B
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x0F095B66
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0x7A97545B
you--therefore speak."
0xE7F67C6D

0x924EE0AB
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x92896131
smile either.
0x8BF62365

0x924EE0AB
"Speak," he urged.
0x3DD5E0D7

0x924EE0AB
"What about, sir?"
0x373D9935

0x924EE0AB
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xE0EAFD2F
treating it entirely to yourself."
0xC31F7569

0x924EE0AB
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x5C3A6F95
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0x3C455605
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0x769B89BE

0x924EE0AB
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xFAC8DD86

0x924EE0AB
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xF9F41B34
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x248439A1

0x924EE0AB
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xA6FBCE82
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0xB53125C8
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x13664C27
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xDA15EB02
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x3A4DC1F2
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0x1944FD88
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x0DED7C4C
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0x7335BA6B
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x3693D0D1
rusty nail."
0xB425B55C

0x924EE0AB
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x1315DB4F
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0xDF37B5D8

0x924EE0AB
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x06E2C921
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x1CB4E716
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x62EC737E

0x924EE0AB
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0xCC0D69E0
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0xE1B32BB4
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x03300AEB
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0xBCE942D6
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x9ECE5638
people in one house?"
0xB8230A08

0x924EE0AB
"Do as you please, sir."
0xFC5497A1

0x924EE0AB
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x96D11056
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x2EAF0262

0x924EE0AB
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0x92336BCD
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x21AC1D92
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x990680FD
and experience."
0x69022126

0x924EE0AB
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x0CEFA335
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x9AAA81B3
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x9FF6F41A
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0xE48EBDB3
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0x0F4CF11A

0x924EE0AB
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xE7DF463A
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0x9E4F7469

0x924EE0AB
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0x784816C4
expression; "but speak too."
0x68AF6487

0x924EE0AB
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x2B57DD9E
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0x3AC98248
their orders."
0x037AAAC3

0x924EE0AB
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xEBF014A9
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0xCB00F13F
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x919754B2

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x96B89BAA
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0x4057B79A
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x39B52212

0x924EE0AB
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0x0B9868DF
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0x04244F1B

0x924EE0AB
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0x6A896711
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x6DC0D4EE
salary."
0xD0777A09

0x924EE0AB
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x80B8011C
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x34B8282D
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x2C0927FD
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0xD8DF628B
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0xB58EF909
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0xED1F3721
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x471CAFCC
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xAD7C3EDB
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x1066CBB4
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x9E259D50
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x633E7094
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x32C6B7D1
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0xF4812272
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0x594F7669

0x924EE0AB
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0xDFE01676
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x4AE858F7
as well as imagined--
0x0C9FEA83

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x8B94AB54
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x053167B4
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0x4A508FD7
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x0B6575FC
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xB9A72CD3
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x2B596377
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x82648691
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0xE6920C4C
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x4B5F3774
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x33D0B631
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0xB5C774D4
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x4F599A6F
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x59AF41DF

0x924EE0AB
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x45B24239

0x924EE0AB
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x5412837C
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x290E1F08
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x77C7977D
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x9F2AA338
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xB75AEAD6
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0xF72E6C02
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0xC1D53412
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0x38A04E25
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x6D512615
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0x314C851A
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x45F3F773
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xDDF07695
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x9596A3DE
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0xE9A0B2DF
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x210C0065
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0xF9185BD6
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0xC9192F13
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0xE496A396

0x924EE0AB
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0x15ECB103

0x924EE0AB
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0xEFBFCE8B
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x71649C46
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0xF6B0C4EF
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x076E4AC3
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0xF5B21C3E
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x8A1A49D8
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0x33F6DE87
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0x80FA342C
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x839277E2

0x924EE0AB
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x9EB8DE9E

0x924EE0AB
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0xD5A5EEF7
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0xD3C9EB46
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0x8134528C
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0xE0FE35B1
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0x4877C4D2

0x924EE0AB
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0x9BC8167B

0x924EE0AB
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0xE4B98760
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0x17F95218
moor."
0x25AB1C39

0x924EE0AB
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0xCC8D2471

0x924EE0AB
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0xF87E12F5
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0x1BAEE9E5
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x032FCF99
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0x7D661F01
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0x455BE9AE

0x924EE0AB
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0xA0511250
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0xADA49090

0x924EE0AB
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x9995FF5B
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0xAA23540F
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x5F26BC76
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0x1CE2971C
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0xBA05F8DC
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0x8920A8EE

0x924EE0AB
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0xDC5F5E7F

0x924EE0AB
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0x1F574072
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0x3D8CBEF1
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0x73E8D4F4

0x924EE0AB
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0x4519A32D
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0xDEE11D42
misery if you listen to it."
0x1184FE27

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0x1C7CE3CB
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0xDA416567
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0x38C61665

0x924EE0AB
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x2E5D7573
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0x6B580C2C
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0x18BC4988

0x924EE0AB
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0x6DD5C116
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0x7EC560F2
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x9F2F5C5D

0x924EE0AB
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0x1869C355
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0x8F8A8A6B
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0x19575617
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0x9469F228
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0x1F630965
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0xC9E4A649
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0x9B59809C
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0xD212D90D
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0x8AD59E92
which you might revert with pleasure."
0x938C6C4E

0x924EE0AB
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0x6D378BDC
paving hell with energy."
0x0A4EE158

0x924EE0AB
"Sir?"
0xF1D868FC

0x924EE0AB
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0x89D5583F
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0x10A5416B
been."
0xB02BF93D

0x924EE0AB
"And better?"
0x4653B4F8

0x924EE0AB
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0xC48BD910
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0xCD57FB4E
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0x70674E89
and Persians, that both are right."
0x777A5278

0x924EE0AB
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0xB0AA8C3E

0x924EE0AB
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0xE3B7C870
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0x91B49D9A

0x924EE0AB
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0x21A52018
is liable to abuse."
0x81B244CB

0x924EE0AB
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0xD7092530
abuse it."
0x1D79517B

0x924EE0AB
"You are human and fallible."
0xB45EAA41

0x924EE0AB
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0x1ADF09FE

0x924EE0AB
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0x87F8829D
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xACA9AC49

0x924EE0AB
"What power?"
0x94AE001F

0x924EE0AB
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x33560142
right.'"
0x55C650FE

0x924EE0AB
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0x0251D683

0x924EE0AB
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0x342CBE3F
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0xA93C8FB0
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0xD93DAA34
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0xEDEA80EC
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0x51521B4A

0x924EE0AB
"Where are you going?"
0xD6BEBB8A

0x924EE0AB
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0x782CFE59

0x924EE0AB
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0xFC18C592

0x924EE0AB
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0x3EF4B264
certainly not afraid."
0x8BA47B55

0x924EE0AB
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0x5249D350

0x924EE0AB
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0x1C535B4B

0x924EE0AB
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0xBC4E88BA
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0xA378BAB6
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x6891270B
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0xAC94FA66
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0xF41C8C1A
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0x21C60DE7
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0xFD6F08B2
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x29A6710B
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0x7C9B4C44
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0x2D321204
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0xB516284D
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0x263CB0AE
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0xC378A1B8
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0xD1E1A76C

0x924EE0AB
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x98E92B2A

0x924EE0AB
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0xC118F6F5
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0xB993B520
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0x59E4B5CA
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0x14CA228F
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0x41564342
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0x4C2C0248
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0x216AAC12
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0xDEE2F64F
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x609997C9
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x5675A0EA
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0x7431AABF
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0x2AB660D2
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0x8EFD185F
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0x2FF7E686
will be realised."
0x6FDA9F30

0x924EE0AB
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0xFCD2861D
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x377C755B
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0xFF3E142E
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0x9F868AED
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0xE7BD6FD0
and small white satin sandals.
0xEBF536C3

0x924EE0AB
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0xEBDB46C1
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0x50282C21

0x924EE0AB
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0x71300690
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0xF5943FBB
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0xFF84D55F

0x924EE0AB
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x9D22E6C4
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0xD25D01B3

0x924EE0AB
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x18E18959
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0xF1C95DDB
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x95A7C343
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x3C201DF0
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0x762F4410
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0xFC85C9C4
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0xD8C0D642
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0x3C180442
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0xDF3C65D9
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x1D97143C
Good-night."

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XV
0x62A643E0

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0xFE17A324
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0xA1D90DFF
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0x2E23CAD9
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0xDDB206AD

0x924EE0AB
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0x10B6937C
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0xCB41D281
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0xCB9045BD
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x107C9FD0
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x1EEA1848
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x95BC3495

0x924EE0AB
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x8CDFAD0D
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x639E07AA
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xFDE57C19
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0xD08DD5C4
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0x55CC3190
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x64E807A3
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0xD628A0DE
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xEB31D15C
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0xF6E5C618
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0x77393380
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x07B594A2
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x8A394557
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x7DE96957
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0x19FD01ED
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x27D7BB49
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x39A83A6A
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x58E279A3
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xCA13EA0A
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x89B8992B
now, if you will excuse me."
0x45AC9469

0x924EE0AB
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0xA0971327
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x00D70123
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x5A70B60E

0x924EE0AB
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x7B391135
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x1DC55B3A
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0x8DBE87A0
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x3B09FAB1
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0x49707CA8
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0xB3A7E568
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x378E59AE
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xD538F568
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0xD3498C57
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0x88117CE7
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x3755821B
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x2234CDD0
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0xA5B41969
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x646CC957
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0xC9A74D4E
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xADF540B7
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x23A09C8F
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x65B34170

0x924EE0AB
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x5B4803A8
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0xBBF0D38F
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0x1B5D2608
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x7CAF5513
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0x44339662
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x2627C008
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x586C6B3D
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0x3FACDCA4
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x3B6CE8EF
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0x3B77A7D6
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0xEB1AF997
current--as I am now.
0x448A9281

0x924EE0AB
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0x50FA5F8C
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0x2FC34E90
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0xAFB0EEF3
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x6B432EF7
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x98AF0E87
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xF5CC3211

0x924EE0AB
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x05B6EEA8
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0xA4C9116C
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0x561E581C

0x924EE0AB
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0xA568CBE8
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x93F195FC
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x79B5A55E
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x7A283B7C
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x56E7BCA2
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0xF00FF01E
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xCD6D4CBA
his countenance: he went on--
0xF4679914

0x924EE0AB
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x312D4240
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x417E4BA4
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x943B537D
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x43DE2668
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0xA2D2ABF8
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0xC261798A
if you dare!'
0xA823175B

0x924EE0AB
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x85CBECBF
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0xF1047A70
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x1E0BFC4C
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x968487DA
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xF72F7A78
but straw and rotten wood."
0x476B13A3

0x924EE0AB
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0xDBEA52BB
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x05363C29
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x47A06FED
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0xB98D6764

0x924EE0AB
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x5CB293FE

0x924EE0AB
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x10FEFF89
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0xD8A5F5CC
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xCA61E183
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xE6A8AE5E
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0x5B0BC64F
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x85CC04C2
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x7E3EEF80
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x74A729A3
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0x4F45F4DD
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0x91AB338B
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x5D67DF34
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0xAF3AB3D8
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x51BB8339
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xED05DA45
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0xCB92CD0E
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0xE3C6168D
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0x6FE3A766
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x458E4B11
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x26D071AC
After this digression he proceeded--
0x977DEEB4

0x924EE0AB
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0xEE923EAC
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0xB3FB5A7C
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0xF0382987
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x2D80B83D
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0xFD244404
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x1C1FAB85
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0x85096206
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0xEE47DD72
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0xC890EB2F
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x42C8BC87
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x86ED1213
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0x0D0DAA41
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x89153433
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xB6674D20
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x147393AA
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0xE285A5DE
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0x73E175ED
who had been her dupe.
0xC65DC61D

0x924EE0AB
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xDA244C08
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0xF66C0096
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0xB39A308C
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x479D2EB9
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0xB2D7AB41
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0x818ACED0
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x00F6AE87
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0x432844B7
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x526484D2
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x137C0CDE
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0xACEA806C

0x924EE0AB
Adele here came running up again.
0xF6C35DF9

0x924EE0AB
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0x4D17E42F
wishes to see you."
0xB83BAFAE

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x6140024F
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x96E4AE70
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0xFA627024
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xF65AED37
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0xA1441227
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0xE7136F9E
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x6D6D130E
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0xCF002F3E
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x6DF5435B
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0x75DE08F3
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xF8E5A0BF
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0xE2F7357B
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0xB0F9559F
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0xAB3EABAA
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x4CF805D3
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x2E9F09FB
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0xB3AE1B1B
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0xCBDC3D4B
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xC1EAD3AD
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x643E59EF
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0x26777F4D
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x34F2719D

0x924EE0AB
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x573E33C1
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0x9D126414
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0xA1E6593B
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0x794A64FA
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x7302C449
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x747F6900

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x91E2B09D
you too: it darkens."
0xFDC8B1BB

0x924EE0AB
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0xD5974AEA
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x1F45815C
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x13ACC71C
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x07B950C7
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0xAB91353B
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0xB4925DE7
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x6F9E85D0
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x16B69543
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0x00431CD3
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0x017CD21C
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x96226734
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0xD2005B37

0x924EE0AB
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0xE5C550C7
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0xB06CC7AA
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0xD2A649A3
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x097AB571
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x6F305591
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x63A30298
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x5531B1F5
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0x4E946CD6
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0xF1018B31
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0xC889E8D0
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x8535BD09
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x00238B3E
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xD0C5762C
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0xF90C5656
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x67D6E936
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0xA017AC01
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x3C3F78DE
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x70F0E70C
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x33E4C0E0
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0xDFC60AB6
benefit.
0xF4BCE9BF

0x924EE0AB
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x6138A8F4
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0xFF3BD065
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x9F48EE53
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0xC12392B7
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x8D478DFB
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xAF2B2F44
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x7DD223E2
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x433A9240
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0xF586EA24

0x924EE0AB
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0xC1923E4B
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x237DED95
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x7A24FC76
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xE4CEB74E
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0x5F8C2394
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x3EC17EB8
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xFECE862A
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0xAEC15DAA

0x924EE0AB
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x8277F6EA
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x081F04FF
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0x55D07683
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0xE67048CD
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xAE544984
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x269EB842
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0x572F6BB7
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0x4DD7DB76
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0x57B9BEFA
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x2BBFAB81
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0xF6851E94
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x51A09C91
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0xEE5CB341
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0xE9AB3BAB
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0xE9ECD61A
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0x05643F6D
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x822BA0E6
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x929DD1AC
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x35DFB8B4

0x924EE0AB
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0x633F85BA
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0x2835368F
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0x256B274E
Thornfield.
0x38A43756

0x924EE0AB
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x2DBF4F84
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x7B1DE374
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x1DA05060
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x8E08CD34
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0x51EDAFB0

0x924EE0AB
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x0AC9CE85
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0xCEC1EE4A
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0xAACA7D57
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x45B56AEF
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x0B260B07

0x924EE0AB
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x9046BB8D
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x7417DA5D
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x0A9E7933
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x0527AD08
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0xB9E38C0A

0x924EE0AB
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xD5CAC40A
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x8440A75D
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x10594350
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0xEA6D2705
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0x4B378FB2
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x9BC47C44
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xD54048C7
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x497F351F
enough.
0x553A4B6A

0x924EE0AB
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x209B1A62
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x8C6629E4
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x46AB4FEF
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x671499C3
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0xFAEB5617
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0x08B491D6
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0xEB4A62EA
there?"
0xB6B8EC34

0x924EE0AB
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x9F88191E
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x3AD97B9E
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x5D90C6F2

0x924EE0AB
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0xF15849B4
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0x190E7C8C
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0xE4E28BB2
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0xF330655F
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0xB6920619
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0x27C5BACB
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xD8776CC5
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0x3C77FA38
burning.
0x54B4DDC9

0x924EE0AB
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x83F07DE3
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x96519057
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x28651C68
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x33858B7C
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x39858E86
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x2978C383

0x924EE0AB
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0xF6AEE6B5
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0xAF066FC2
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xC2C29FFD
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x31A01FAE
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x7B9F6AA9
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x2CAD144A
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x354F660C

0x924EE0AB
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x1C2DE084
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xC991579D
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0x8382DD0D
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0xBA023CDB
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xF077297C
water.
0x14BC578C

0x924EE0AB
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x184D385A

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0xDD868725
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x87F368CF

0x924EE0AB
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0xE6461506
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0xD1369D9E
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0xCC983D0F

0x924EE0AB
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x59556D5A
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x025053B7

0x924EE0AB
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x2134007B
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x882A30B6
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0xCD0398C9

0x924EE0AB
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x106AD64F
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0xEA7E4F66
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xE47AF5F8

0x924EE0AB
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x2816FAD1
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0xDF9D5502
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0xBF7AD6AF
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x4658D28E
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xF55C89DF

0x924EE0AB
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xEE937642

0x924EE0AB
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0xC522DAB1
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0x2E7AFB72

0x924EE0AB
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x6B420841

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0xFF43C273
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x34759DA2

0x924EE0AB
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xD9DD7AA2

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xA4A34E93
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x1A8EDE65
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x45342834
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0x3A123689
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0xA00F551D
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x7487CEDB
move, remember, or call any one."
0xA2267D19

0x924EE0AB
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0x58AF3BC8
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x07BACE61
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0x41F7EBF9
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0xBB29CD73
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x49BBB4D4
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0xC84F8588
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0x69255F00
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0xEBC3AE04
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0xD0E58CC2
"and not something worse."
0x0C4E6140

0x924EE0AB
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x38292A55
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0xBC0AF892

0x924EE0AB
"How, sir?"
0xEF146AB4

0x924EE0AB
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x1446C58A
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0xC55FAC36

0x924EE0AB
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xC581B4DC
door."
0xC2DF386A

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0x788E5474

0x924EE0AB
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0x368A7F1A
think, or something like it?"
0x717E366B

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x24CC594A
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x305EFD14

0x924EE0AB
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0xD184BC4C
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0x6E8B8448
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x51C9FB4D
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x183B63A5
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0xD4F0DC7C
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0xC7B1824D
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x3CC6E68B
hours the servants will be up."
0x9D29BE6D

0x924EE0AB
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x86FFFC61

0x924EE0AB
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0x4899E924
go.
0xC0D666FD

0x924EE0AB
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xF5CDCE16

0x924EE0AB
"You said I might go, sir."
0x23107314

0x924EE0AB
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x3ADC6F40
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0xC1E7FA63
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0x47D7D049
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0x4A98C588
At least shake hands."
0x23CFCBAA

0x924EE0AB
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xE6B963CE
both his own.
0xD4FAAA3F

0x924EE0AB
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x791F8483
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x6E4C8F6F
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0xFF3C692E
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x16A47798

0x924EE0AB
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x5188318B
his voice was checked.
0x4BE3CF01

0x924EE0AB
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0xA351C1BD
in the case."
0x2612ACCF

0x924EE0AB
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0x6F2F3F9A
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0x203DD0D5
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xEEA042BA
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xAAB614FE
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x1B6EC64D
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0xECCE0610

0x924EE0AB
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x8DCE5E02

0x924EE0AB
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x45D16CF0

0x924EE0AB
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x6131D8A9

0x924EE0AB
"I am cold, sir."
0xBD3DA986

0x924EE0AB
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x5666D321
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0x94764920
expedient.
0x949FCFCB

0x924EE0AB
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x30F54F7C

0x924EE0AB
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0xA5485069

0x924EE0AB
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x194C19F6
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x3C2C1E39
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xC53329B5
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x4B0D9079
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0x4BE65649
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x431E0253
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x11507953
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0xC9083805

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XVI
0x6DF8CCB1

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0xD4AFFAC0
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0x302CDF40
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x3BEF557A
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0xC1259BA2
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xB9516B75
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x54E74B61

0x924EE0AB
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x62530FEF
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0x504AC7D1
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x2AC384A9
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x2A80CF8C
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0x11A6E789
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x876A3FDD
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xDEAFBEA4
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xB56D6167
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0xC5274CB3

0x924EE0AB
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0x7E82E560
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0xEAE2984B
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0x2C2B2BCF
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x1FA80BE0
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x951AE2DD
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0xC1E87BCE
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0x4F3F86AE
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x72CF7D4B
no other than Grace Poole.
0x0CA153B0

0x924EE0AB
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x7E41C5CB
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x7E3E5BA1
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0x427A4F39
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xF9FDC1F7
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x4F6FE097
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x0081A406
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0xE4F04A0D
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x1144C0A4
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0xE640549D
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x7B6F1227
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x5C64842C
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0x78C772AA
went on with her sewing.
0xEF0D9075

0x924EE0AB
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0xC6B3AC12
is past comprehension."
0x13A7070C

0x924EE0AB
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x3ABF2B78
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0xAC2FE36B

0x924EE0AB
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x10943368
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xAF21755F
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0x7350BBA5
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x01C85C79

0x924EE0AB
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0xA8776CAF
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0xE1FE155C

0x924EE0AB
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x716EC792
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0xD0E8A4C9
she answered--
0xAFC19F9D

0x924EE0AB
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x3951C278
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0xC5F46835
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x3D099F6F
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0xAC321EBC
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x71A14DB9
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x77B2E1B6
a noise?"
0xB8DE6FBC

0x924EE0AB
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x23379AB8
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0x8D0CA1A2
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0x33F0ECE7

0x924EE0AB
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x77313D11
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x579A1EDA

0x924EE0AB
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x30423842
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0xFEA511BE

0x924EE0AB
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0xB7299FF6
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x1F12FF38
conscious eye.
0xC7E18700

0x924EE0AB
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0x87563895

0x924EE0AB
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0x3AEE009D

0x924EE0AB
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0xB3BB14DF
gallery?" she further asked.
0xD6F1254D

0x924EE0AB
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x4F56A895
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0xAEAD3CA1
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0xF48597C0
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0x68555D41

0x924EE0AB
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x0A22EDA3

0x924EE0AB
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x1AB5C7C5
you get into bed?"
0xC28E4AEA

0x924EE0AB
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0xC64D2D78
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x609CC9B6
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0x4BDE6075
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x82330BB5
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x9918E9FA
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x45739E4C
lie down."
0x323E91FB

0x924EE0AB
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0xC7053044
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0x132ACBD9
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0x534530E9
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0xA262E7ED
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0xB73F56FD
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x6F5F244C
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x123C3659
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0xC81BB9D7
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x1E72D273
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xD9479BAA
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x96D5C5C2
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0xA536038E
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x460C5FC7

0x924EE0AB
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x9B8D3D2B
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x403CB5CD
entered.
0x16A3374B

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x3646E91B
be ready: will you come down?"
0x226C7217

0x924EE0AB
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x3060440F
carry it upstairs."
0x19B9C9BE

0x924EE0AB
"You'll have some meat?"
0xD2BA5495

0x924EE0AB
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x5E93E197

0x924EE0AB
"And the sago?"
0x5D8B0395

0x924EE0AB
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0xD3F72B5B
make it myself."
0x605AF356

0x924EE0AB
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x23073373
so I departed.
0xF0E7FD89

0x924EE0AB
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0xA9DB05B4
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0xCC61C2D4
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0xCCBE124E
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0xC172817D
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x9F8F135E
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xDF862D62
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x07045829
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x827C422A
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x1833FBA7
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xC8030F67
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x2578C773
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x591FB13E

0x924EE0AB
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x53BE4FEA
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x1E0E0B6B
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xF130ADC5
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x4E33C823
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0x9C80506E
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0xB372838B
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x058C96BC
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xF260B763
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0xFC839CB1
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x9172069A
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xF7EE5E68
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0xB6D494A3
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0x72968C38
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0xEABC34B2
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0xBC6CE799
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0xFADE2666
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0xF7D461CE
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0xE825BC59
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0xA7FAA865
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xA758D22F

0x924EE0AB
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0xEFA6D136
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0xA108DE56
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x4B29E546

0x924EE0AB
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x730566F1
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0x1E18813C

0x924EE0AB
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xFD8AA077
thinking.
0x5341FEEE

0x924EE0AB
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x818DD918
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xAD93417F
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0xD3E0EC98
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xD1E50178
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x291CECBB
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0x8667A2B6

0x924EE0AB
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0x64CFD15F
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0xE3DEF3C4
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xA8FF0185
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0xED6222D9
impatient."
0x23E05C70

0x924EE0AB
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0x1AD4FD9B
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x9EA73EDF
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0xF2250953
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x344E7337
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x74C2F995
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x27C3C5AC
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x2356A66E
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x016582D8
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x570CFCF1
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x230CF228
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0xDCEF585C
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0xF82426EE
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x80F8D4E4
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x0100568B
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xA43ABC14
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0x975C4E3B
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0xC73E57A8
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x4CDA5FC7
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x95B8ADC2

0x924EE0AB
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x28CC9B00
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x2F45FDDE
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x95266D33
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x809BAFF6

0x924EE0AB
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x05B6B218
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xFD0DC708
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0xFA2FC257

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x621E6314

0x924EE0AB
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x05D85D53
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0xD66B21C5
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0xCE6BBC97
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x172452AE
deepening into total obscurity.
0x159279EB

0x924EE0AB
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0xC0CA6564
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x7FB6D3C6
his journey."
0x3951FC70

0x924EE0AB
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x20911873

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x030C52DE
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0xD3073A41
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x9983624B
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x1E4E0EDD

0x924EE0AB
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x718861D3

0x924EE0AB
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0x40B737C6
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0x82672C1E
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x29A404D7
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x2E1D18A6
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0xDD697763
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xDC1F6FF4
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x240660F0
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x01C95F2D
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0x54C55079
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0xCD0EF918

0x924EE0AB
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0xEA90C802

0x924EE0AB
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x61CCCF33
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0xF660CFEB
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x1BFE176B
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x9B22F085
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x44C950B6
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xAB415EEB
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x0C6C44A5
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0x46B91C8E
the evening."
0x8A9BB5F5

0x924EE0AB
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x5A16B01B

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0xFEB20CE5
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xDF90873B
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0x4F6B7C3C
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x176C3410
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x8B172F15
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x1ACF13BC
was certainly the queen."
0x7C1E2B60

0x924EE0AB
"And what was she like?"
0x88CA2079

0x924EE0AB
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0x21C15649
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0xD613083A
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xFDB8C3DA
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x1264FE1C
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x00B0BD54
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0xBBD86CB4
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x664E45D6
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x38FBE3DC
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x49B077BC
jetty mass of her curls."
0xD2A94C87

0x924EE0AB
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x5AAC7406

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x1504EB75
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0xA5C5CEAE
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x450D2A94

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0x81921D2D

0x924EE0AB
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0x951555C6

0x924EE0AB
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0x3F282DFD

0x924EE0AB
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0x6ED3BA21
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0xDCF512F1
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x2406EEDD

0x924EE0AB
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0xA36A0FAA

0x924EE0AB
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0x93314542
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0x54F38560
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0x45FA5F17

0x924EE0AB
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x2FFD3017
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x655F39D6

0x924EE0AB
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0xECF77DDA
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0xCBBE54CE

0x924EE0AB
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0x1F581EF5

0x924EE0AB
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0x94DEBD76
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0xD3D74591
began tea."
0xE8A86F4F

0x924EE0AB
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0xF1CB9208

0x924EE0AB
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x6A050D43
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0xE4AA8B15
conversation was turned into another channel.
0x95516B3B

0x924EE0AB
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0x8797388F
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x43076F43
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0xE01F176F
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0x752A7260

0x924EE0AB
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x226EBE2C
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0xAA0E2659
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0xD5B1D089
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0xE7294D39
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x237AACB1
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x0EB6C1A5

0x924EE0AB
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x12718DE0
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x540E2FB8
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x172784E6

0x924EE0AB
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0x8EC0125F
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0xFA8E6065
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x87DA489C
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0xE561219C
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0xFA2EAC84
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x9A8F5913
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0x6F2EE560
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0x6E5C5CF6
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0xDD6833DE
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xC99FFB8A
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0xA09D4394
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x7C0F4BF5
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x3B8929DA
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x773CEEAC
is no extrication.
0x2A09783E

0x924EE0AB
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x2E375AAE
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xF93291D6
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x21A51EEE
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x4C16B8F4
poor, and plain.'
0xD4F5DD57

0x924EE0AB
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0xB7C0F8B5
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xFB1B391E
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0xF7875D81
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xEC2054C8
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x8465C35D
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x3544366C
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x8F1091D7
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x12F33890
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x4834C7D6
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x79250B1A
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x8965BFBD
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0x58630AF2
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xECC950EB

0x924EE0AB
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0x535116CF
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x107AE1FA
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x186701C5
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x7847B1D1
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0xC8CAD6A8

0x924EE0AB
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x7CB13D59
calm, and fell asleep.
0x0EA63862

0x924EE0AB
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0x84437A44
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x60E6DEE7
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0xB79272AE
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x18EDF684
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x084EBF7D
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x216DC8CB
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x61C99DBD

0x924EE0AB
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0xB4A8B683
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x234928B7
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0xE9A9464E
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x46145A2F
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0xC8233314

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0x469644C3
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0x560F188E
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xBB4AD7CC
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xD8A55F53
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0x1A8C7508
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x352C896E
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0xE46B8152
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x8D80C1BC
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xCDA03B69
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0xE1C9A5A9
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x6961BE4C
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0x71C0E98A
on the contrary, I just said--
0x88CC7C2F

0x924EE0AB
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x500A2819
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x7DA52EF7
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xED1AF30C
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0xC1C35D4D
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x6694EC99
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xC6C9D43A
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x35E41728
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0x3D1726F9
wanted and would be despised."
0xC605A389

0x924EE0AB
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0xB88F6FB2
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x72E946C3
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x4F3D99A2
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x1E049433
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0xDB93AEDB

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x10239A25
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x0E92620F

0x924EE0AB
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x2FFD88E3
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0xD911CFD8

0x924EE0AB
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x36E39102
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x466D3011
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x661993A1
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0x7290E924
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0xE31F84B5

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x0BCCF8BF
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x87F77F47
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x4BB7D646

0x924EE0AB
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x1B002908
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x548B123F
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0x355170C7

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x423AACD1

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x40CD0CB3
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0xDEE2D35F
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x8291C698
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x7A48952D
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0xAF1F3973
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x6AF3EE98
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x23D99605
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x78FB1447

0x924EE0AB
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x8AA14452
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x514D20EF
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0xB5F7947E
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x3BFB5689
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x9626C447
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xBE75CD36
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x65E26116
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0x93B488DD
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0xAF210554
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x66C89123
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x9173749E
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0xAF670B2A
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x4261537F
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0xE49EC478
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x69063F74
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0x5D2D5B6F
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0xEA8C2C64
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x74D1D864

0x924EE0AB
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0x14CBDD8B
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0xF6700E2D
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x381F55CD
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0xC9210009
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x0271DFAD
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x849E5510
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x6779CFC9
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0xF5EA93B5
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0x9DE92092
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0xBFBC1ACE
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x0B01ABEB
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x69B612BF
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x4B27C951
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x9556CDDE
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0x158E452C
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0x86CDBB7B
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x444A69BB
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x68BE22EC
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0xCDC76733
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0xDA00EF75

0x924EE0AB
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x5DA6CC99
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0x62122987
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x2B1DE037
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x41410797
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0xAD8E7314
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x64A2DC92

0x924EE0AB
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x5177E420

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0xA32DF410
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x5609E64D
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0xC927494D
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0xC2B6FAEA
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0xCF728410
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xC8955BD9
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x528CEEEF

0x924EE0AB
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0xE0B3E9CA

0x924EE0AB
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x4A1D6058
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0xD4231CE4
the money she gets."
0x96C12F97

0x924EE0AB
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0xF0DECB61

0x924EE0AB
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x4945E0B0
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0x0EF5B14C

0x924EE0AB
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x3EFE6AFD

0x924EE0AB
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x1186BC21
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0xB48E60F2
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x2FDA8134
excluded.
0x293A1864

0x924EE0AB
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0x921C919C
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x619DBB66
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xE48F57E0
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x5F106223
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x60FC61C6
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0xC1D6487F
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x25F15C17
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0x4A0B2E3E
sides.
0x7984D072

0x924EE0AB
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x4ACA2A2C
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0x1C4CC37D
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x1C21AEFD
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0xF9225FAD
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0x6A8F1F03
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0xF043F288
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x60585A39
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x95F81B32
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0x29365F6E

0x924EE0AB
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x981DE560
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x4799AF78
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x7333ECD0
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0xDA55E135

0x924EE0AB
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0x2204FE77
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x7E79C392
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xAE021738
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x16BB85DB
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x63F048F7
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x1056818B

0x924EE0AB
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x5C8098D9
minutes."
0x1ABA0B0E

0x924EE0AB
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x76FC8AE5
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0xA387C066

0x924EE0AB
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0xB1AAD989
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x705AA285
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x75F1016F
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xD180A703
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x67F82899
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xCC749A56
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x59BDF855
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x8334E497
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0x6A867C41

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xB7239B83
below.
0x3F12265F

0x924EE0AB
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0x02FA49CD
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x4878BA04
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x6ACDF06A
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0xE667F633
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x22BBA6B4
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x4421C450
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x303F8979

0x924EE0AB
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0xB3AA725B
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x7D203C31
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0x7432A69E
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x264E939D
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0xC906EAE8
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x84DFDB3C
and, for a time, a hush.
0xF73DCEB3

0x924EE0AB
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x77A915C6
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0xA08C87BF

0x924EE0AB
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0x99A53B78
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x15C4F690
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0x6C1F51D7
on apprend."
0xA9E04DE1

0x924EE0AB
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0x07691325

0x924EE0AB
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xBD023362
mange."
0xD10B4127

0x924EE0AB
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xE21D8BDE
get you something to eat."
0x26B87886

0x924EE0AB
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x939A9DDE
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0x4C3CAC31
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0xB4DA428A
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xE0FC6F12
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x00D3B366
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x8FFEB4EA
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0xB4B96CCA
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x126121AF
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x3B8DD7DB
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0x69B2BFB1
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x62F405EE
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x76C757AE
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0x70D67674
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0xE1595B1E
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x36018AC9
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x1BBAE600
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0xD6A8BF0D

0x924EE0AB
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0xFFEB6412
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x1563162C
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x1DFBA930
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0xAFB51312
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x516290D4
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0xB9EE5662
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0xB6B9483C

0x924EE0AB
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x326AE959
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x1FF7E1C2
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x06837FE6
dinner?"
0xD8AEB926

0x924EE0AB
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0xB803473D
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x8FC3AF0B
is your dinner."
0x027873FC

0x924EE0AB
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0xC1773408
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x4F6D4EF4
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x450AFC1B
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x767B94D0
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0xAD3DAB96
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x56A33514
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x6E16F794
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x91D6F125
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0x96DFF296
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0x427E2CDE
quel dommage!"
0x39E69701

0x924EE0AB
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x0B27789D
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x423F74D9
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x90B51579
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xCDC429BB
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x5FB1B4A7
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0xF6149B05
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x0155DB7B
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x211F2B35
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x05EB4178
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x942BECF9
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x89370702
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x1E12CC25
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x56D96D52
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xE51A3472

0x924EE0AB
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0xB506B628
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x9D8B7175
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x63F6AE70
sought their chambers.
0xBD1B21BC

0x924EE0AB
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0x8494FD58
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0xE340C9BB
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0xD7B6604B
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x79478DAF
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x6E5FA442
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x0EBC7F69
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0xBC7B7DB5

0x924EE0AB
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0xC76DD0C7
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x73D7AD82
ladies."
0x295FF22A

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0xF447213F

0x924EE0AB
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0x0776F030
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xAAED51C8
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0xFA8C5774

0x924EE0AB
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0xD2F57C7F
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0x18D8C974
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x24C72CC3
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0x218DED2F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0x3968DB14
answered.
0xB1647145

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x35EA7203
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x9ECD7C9F
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0xC496512A
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xB900689A
case of contumacy.'"
0x561620F8

0x924EE0AB
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x554185F0
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x03362AAA

0x924EE0AB
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x013DC99F
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0x95CD4C57
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0x5BF8A247
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0xA3B0D4EA
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0x5BD8CE60
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x70F212EC
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0xFE1B926E

0x924EE0AB
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x8E64459B

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0x3C6249EA
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0xA381A759
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x69760816
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0xA1CE144E
stay at Thornfield."
0x78BDFCBA

0x924EE0AB
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x15D07241
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x6D266665
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0x9AB3DB92
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x269F844D
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x021E67F9
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0xDB48A3A8
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xE92D3132
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x4A8400F3
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0x09E5AC97
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xD1DB89A1
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x16C7C734
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0x86AE4B7A
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x446765BA
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xDC38FB80
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x1ACCA11E
descended.
0x7BEAD313

0x924EE0AB
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x45BC8275
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0xD7AFC9BD
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0x1AF475FE
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0x49DF8466
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0x90CE177E
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x9C51F362
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0xD3961805
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x3ABEEBCA

0x924EE0AB
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0x5B1DA4EA
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xFA8ECC76
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x4CD4F5AB
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xC522E034
touched my knee.
0x2658D904

0x924EE0AB
"What is it, Adele?"
0xEA7540C0

0x924EE0AB
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x764AA53C
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0xC80E8868

0x924EE0AB
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x02C3F3E2
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x7BA9C174
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x99ED7A71
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0xFC9CDF5C
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x55666746
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x24802F7B

0x924EE0AB
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0x077BFBB1
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0xC7B8A48F
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0xD938C8BB
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x5D269FAA
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0xD8431AEA

0x924EE0AB
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0xDA3F470E
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xF1D76290
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0xA1731661
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0x139F3DBD
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x32C7BC6E
stared at me.
0x163441FE

0x924EE0AB
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x43051978
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0x6F8B3340
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x3330518F
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0xD0EC7307
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x000A494E
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0xD8DB881E
and may as well mention them now.
0xD55EEBD5

0x924EE0AB
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xC4DBE8F4
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x4BE5B8E5
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xA8A792CC
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x3F9789D0
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0xDD9CABB0
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0xEC5D124B
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x5121C1E3

0x924EE0AB
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x29504148
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x986411AC
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x253EFDD5
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x3FD89409

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xCAB79918
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0x6A34FB23
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x39FF68B9
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0x724A60BA

0x924EE0AB
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0xD3233FE2
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x63EA025F
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0xCA9556A9
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0xA8242D8B
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0xE6AD15BF
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x0D87A4A5
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0x2C1AB0A6
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x0C7932D3
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x1AAFA74A
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x6F139280
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0xC878C48F
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xA1CB3C83
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x4B8D244C
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x0D100ACF
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xADA62C7D
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0xD143DAB3
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0x3DDD0387
truly imperial dignity.
0xB6328535

0x924EE0AB
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0xDC9BC5A2
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0xFC215653
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0xCFEF17BF
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0xDBDEFC22
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xBF5C0EBB
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x848E47EC
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x097FB66E

0x924EE0AB
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x1620FA97
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x12F8674F
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x426F97EF
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xEDEF7EA0
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0xF88D845F
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x19E76CF6
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x25A44BED
haughty lip.
0xD3B46261

0x924EE0AB
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x25CE9BC4
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x79D5C755
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0xA4E05A71
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x46AA85E1
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x921FBF56
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xC4DDA2BF
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x4CAD7C14
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x4D92F67E
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0xEFC7DCB5
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xF5D5D573
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x06C8013B

0x924EE0AB
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0xFE9DDC47
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0xE36A0B49
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x16A53E89
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0xCF76994A
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x008E2DCF
in spotless white.
0xB27EED83

0x924EE0AB
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0x80667057
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x75EC2D7F
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x4917C266
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0xFD23944C
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x3F11033C
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x308A2E42
together.
0x28F1C862

0x924EE0AB
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x95BC2F46
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0xFFCCA374
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x2B4DB56B
gravity--
0xD40AA75A

0x924EE0AB
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xDC097667

0x924EE0AB
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0xC7571DCE
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0x9E7019F6

0x924EE0AB
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x89EB40D0
little French girl he was speaking of."
0xDA911837

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x6DF2632D

0x924EE0AB
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x8BD772C1
child!"
0x255DD91E

0x924EE0AB
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xE2EC53D9
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x575CC351
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x55F3E65D
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x292015D5

0x924EE0AB
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xF19D7976
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0xB0FEA72E
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x221AF83E
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xCC637BB2
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x1BED74A1
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x75296C4D
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x65403A0D
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x0EC92E35
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0xFF624BB6
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x788F99B5
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x89107C85
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0x1A81B651
blood or vigour of brain.
0x7F9EAAAA

0x924EE0AB
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0xE5B9CC65

0x924EE0AB
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x7DF40F65
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0xC40604A7
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x45E7BC89
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0xBE3FC315
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x96034FDE
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0xB5AD6169
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x5912B419
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xF7BDD2D9
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0xE01FB3BB
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0x1F99CAA8
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0xFBB9C0D1
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0x71D14FB3
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x3FA6BAFF
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x65C3C94E

0x924EE0AB
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x73227E2C
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x3CA9DC31
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x9ACE9AF2
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0x77D22D22
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0x2EABDE1E
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x37809CD6
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xE4D640C6
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x2EE1C8AC

0x924EE0AB
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x048341AF
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x569B08E6
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x161F97A4
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x30260DD2
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x6433B30F
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0xC4AAC467
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x7FE4433C
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0xC9B20BFF
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x78F37336
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0xDF02B9BD

0x924EE0AB
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0xC1D82AD7
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0x7535CEAC
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x65BB125D
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0xFCB43495
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0xDB6C661F
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xFF287111
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x8CF472D6
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0x5126579A
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0xED9EE1A2
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x55795F6F
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x965EA830
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x1CE16F0F
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x5009C7EF
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x40512A6D
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x390F27A3
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0xFABC6D59
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xCF98E63C
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xBE2285DC
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x1A1B07DA
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x3D76DFAF
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0xE41A70F5
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x03D88A85
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x56E37BFD
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xE9D95312
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xF72AD3DF
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0xD2AEA26E
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x8738387B
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x72655039
breathe and think, I must love him."
0x7AB5E041

0x924EE0AB
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x3A61A648
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0xDBC15EEB
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x17E2C7FD
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x1A2AB584
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x196DD685
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x5776A233
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0x7A3803E2
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x7E55F5AF
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0xDD13E821
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x5FB8EE00
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x66EEE791
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0xDC80C0FF
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0xF6440279
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x933206A8
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0xBC14B668
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0x52BD4BEC
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x80C140C2
selects a mate.
0x88D38418

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0xC5DDACDF
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x8B81E3C7
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0x34C3A840

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x9BE71434

0x924EE0AB
"Nor am I."
0xC1D971E3

0x924EE0AB
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x6CB9C4CA
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x5E1418A8

0x924EE0AB
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x838792D0

0x924EE0AB
"You should have sent her to school."
0x3AD54E6A

0x924EE0AB
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0x24D163F3

0x924EE0AB
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0x3C0E9FBC
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x357F8BE3
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0xF04266F1
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0xA125FF6A

0x924EE0AB
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xB3525995
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x8784D245
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0x12DF1FBD

0x924EE0AB
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0xA584E045
straight before him.
0xC1D6E9AE

0x924EE0AB
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0xA21A5318
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0x3335835A
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x4680AE69
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x173C9969

0x924EE0AB
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x4D424B03

0x924EE0AB
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x943E65D0
her question with an explanation.
0xF2EF8994

0x924EE0AB
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0xAE1F762C
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x9DC52386
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0xF16314A6

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0xAB113857
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0xC360E34C
the anathematised race was present.
0xD801BB63

0x924EE0AB
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0x20C75A7B
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0x13F28AB8
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x4A77C3D0

0x924EE0AB
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0x733D2D12

0x924EE0AB
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x829C469E
three times with portentous significancy.
0x24C8BFB5

0x924EE0AB
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0xC79436FB

0x924EE0AB
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0xDEAD641F

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0xD90020FE
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0xBE3EDF72
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0xAFCA4C3B
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x14C6FD8E
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x71840132
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0xE2CD6358
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x23F6BD22
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0xA0A4C941
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0xDA4C2639
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0xF9E72753
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0x77B223FA
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0x1833479F

0x924EE0AB
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0x63B8E85F
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x84836144
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x82AC4DD4
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x63439A1B

0x924EE0AB
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0xB1E40498
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x2027A21E
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0x22DA5B4A
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x2A539B71
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0xD059E144
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0xAD91AC3C
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xBD90C80C
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0xAF45CBD2
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0xFE327228
lady-mother?"
0x552CC0E6

0x924EE0AB
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0xC6BB08CE
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x36C22888
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0x3EEB4498

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0x8ED84986
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0xFF393311
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0x770E8C17
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0x1BB53662
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0x2CE849DC

0x924EE0AB
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0x63398775

0x924EE0AB
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0x8883EE7B

0x924EE0AB
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x26758515
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0x641FFA1A
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0xA2D408E1
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0x6457F7A2

0x924EE0AB
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0xF1B0B2C6
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0xF72F8C8A
she would give us anything we asked for."
0x18BD0E83

0x924EE0AB
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0x06D98DDE
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0xB5F0E7AD
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0xDCAF3589
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0xF38748DD

0x924EE0AB
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x8F5BD147

0x924EE0AB
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x656AFE81
in voice to-night?"
0x2B56BDBA

0x924EE0AB
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0xBE75092B

0x924EE0AB
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0xF9DBD503
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x27D815E9

0x924EE0AB
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0x23F3D576

0x924EE0AB
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0xB64B429C
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0x699D5C43
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0xCDAAE238
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0xCEE2EE9D
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0xDCD6EAD8
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0x8D839DD2
hand."
0xF99E13C3

0x924EE0AB
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0x326D6712
Mr. Rochester.
0xB3678AEF

0x924EE0AB
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0x66DE5AB7

0x924EE0AB
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0xD41B776D

0x924EE0AB
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0xD0CDB476
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0xEECEEA80
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0xE27672C7
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x4FCFFA2E
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x53CB016D
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x96B79A4C

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0xB744FC80
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0x79B00BA4
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0x2868607F
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x82602881
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0xDB86CC79
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0x0D9103F2
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x4420BBBF
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x60B7F2D5
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0xEAC2098A
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x0910D00E
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0xF41BC412

0x924EE0AB
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x806B8880
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x311C80ED
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0xB579F997
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0x8B671252
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0x63FD2A4E

0x924EE0AB
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x10B84A92

0x924EE0AB
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0x1E68FDEA
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0x3EBCAFB6

0x924EE0AB
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0x86629FE2
water."
0x9FCA8C46

0x924EE0AB
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0x3CC6A5F4
such things _should_ be done."
0x0798B064

0x924EE0AB
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0xE60F8409
fail."
0x88ABA550

0x924EE0AB
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0xD0C013C3
proportionate punishment."
0x9F726BA2

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x2C4472A1
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0x99C34CD9

0x924EE0AB
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xAB282F93

0x924EE0AB
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0x54384A13
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0xA46ABD69
capital punishment."
0x6499257F

0x924EE0AB
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x106AD01D
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x57E0CBDE

0x924EE0AB
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0xA96FBDC5
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0x65200846
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0xACAEFC6D
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xEFBB8B53
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x0AE1F13D
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0xE2853122
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x45CCB251
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x5AD378FB
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x64C72925
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x39FA597B
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0x19D2DACE
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0xEB49E2B4

0x924EE0AB
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x9910128C

0x924EE0AB
"I am very well, sir."
0x07429AF4

0x924EE0AB
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0xB7B35866

0x924EE0AB
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0xA4239E3B
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x94EF2E77

0x924EE0AB
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0xCC4F3E17

0x924EE0AB
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x9FC2E07B

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x1A9848BB

0x924EE0AB
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0xFC8B2CAE
What is the matter?"
0x3817FED0

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x12D78AB4

0x924EE0AB
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x3EA34478

0x924EE0AB
"Not the least."
0x32C33815

0x924EE0AB
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x00083963

0x924EE0AB
"I am tired, sir."
0xF4C59E53

0x924EE0AB
He looked at me for a minute.
0xF47D6D4F

0x924EE0AB
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0xCA0F0DEA

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x1C8C4D2A

0x924EE0AB
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0xF6BB8742
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0xCFFE64E4
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x6EEB2310
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0xED3EABBF
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0xB23BD799
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x5CB7E1E2
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x0DEA39FA
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0xF4B4123D
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XVIII
0x9161249E

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x6093FF64
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0xF7CCB9C7
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x12578678
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x4908B6F7
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x22E80878
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x723898BA
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0xB681A52B

0x924EE0AB
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xBC58A184
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xC9DC1E03
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x623A99C2
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x1356AC14
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xA576925B
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0xEACD2EFD
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x63B00A0E

0x924EE0AB
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0xA940B11E
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x6F0719FA
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x17013D0B
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0xD2F85565
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xEE704B9A
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x230278EE
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x2574F216
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x8CEE944F
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0xBC7B64BD
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x28B007FB
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0xDB686A83
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0x2ECD3386
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x82E2C480
drawing-room.
0x1B2DE10B

0x924EE0AB
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0xC02E3B25
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0x3F464476
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x5AB0F030
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0xB76DFEAB
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x8F098DF9

0x924EE0AB
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0xA4C02A67
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0x0697A640
usual seat.
0x5CDD912E

0x924EE0AB
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x516BCB64
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0x0EFDC713
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xF478CEB2
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x7F5ABC55

0x924EE0AB
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x5370E9AC

0x924EE0AB
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xC88F296C
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x77FF2C39
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xA4973728
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x35EE17A6
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0xE95FDC3F
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0xC45F732B
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x6FB3BA38
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xAABAEA95
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x7C2CD74D
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x7C09F9ED
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x01AA9F24
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0xEBF5ABF4
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0xDC4BB281
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x8277B6F4
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x17DA619A

0x924EE0AB
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xA7705E12

0x924EE0AB
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0xC6AE027A
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x6125E464
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x50A2F616
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x58253029
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x3A4432C2
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x115186D1
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0xBC69D1FB
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0xDCA68106

0x924EE0AB
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x3373F94D
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x37F66EE0
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x30504D5F
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x83D0E475
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xDE50B67F
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x82DB5FC8
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x23F5A1D8
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x803973A4
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0x8CBDE7BB
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0xFD5ADDC3
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0xA5A93C83
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x0E202448

0x924EE0AB
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0xE7BD7C10
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0xFBB032CA
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0xC061935C
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xBE6A2373
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x1F08A33C
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xFAB6BCEE
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0xFC06407B
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x8D4AE8E3
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x5EA1DAC8
wanting.
0x002581D2

0x924EE0AB
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x01B6B3BC
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0xA29A44C1
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x526602A3
curtain again descended.
0xF511AE20

0x924EE0AB
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x21FB50AC
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x15C84A49
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0x8C1FA876
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0xC4950F08
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0xFEFB7BF5

0x924EE0AB
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x03BCDE6A
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x4610A6DC
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0x78973E1F
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xEEB9F58E
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0x0A33B92C
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x527F4495
attached fetters.
0x01E4E0C1

0x924EE0AB
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0xEB9C7F87

0x924EE0AB
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x73F3461C
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0xC1A0076E
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0xE070F9E6

0x924EE0AB
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x1D432D3D
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x3A8AD9C5
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x2DACBADF

0x924EE0AB
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x675603B8

0x924EE0AB
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0xF0602C5C
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x876E7557

0x924EE0AB
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0x4AAD08EE

0x924EE0AB
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x78316316
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x3D5B3763

0x924EE0AB
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xBD333052
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xCDE703E1
colour rose.
0x23639BF8

0x924EE0AB
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0xA469925D
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x490C78DD
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0x9DC6923F
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0xC64EAF54
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0xE9ECAD0B
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0xB9F6BDC9
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x3B9A886B
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0xCBB671EC
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0xB6F6EC2A
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0xA223F300
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xA8A15497
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x717ABC4B
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xCA14C0FC
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x9487DF69
returns in memory at this moment.
0x12A76915

0x924EE0AB
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0xAE4E9719
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x62B54ED6
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x0CF37BA5
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x32834C97
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0xF85DCA3C
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x2241AF88
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x9F8E1B5F
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x4F51C637
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0xA0AC160C
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x17411679
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0xDC178CD8
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0xAAFBA71D
very pride, irresistible.
0x50C5EED7

0x924EE0AB
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0x3786DE64
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x8F17958D
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x93C9A4E8
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x0A78369B
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x7ECEF7AA
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0xA9ED1915
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0x73C41509
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x2F86E874
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x095A68A8
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x88BC2E2F
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x8E77B201
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xAB0D0196
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x04C34DEB
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x65DEF5B4
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x1C4F8AC4
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0x349CBC42
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0xCE1E0248
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0xE748AA3D
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0xE16209EF
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x4F42B09D
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0x34B8F974
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0xC6D5FAA9
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x06831546
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x5E9BFDD3
torturing pain arose.
0xC7E4BC96

0x924EE0AB
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0xF874F03B
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0xC3035A54
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0x50310890
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x64331F45
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x82E19E8C
not charm him_.
0xE7E7C5AB

0x924EE0AB
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x8ECCF53A
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x0AA27269
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0xF94F038F
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x817F5429
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0xDA5180E3
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x09C9FAA8
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0xC9F7DD9E
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0xB9466B8E
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x35C8032B
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x15FA361C
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0xD310BFC0
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xDFCDBD5F
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x6B98E7D4
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x1D5B517A
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x0E3754E9

0x924EE0AB
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xBB01B96B
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xEE5FDE86
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0xE650A51E
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x86070BDA
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0xF0C394EB
silent conquest might have been won.
0x0F024548

0x924EE0AB
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0x6C0CF23B
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0x2F163546
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x15422B4D
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0xCB58EABA
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xE0593EF3
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xCF862AD8
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xA502E793
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x1E1C198D
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0xB1400F9E
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0x4F7EFC3E
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x7418ADEE
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x18660D03
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xDA00B719
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x3C7F76D3
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0xDF7993B8
shines on."
0xED294B6E

0x924EE0AB
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0xC325BB0B
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x9C024E26
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0x96112510
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xC56E26D2
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x69701F8F
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0xBA10E07D
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x7E117E2F
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x0924E043
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x7CA1E026
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x88AEF371
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xEC21C383
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x985FE025
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x6053E098
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0xBB39BCE7
as I wished to act.
0xBC2D8594

0x924EE0AB
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x72089177
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0xA960B3D2
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x39C2ACB0
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x3DDA5C3D
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x13FB8D14
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x05E1A2DB
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0xFCC3184B
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x5AAEE9F0
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x3E34BE13
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0xD726E786
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x3A2903BE
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0xAFC096EF
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x51772B63
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x6CAF446E
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x27C407FE
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0xD78B254F
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x382723D0
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0xB51C94E9
nature.
0x98D59617

0x924EE0AB
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x3178285D
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xDB483E1A
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0xA2151D47
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0xF76F6997
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x85EA084B
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x9232E055
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0xD33D36A8
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0xF6B601C3
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0xA49CD4BB
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0x437AAEBA
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x7B9C9C4B
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x8C77E619
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x7A349F28
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xA11F27C7
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x6DE7B095
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x7790873A
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0xD6E565B7
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x742F054A
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x251F982A
vivacity of conversation.
0xFE6601A4

0x924EE0AB
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x268444CC
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x362C5A1D
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0xE80F727D
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0xC5893623
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x2D235EB4
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0x8AA334D6
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x9E9C25AD
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0xBE0EC7D4
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0xBA195CEB
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0x94B4866B
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x86FF32AE
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x26C85EB9
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xE7858ADF
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x179AADA1
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0xC9AC9FEE

0x924EE0AB
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0xD5F95503
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0xBA4A2CE4
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x7B9671DA

0x924EE0AB
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x212C2CA1

0x924EE0AB
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0xE702CC30
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x3CB8C487
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xF2B11E99
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0xFCAF9D92

0x924EE0AB
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x6ECAF384
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x6F584609
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0xF19B2A86

0x924EE0AB
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x5D3EB558
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x11D40E50
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x6ED50050
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0xEF897913
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0x0B327FE5
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0x558BB8B8
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0xF01EE726

0x924EE0AB
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x68612AC6
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x552A0FF6
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xDFB93198

0x924EE0AB
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0x9B0329EA
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xF2BFCA08

0x924EE0AB
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0x8E734A40
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0xE8B1F219
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x5C48727F
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x1F9CD0FB

0x924EE0AB
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0x1EC2DDA6
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x6CBF3619
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x36DFC44A
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x2FFEF489
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x8F9FFF9A
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x2FDFCAFD
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x2320BC56
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x4878BF32
least so I thought.
0x25580B1F

0x924EE0AB
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0xE051AFCF
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0x51E66D66
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0xB5A7C48C
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xBA6E7626
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0x0AA89D7E
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0x23C0FDF9
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x137E0EA6
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x9D50718B
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xA9A08B96
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0x572202E4

0x924EE0AB
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x00C2E993
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x2D220386
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x4F92E766
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x5E84EE0D
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x5D8EE8ED
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x99FAEE94
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x46B6C748

0x924EE0AB
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0x04C6C374
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x7E90F10B
that "extremes meet."
0x56F96CBC

0x924EE0AB
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0x980DBE42
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0xC144B2E8
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x4B3B2001
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x3139D52B
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x2E8CCB19
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0xEE9CE491
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x224F6402
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x921E8017

0x924EE0AB
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0xB5D60611
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x5120BD1D
a placid eye and smile!"
0x2E50993F

0x924EE0AB
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x83069B98
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0xF9D998C9
Hay Common.
0xA4B1EB17

0x924EE0AB
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x4989931B
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x3EBB6E75
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xE512C4EA
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x57ECDBF1
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x6281B042
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xDD7DA239
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x2A4E2692
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0x76B62C36
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x1AEC1232
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0xB9EE3632
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0xCF1084FB
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0x271734BB
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0xD66377D6

0x924EE0AB
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x3E522285
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x56B6447C
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x921AB9BD
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xFF0E95CE
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0xEA408D94
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0xEDB28530
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0x89CFB9B7

0x924EE0AB
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0xCA8CB54D
off," replied the magistrate.
0x502912FC

0x924EE0AB
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0xD0CF0A9C
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x8A5F55F9
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0xA76707D6
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0xDAC39AC6
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0xF4E70355
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0x5AC762B5
see her?"
0xD05C8831

0x924EE0AB
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x629AAB51
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x56755C27

0x924EE0AB
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x5F523554
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x2C093356
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x9B0ABA2D
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x2A17C411

0x924EE0AB
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x401E78FB

0x924EE0AB
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x3FF57206
must and will do it."
0xFF7567F0

0x924EE0AB
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x0D6DA517

0x924EE0AB
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0xDC580EC4

0x924EE0AB
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0x02783BDE
in, of course."
0x55C77610

0x924EE0AB
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x18D97152
throw away such a chance of fun."
0xD2AAF655

0x924EE0AB
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0xF75BEE6A

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x094C66DB
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xE8AE7384

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x9E97484C
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x8E91EF22
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0xC0A9C40E
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x851AD3CE
forward."
0x53E65D2C

0x924EE0AB
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x9C7FA8F3

0x924EE0AB
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x2B95C3F3
Sam!"
0xEFE5FD7E

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x55981640
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x043ED281

0x924EE0AB
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x54E41F1F

0x924EE0AB
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x4B7C5CB7

0x924EE0AB
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x2A24B022
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xD2DB77A6

0x924EE0AB
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0xB4DB6FF2
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x4C86FAF1
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x4EE73519
one."
0xF671E507

0x924EE0AB
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0xCC875F7C
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0xA8F79484

0x924EE0AB
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0xF9EC6C76
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0xA11800F2
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x0D4304BF

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0xC8B7F2FD

0x924EE0AB
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0xD1CC7EF8

0x924EE0AB
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x52E00C22
once more.
0xF9E1CDD2

0x924EE0AB
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x1EAEA1D9
know who will be her first visitor."
0xC8BD850E

0x924EE0AB
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0xEF80BF77
said Colonel Dent.
0x90AE5E77

0x924EE0AB
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x44588CA9

0x924EE0AB
Sam went and returned.
0xF8E50958

0x924EE0AB
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x240C79CE
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0xAE4299D5
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x1C6A9B73

0x924EE0AB
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0x5AB15065

0x924EE0AB
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0xB2629B78
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x73DB44B8
of his men.
0xE76FAB4A

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xA5B67EBE
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x4E48F62B
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x00B96501

0x924EE0AB
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xA342492A
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x87E805BF
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0xBD7299B8
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x99B07F85

0x924EE0AB
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x06063051
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0xDBE8AE52

0x924EE0AB
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0xB32D117A
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xDF69A7CF
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x07F3E92D
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x96C8B04A

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x78915DCD

0x924EE0AB
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0xDC399AD2

0x924EE0AB
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0xB2A3E4BC
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xC8B4DD48

0x924EE0AB
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0xBB34733F
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0xE1C4BACD
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0x4EAC5EDA
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0x118053F2
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0xFD193FCA
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0xA7B900F5
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0xEAEFA74A
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xC07860F8
morning, as he threatened."
0x352EA52C

0x924EE0AB
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x6EF8B7AE
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0xB96A1F8D
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x53A3E45D
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x90164CC6
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x9F985B75
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0xC5EC0CC2
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0xA8ECAEAC
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xC9E56A6B

0x924EE0AB
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x5F5CD701

0x924EE0AB
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0x7D2805D9
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xBC452604
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0xD70F9BE7
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x361B3AA8
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0x40E68243
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0xA82698AE

0x924EE0AB
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xE08F72C5
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xB380EE73
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0x4D00E17C
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x53A8ECFD

0x924EE0AB
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0x9FD19C5F
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0xCB6E641B
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x8199F736

0x924EE0AB
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0x0D079B4D
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x93FEDDAD
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x99AA3280
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x5564ECBD
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x95824B49
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x05EED538
they most wished for.
0xEDD2B188

0x924EE0AB
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0xD4F764C5
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x330FF614
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x78B05609
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xF5F9454D
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0xB1625A7D
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xDCAFE598
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x9C92523B

0x924EE0AB
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x53700104
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x4D88F88E
saw Sam.
0xB8FA4F21

0x924EE0AB
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0xB0065700
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xC58595FB
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0xC0A2EFD6
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xA6563013

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0x736C6CF5
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x1EEB47C0
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0xA08CF34E
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xC34FDD6B
quietly behind me.
0x8ABC06BB

0x924EE0AB
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0x836DD7F5
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x4703F6B0

0x924EE0AB
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x929992CD
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x3939BE58

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XIX
0x9216BCC1

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0xDA1052E5
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0x3569B862
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0x64CD1599
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0xA25F6333
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0x8146A966
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0x0CD2FC47
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0x1F0243A4
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0x704EDC2A
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x1A4C8E0B

0x924EE0AB
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x0046961E
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0xD2BD0ACE
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x0623EE21
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x76EDEDAB
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x03B5E3BA
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0xD68F24B7
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x73BA3F1C
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0x5C911D74
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xDD01E772

0x924EE0AB
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0xD263767C
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0x99185658

0x924EE0AB
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0xDBB1F755
warn you, I have no faith."
0xC1D70711

0x924EE0AB
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0x202B9B6D
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0x5E6F5413

0x924EE0AB
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0x9B3ECD06

0x924EE0AB
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0xFBCA711D

0x924EE0AB
"You need them all in your trade."
0xC0C61E2A

0x924EE0AB
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0x3BBC6A8E
you tremble?"
0x444A9772

0x924EE0AB
"I'm not cold."
0x624AA683

0x924EE0AB
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0x7C4F9CDC

0x924EE0AB
"I am not sick."
0x4F425F19

0x924EE0AB
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0xA66A2A4D

0x924EE0AB
"I'm not silly."
0xE869790B

0x924EE0AB
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x78CD583F
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x5049D2CF
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x7590B30E
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0xEB579747
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x85F02E92

0x924EE0AB
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0xD6351004

0x924EE0AB
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0xB9F88275
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x406C4F17
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0xFA2A0DF8
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0xBC43C88F
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x53ECD320
you."
0x8D4EE5F3

0x924EE0AB
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x8B633703
with vigour.
0x40FC8C6C

0x924EE0AB
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0x1A861F45
solitary dependent in a great house."
0x197327E6

0x924EE0AB
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0x48265017
one?"
0xB50626DC

0x924EE0AB
"In my circumstances."
0x9D2FEF5C

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x7339D972
placed as you are."
0xD6AF8A5F

0x924EE0AB
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x08361239

0x924EE0AB
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0x7FB0B1C6
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x45D29C03
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0xFE38A0FD
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0x78B7DE49

0x924EE0AB
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0xC4CC20FF

0x924EE0AB
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0xC774F8F7

0x924EE0AB
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0xB6EDD47D

0x924EE0AB
"To be sure."
0x6527A85C

0x924EE0AB
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0xE5DDFCB3
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xDB994EC5
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0xBB7E7090
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0x52651B20

0x924EE0AB
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0x8B3543E0
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x97D095F4
there."
0xB042A738

0x924EE0AB
"I believe you," said I.
0x7427AD22

0x924EE0AB
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0xBD5D2174
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0x442FA983

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x69512CD1
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xE869003C

0x924EE0AB
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x1422CE52
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0x48137518
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0xBDF7B7BA

0x924EE0AB
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0xCDD48901
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x477406E0
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0x2EE44820
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0xB2DC8447
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0x8E444FB9
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0x3FB94E7C

0x924EE0AB
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0xCFEE377B

0x924EE0AB
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xE8DB312D
whispers of the future?"
0x36308205

0x924EE0AB
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x26D93AD0
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0xED3F3DF7

0x924EE0AB
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0x70CB13C0
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x41662F11

0x924EE0AB
"You have learned them from the servants."
0x45A69408

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0xB7CFCDD9
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x945FD341

0x924EE0AB
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0x757CF643

0x924EE0AB
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0x96F1F9D1
after all, then!"
0x009ADDFF

0x924EE0AB
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0xD30540D5
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0x268A797F
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0x7AC2A85A
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0x68592050
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0xF191C269
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0xB1B18B83

0x924EE0AB
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x8A11C1D4

0x924EE0AB
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0x8A6FCEA4

0x924EE0AB
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0x38B79029
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0x7B6E6CF3

0x924EE0AB
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0xB6C1952B

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0xBCFA8ED4
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0xDDD60DBC

0x924EE0AB
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0x324F9749

0x924EE0AB
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0xF5659B75

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0x625DB676
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x173BE42B
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0x1B0AFB89

0x924EE0AB
"I what?"
0xC5410BD9

0x924EE0AB
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0x2518B67E

0x924EE0AB
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0xCF6BC897
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x84C8269A
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0xA6B441C3
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x418B33FF
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0x7A5E9448
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0x79E7FD42

0x924EE0AB
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0xEB788396
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x566BD476

0x924EE0AB
"He is not at home."
0x3A885FB9

0x924EE0AB
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0x87AC45D5
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0x0226103C
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0xE3475995
it were, out of existence?"
0x66E56E69

0x924EE0AB
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0x3CB4CA5E
you had introduced."
0x7E974B06

0x924EE0AB
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0xB0C79186
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0xB197DAED
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0x2A127C80

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0xCC72D2CD

0x924EE0AB
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0x8173D786
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0xC520C027
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0xA40B1341

0x924EE0AB
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0x646647DC
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0x7A039E28
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0x32C8E4D0
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x65AB583A
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0x9062AC6B
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0x1438392C

0x924EE0AB
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0xF82410C8
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0xC70B94FC
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0xB39A9E8E
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0x0DFD69FF
noticed this?"
0x3FE7E447

0x924EE0AB
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x48C69084

0x924EE0AB
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0xB9E3E630
gratitude?"
0x8A63A523

0x924EE0AB
I said nothing.
0x19BDE707

0x924EE0AB
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x985C8F38
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0x68E498BF

0x924EE0AB
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0x1D9848FD

0x924EE0AB
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0xFF2F6BD4

0x924EE0AB
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0xB73BFBA0
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0x3087AC7A

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x1869E448

0x924EE0AB
"Shortly?"
0x631FAE48

0x924EE0AB
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0x9835ABF1
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0xF46714B3
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0x58AFF339
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0x2E1C10C1
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0xFD293338
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0x1C6B8BFD
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0x6794B3D0
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0xC626FA59
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0xCF482265
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0x56E9134B

0x924EE0AB
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0x454E8371
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0xDE80D7BB

0x924EE0AB
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0x2758CD93
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0x85C30AA7
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0x3787D98D
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x824B6488
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0xBE8429CF
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0xC0B894C4

0x924EE0AB
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0x847AC8B8

0x924EE0AB
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0x3B10352B
p190.jpg}
0xA9014457

0x924EE0AB
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x00EA8D6D
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0x8EFFB0CF

0x924EE0AB
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0xC408769D
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0xA5BCDE72
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0x1EB63CA6
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0x6BF99FD1
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0xE5938A65
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0x09CA7404
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0xB4AE6094
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0x7CE10830
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0xCCAABAF3

0x924EE0AB
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0x9F43F9BD
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0x2C98E194
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0x5B478B60
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0xAB961EDC
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0xC2A803A3
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0xFE581ED4

0x924EE0AB
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0x2E6F3BB4
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0xFB9BE3C5
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0x59FDDB51
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0x1D5FF135
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0x6E62B47A
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0x333C020F
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0xD99681E6
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0xB46332AF
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0x0F570AB3
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0x70D209B6
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0x4B425EA9
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0xFE87AC63
dictates of conscience.'
0x0C2F83BE

0x924EE0AB
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x550ABE14
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0x073EEAF9
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0x40E1D548
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0xA4734895
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0xFD9A4846
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0x3EF4364D
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0x90216B07
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x2DBAC65C
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0xB2420D56
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0xC92CEA96
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0x8AC6FB61
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0xBFC8D981
me; the play is played out'."
0x70C51291

0x924EE0AB
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x7D6D1C2E
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0xD8866FD5
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0x50CC91FC
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x4E073E3B
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0x2E506203
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0xD59A2C49
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x85CE09A6
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x0D6B3B29
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0x09CC1FFC
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0x71B3B318
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0x3802ADF1
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x110E8B13
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0x7637BA29

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x5B921E44

0x924EE0AB
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0x9D8C2457

0x924EE0AB
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x91E334A4

0x924EE0AB
"Break it, sir."
0x758F3839

0x924EE0AB
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x9FBF60B6
disguise.
0x0E0EC934

0x924EE0AB
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0x1BCA4C6C

0x924EE0AB
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0x00942640

0x924EE0AB
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x4368CB98

0x924EE0AB
"But not with you?"
0x981AF13E

0x924EE0AB
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0x79E47791

0x924EE0AB
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0xDB35EADA

0x924EE0AB
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0xC0FABA9B
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0xA4CE3D98
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x0AE27AD4

0x924EE0AB
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0xFDCD33C5

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x1C4CE31C
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x53EDA366
but it was not right."
0x107E7533

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0xEBD60B7A

0x924EE0AB
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0xD5F8FE80
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x9B978461
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0xDF2C7D55
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0x3E64D11F
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x5B429EFC
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xEFB5B048
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xDF7C84FA
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x92D3FD6A

0x924EE0AB
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x23C18E09
signify?"
0xB49BB787

0x924EE0AB
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0x91D4E99E
now, I suppose?"
0x25948170

0x924EE0AB
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0x856957BE
yonder are doing."
0xFBB7DB87

0x924EE0AB
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0xCE8356F6

0x924EE0AB
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0xEF1471A1

0x924EE0AB
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x3BF2318E
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0xE91DD1F5
left this morning?"
0xD3631B93

0x924EE0AB
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0x2D960F24

0x924EE0AB
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x9A41535E
installing himself here till you returned."
0x1707B45D

0x924EE0AB
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0xA3F27AFE

0x924EE0AB
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x1C00553C
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0xF99185E9

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0xDFA6D655
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x0E691967
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x1DC104E2

0x924EE0AB
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x308D3E3B
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0xFF18BD2F
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x8AC21FF6
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x60BDABCD
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x66594A2F

0x924EE0AB
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xAA86BAA8

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0xB219EC6C

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x1EEC09D6

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x3C4AF7B9

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0x41683AC4

0x924EE0AB
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x6649CC41
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0xF73CF628
and dreary look.
0xD8B288A0

0x924EE0AB
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0xEAF43D35
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x62DD5963

0x924EE0AB
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x815EC8E5

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x80BD4E98

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x91D15323

0x924EE0AB
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0xF90D2E38
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x03688391
doing."
0x9F5C9EFC

0x924EE0AB
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x1C943258
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x736F1169
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x987FEB3E
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x90B154CD
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xD1FC2487
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0xC3BDB20A
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xF81FE1F2
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xAB69F338
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x109E16F0

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x0ECB53D0
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0xBE2797EA

0x924EE0AB
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0xF3A62768
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0xF384A583

0x924EE0AB
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0xF70F0B7E

0x924EE0AB
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0xD5E9F225
strange?"
0xBC2F967D

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x036493F2

0x924EE0AB
"And Mason?"
0xD133C605

0x924EE0AB
"He was laughing too."
0x1B64D0BD

0x924EE0AB
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0x061A5782
Jane?"
0xC24ABD1B

0x924EE0AB
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x8C0E9877

0x924EE0AB
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x402D2A0F
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x2AFE8497
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0xB5EF8001

0x924EE0AB
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0xB296B8FE
you."
0x8D4EE5F3

0x924EE0AB
"To comfort me?"
0xD1809FFC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0xCD20BA3F

0x924EE0AB
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0xC63EBDF8

0x924EE0AB
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x3311FC4B
care nothing about it."
0x45E74D10

0x924EE0AB
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x963BC55C

0x924EE0AB
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x1969D1E5
you, I am sure, do."
0x26472C73

0x924EE0AB
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0x4CB380D3
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x65228703
and then leave me."
0x3629A4E6

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xB373FC8D
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x6FD5429E
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0xE8A12EA7

0x924EE0AB
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x3012A67B
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x32D7C5E7
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0xB2AAEB47

0x924EE0AB
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0x3E3745CD
asleep.
0xFD87ADDF

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XX
0x6E3EEA0C

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0xBB381D80
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0xACD50D7F
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0x6634B318
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x50B52CA9
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x318C96E7
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0xA271651F
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0x3237776C
the curtain.
0xD85A3E20

0x924EE0AB
Good God!  What a cry!
0x9C9A2DAF

0x924EE0AB
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x2444CBD6
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0xB301771D

0x924EE0AB
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0xECE7CF72
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0xE582CFF5
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x78976DD2
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0x2E36035A
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x42A7D3B5
it could repeat the effort.
0xE5D8961B

0x924EE0AB
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0x223E2E76
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0xBF9141AE
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x7F6B2402
voice shouted--
0x272C62B8

0x924EE0AB
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x945F14CC

0x924EE0AB
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x4D83ECEE
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x4B673CE2

0x924EE0AB
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0x5A4F92D7

0x924EE0AB
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0x64245406
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0xFBD48DAD
was silence.
0x56CD2A78

0x924EE0AB
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0xD26EE4A4
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x1CDA71CE
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x2F9DD878
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x6B9E4BC9
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x7957FD92
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0xCEC78A74
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x2D688FB0
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x440ACAA5
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x7E8CC1A6
confusion was inextricable.
0xAB8CF9A5

0x924EE0AB
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x062BDA0D
in his bed."
0xE07AB9D7

0x924EE0AB
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xC3DF295E
coming."
0x50AC99D2

0x924EE0AB
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0xDE463A34
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0x2890EA9C
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x70FF8655

0x924EE0AB
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0xC16C1BCE
worst at once!"
0x1666CB86

0x924EE0AB
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x0F488EDE
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xA93A82D4
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0x675D18F7

0x924EE0AB
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0xDF445B9B
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x1EC540AA

0x924EE0AB
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xEBC19879
by an effort, he added--
0xD8D7DFD0

0x924EE0AB
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0xEE46FC8B
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0xDEB6EA6B
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x17247847
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0xB5E1B6D8
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0xD992D96D
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x3CF75A8C
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x93D01D95
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x35D1C825
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0xE0E4F38E

0x924EE0AB
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x61991A59
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x53CC00FB
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x24372516
had left it.
0x82D64EAF

0x924EE0AB
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x65339410
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x160B0B30
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x0CC43C40
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0xCCBCDD28
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0x0575B3B4
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0xFE3FC793
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x48BF2362
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x51F4C706
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x7057B5E3
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x0F9F6DA3

0x924EE0AB
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x12D009F7
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x27EE9B36
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0xED210CE7
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x59901CB7
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x02F0F19F
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x8222C1BD
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0xB45BCB68

0x924EE0AB
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x896A2CD8

0x924EE0AB
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0xA663A93B

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And dressed?"
0x82CAFEB1

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x432CBE3B

0x924EE0AB
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0xD0F40755

0x924EE0AB
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x7A3AB306
noise."
0x77020C07

0x924EE0AB
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x433377C8
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x78300A0C
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x6CDE7AD0
side.
0x4C2862D1

0x924EE0AB
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0xE2EC2BE8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x1E1B9177

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Go back and fetch both."
0x7A32914C

0x924EE0AB
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0xDDF3C241
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0xFB95A193
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x5F44B5A8
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xC0870B44

0x924EE0AB
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x6D82AD11

0x924EE0AB
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0xA0009179

0x924EE0AB
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x028CB708

0x924EE0AB
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0xD53912CA
fit."
0x6CD3E083

0x924EE0AB
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x5D12398F
the key and opened the door.
0xCC1E9EC6

0x924EE0AB
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0xACD7ADF8
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0xC0F012CA
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0xE1D005AD
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x15C0FD17
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0xE35A9B7C
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0xB3E0412E
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x71E9AA27
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x49D8316D
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0x2DF3862D
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0xFB933E63
came out and closed the door behind him.
0x41D8979E

0x924EE0AB
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x32910E91
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0xE4F7A0BC
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x8F56247D
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0xCD90C069
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x39E07520
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0x9414894C
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x0F156E90
blood.
0xF3C7E7A1

0x924EE0AB
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x8352B926
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0xAF9064FD
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0x09AFFAA6
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0x80E7A2ED
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x5D972963
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xC709F46B
blood, trickling fast down.
0x5BA2E06F

0x924EE0AB
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0xB020F9CA

0x924EE0AB
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xA8D7199D
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0xB26E41D3
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0x6E8FFE03

0x924EE0AB
"Sir?"
0xF1D868FC

0x924EE0AB
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x44D36FAD
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x9664F9EB
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x828CA776
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0xA6573FE9
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0xEF416396
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x5EA09D66
consequences."
0xE5A4ACE5

0x924EE0AB
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x175600B7
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0x850ACAA7
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0xBD20B91F
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0xDD5C7E65
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x046F56DE
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0xAB9C3B60
step ceased to be heard.
0x0941D4F1

0x924EE0AB
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xF555676B
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x4C7FCDFC
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0xA93497EE
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x80E02CA6
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x05A3BD09

0x924EE0AB
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x71164FC4
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x19243FF3
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xD620F773
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x83812330
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0xECC3304A
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0x7E97B085
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0xB23AED0E
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0xD53B05BE
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x2C5991CE
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x5B80FB2C
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x4B57A32E
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x4B9DAA88

0x924EE0AB
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0xBD949248
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0xC8B6C111
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0xFF6B5C69
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0xFFBF0AF8
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0xB04A46F4
subordinate's form.
0xB25E73D7

0x924EE0AB
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0xA3E6DD89
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x9A0DE173
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0xA7BFA3A6
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0x1A5B849B
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0xD244B1F4

0x924EE0AB
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x664A65FF
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x6915CBDB
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x2E387E6E
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x43B435D1
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x13B05308
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0x2A3F098A

0x924EE0AB
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0x2963B8BC
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0xAF92774F
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0xF492C11E
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0xF3F93808
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0xD2AAB12B
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xF591375A
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xB206661B
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x82A96AC6
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0xFC4CF795
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xE73249C7
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x8D390A6E
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0xAB7BEC28
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0xBE3D5166
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x97DC8B93
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0x83A35F2C
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0xA6CCA03A
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x684E83B4
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x0F8F3585
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0xBC99D597

0x924EE0AB
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0xE3481734
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x18A75BBE
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x16730D68
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0x1D36E4FA
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x70510866

0x924EE0AB
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0xE4C97226
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x0BAFBC48
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x38E62869
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0x8A5BE05C
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0x16459C6F
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x9D401AA6
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0x895E87BA
I might not even speak to him.
0x6C7E29C1

0x924EE0AB
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x2DAD4071
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xD5ACD57A
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0xA519CE88
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0xB075B449
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0x39B8D886
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0xF01F0B4D
shorter.
0xE0F6142C

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0x580A94FC

0x924EE0AB
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0x29B18172
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x093A02B1
patient downstairs and all."
0xD929FFF1

0x924EE0AB
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0xC88B1DBD

0x924EE0AB
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x8651B27A
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0xFC35E83A

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x73472B11
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x83CD3A65
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x12E4AABA
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x88433A92

0x924EE0AB
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x4D66E348

0x924EE0AB
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xF6E10977

0x924EE0AB
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x4C67F322
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0xB28C705D
there's no danger."
0xDA28C060

0x924EE0AB
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x90347484
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0x9545AA6D
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0xDA3AC7EB
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x88A34B76
here!"
0x34E82247

0x924EE0AB
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0xB127280D
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x65498ABA

0x924EE0AB
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x41325F0B
said Mr. Rochester.
0x50D96449

0x924EE0AB
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x6CC7C4D3
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0x1B9972E9
looked so quiet at first."
0x74A8E900

0x924EE0AB
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x8BDD6A84
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x576BED98
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x07FAD0F3
alone."
0x62CB6044

0x924EE0AB
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xFEF818B2

0x924EE0AB
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0xF1D8D922
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0xBA7B591B
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0xD7218649
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0x6B7F9890

0x924EE0AB
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x56FC5A74
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x441A4C71

0x924EE0AB
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x032F44AF

0x924EE0AB
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0xCA03E6DF
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0xE0BB105C
said--
0x7AD3EC29

0x924EE0AB
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x07870477
it."
0xB1E16654

0x924EE0AB
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x2A2123D6

0x924EE0AB
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x8F1445B2
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0xD1ABCC97
think of her at all."
0xF15908FD

0x924EE0AB
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xBB5F155B

0x924EE0AB
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xD4F81105
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0xAB889B06
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0xF307703E
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xE65A8E15
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x8CA6DB75
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0xB29D6309
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x7F5DA3A9

0x924EE0AB
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x512BC21C
and returned with them.
0x263BD515

0x924EE0AB
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0x55476CAD
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0xC1CF514F

0x924EE0AB
I retired as directed.
0xC44CB303

0x924EE0AB
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x7EC7C5E6
Rochester presently.
0x78D627C3

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x3573E4B9

0x924EE0AB
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x7F0BCEBB
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x966E6372
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x29026AD1
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xC8FA9984
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x679EF39B
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xB4189DE1
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x20DF49E2

0x924EE0AB
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x8BF6C0D2
edged with fur.
0x4510201F

0x924EE0AB
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0x9BE3439F
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x7E680258
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xE905AD25
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0xAEE37214
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xD3D42FEA

0x924EE0AB
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0xEE2AB565

0x924EE0AB
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0xEB3B67FF
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x9899FFDB
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x9633B687
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xD23911D4
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xB1B734B8

0x924EE0AB
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x7C8A2C31
the washstand.
0xDB4F0BA2

0x924EE0AB
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0x73290F7B

0x924EE0AB
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x7D6A37F7
to Mason.
0x504CC2DB

0x924EE0AB
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x32A545AC

0x924EE0AB
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0x850D7B3E

0x924EE0AB
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0xACF7E2FD

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0x76A7EF84
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0xEB02E146
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xDB59106F
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x2BADC66A

0x924EE0AB
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x0ED64EC2

0x924EE0AB
The patient rose.
0x2370BCAC

0x924EE0AB
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x17B3B16E
step out--that's it!"
0xCCBA4F37

0x924EE0AB
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x1DFF6DEF

0x924EE0AB
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0x16D1E4A2
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x58704EB9
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0xFD433632
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x5AAA2656
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0xD27AAA08

0x924EE0AB
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x20979F7A
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0xEE84880A
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0xA7B4B85F
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x9DB6C076
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x8AB93359
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0x33BC677C
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x02CD031E
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0xB7B4C527
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0x0FF0E3CC
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x712A4516
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x24B1D3C1
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0xBE80F7D9

0x924EE0AB
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0xE72D54F2
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xF8F752BA
chaise; Carter followed.
0xA9AD8D6F

0x924EE0AB
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0xCD4364B2
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0xB7A13078
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x3BB9B7B4

0x924EE0AB
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0xB81CD63A

0x924EE0AB
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x46EA404D
Dick."
0xF528898A

0x924EE0AB
"Fairfax--"
0x0F8B28E3

0x924EE0AB
"Well what is it?"
0x88FFDB9B

0x924EE0AB
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x1292D83C
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xEE55D0BA

0x924EE0AB
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x51F66B9A
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x6EB2DF9A

0x924EE0AB
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x20C9B72C
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0x300604DC

0x924EE0AB
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xD23347FE
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x06541421
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0x26CD6983
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x59690778

0x924EE0AB
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x2D267B26
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0xB5932DB2

0x924EE0AB
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0xFCED9462

0x924EE0AB
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0x6D520109
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0xC9DF0CAD
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x0AC8FC16
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xC6CCAC80
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x76D9916C
pure."
0xFA089FF6

0x924EE0AB
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0xAA1D1442
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0xABE2B720
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x4ED2A7FC
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x96370804
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x31D4CD97
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0xF197D7DD
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0xC085631A
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x253DAC9F

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x64006039

0x924EE0AB
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0x57E75259
me.
0x23A34F09

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you, sir."
0x9D0E3ADD

0x924EE0AB
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x695836E3
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x3B656E19
atmosphere?"
0x6A717093

0x924EE0AB
"I do, very much."
0x4C4CFE13

0x924EE0AB
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x72CC3299

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x5CE18E2C
with Mason?"
0x3E9099AC

0x924EE0AB
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0xB01DE0FF

0x924EE0AB
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0xFD40C2B4
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x5210DA86
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0x2C51B954

0x924EE0AB
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x8C73D459

0x924EE0AB
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0x7F37E9AB
thoughts."
0x0736A7DA

0x924EE0AB
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0xE43D01CE

0x924EE0AB
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0xED142E25

0x924EE0AB
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0x7F6BB031

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xD068BBD5
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x181F46D1
spue fire any day."
0xC085A822

0x924EE0AB
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0xED01AA1A
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0xD34CFD4F
you."
0x8D4EE5F3

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0x8359F033
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0xB93A4CFE
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0x17F89BBC

0x924EE0AB
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x47C6CC13
how to avert the danger."
0xFF4E86B2

0x924EE0AB
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x912ED505
from him.
0x9F1D7A6F

0x924EE0AB
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0x8CEFCE57
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0x84AB40D5
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0x3309A2BD
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0xF4FD71B9
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x15543C27
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0x25F6AA74
friend, are you not?"
0xB490C408

0x924EE0AB
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x72A33390

0x924EE0AB
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0x40753F26
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0x1D403A11
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0x031C282F
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0x0893EA81
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0xB0C3E6E9
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x408CE943
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0x46CC22C6
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x3F84ED40
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x8BF8E638
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0xD222C7E6
me at once."
0xA709054D

0x924EE0AB
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0xF61B09FE
you are very safe."
0xB0B87CE6

0x924EE0AB
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x0E50B0C1

0x924EE0AB
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x54021409
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0x8A9A61A5
before him.
0x1E470F19

0x924EE0AB
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0xEF6589A8
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x599DE13A

0x924EE0AB
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x21518ED3

0x924EE0AB
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x8CD6A3A1
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xFDCB908D
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x8FC8E911
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x6BAB13CA
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x40487F8D
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x4401CB21

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir; I am content."
0x98BBFB17

0x924EE0AB
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xB60C41FF
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x0419E4E5
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x49931AE8
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x18F34AA4
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x3523753F
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0xCD3092A7
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xBC61B983
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0xE913665C
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xA37E5C1D
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0xA57E02FD
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x8F11921A
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0x24919829
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x7289AEED
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0xCA2BB6F8
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x2B21A500
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x3A409CAB
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0xBBDD4944
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0xE9867025
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x97235A49
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0x578192E1
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0xDFD7214A
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0xC3BA9F14
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x605AB2D6
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0x0D7B2E4E
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x5FE4FA20
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0xF0EB6DE8
judgment approves?"
0x947A3D3B

0x924EE0AB
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0xDA99DB31
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xB97E4347
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x77161A02
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0xF8B16DF2
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x3DE9706F

0x924EE0AB
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xB53F53FA

0x924EE0AB
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x5630FD36
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0xF90723FC
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0x5DD691B0
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xB1DFED50

0x924EE0AB
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0xE0F63240
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0xBCEE3FB0
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x483BBC8A
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0xC3C613CB
amend and solace to heal."
0x9BD50CA6

0x924EE0AB
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x4C11AB6B
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0xBC818A3C
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0xF0A22540
instrument for my cure in--"
0xE56ACE93

0x924EE0AB
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0x9EE7D176
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0xC9EFA596
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x7077C4E2
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0xA6A0D029
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x4E9A1DB6

0x924EE0AB
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x065555B9
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0x94A9170E
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x2A66E62A
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0x3D1D833C

0x924EE0AB
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0xADE90732
came back he was humming a tune.
0x230BE24F

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x44155AEC
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x97AB09E1

0x924EE0AB
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x7A69D30E

0x924EE0AB
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x0FB8054D
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xCDF126AD
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x949E780C

0x924EE0AB
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0x9B6C256B

0x924EE0AB
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0x8900F39E
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0xAC17F7C7
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0xE2BAE797

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x9983E957

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0xE26C8169
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x004C78BC
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0x61C72F9B

0x924EE0AB
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0x0462770B
cheerfully--
0x34ECAF91

0x924EE0AB
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0xCEEE3E56
I rose at four to see him off."
0x9A6996B3

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXI
0x8C6A8D55

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x200CA9C6
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x2DA03481
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x20BE0899
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x2CAB7797
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x66AA1784
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x7E2E2469
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0xF4561EC1
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0xF3447A59
man.
0x0B4B2D72

0x924EE0AB
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0xD8D13344
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x7C8063B5
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x703EDE91
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x5C1B640F
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0x648EB62D
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x4C63255C
little sister.
0x8F1A0C19

0x924EE0AB
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0x06DEE54D
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xF390302D
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x49479A5D
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0x9C186FBD
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0xD23C8ADA
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x866B87D7
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x83625D47
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x8155B35B
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0xEF695B2C

0x924EE0AB
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x1C9B1F76
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0xEA4848B1
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0xBBD610D5
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x8A9A171B
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0xD4B41C9E
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0x03CAB77C
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0xB2F97AD2
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0xBB90DE50
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x7A3DE1B0

0x924EE0AB
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xA3AB2FD4
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0xBD740595
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0x123AC6B5

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x2FD6F396
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x28F7D762
are married to Bessie?"
0xB6072383

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0x585A3360
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0xE2BA2A54
child are thriving."
0x13F7CED3

0x924EE0AB
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0x03545C11

0x924EE0AB
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x264356C3
badly at present--in great trouble."
0xADB273FA

0x924EE0AB
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x5E96224B
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x54C7192A

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xCB3FACCF

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. John?"
0x5ED3FBBC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x21534E43

0x924EE0AB
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x58E3D48C
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x9EAED879
his death was shocking."
0x6BAC1664

0x924EE0AB
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0xCD4B02F3

0x924EE0AB
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x998B81B8
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x0AF242C5
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x6DB41A36
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0xC417D438
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x4EAD7746
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0xFD165510
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0xB6854F4B
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x17694D39
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0xD5CDA2A0

0x924EE0AB
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x19F15244

0x924EE0AB
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x56EC7BBA
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x0C3BA880
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x21F8C90A
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0xA9042CA8
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x24879EFA
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0xEA70DD61
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x81423DE9
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0x9C3F2CCE
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x208D2F0E
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0xB2BF14CC
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0xE581CBA0
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x1E864114
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0xE927CBC5
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0xC93985DC
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x2689C291
morning."
0x2E6A6730

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xA4F6B716

0x924EE0AB
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0xA397CCE7
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0xEC7582B3

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x117ADEA5
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x951D7F86
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0x77C2281F

0x924EE0AB
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0xC487E24A
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x64E95EE6
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0xBC8E9597
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0x90EAA1DF
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x0AFA48E6
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x05847016
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xA89A7FD8
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xA800DE51
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x342D98C7
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x8AAD21A4
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0x029BB7A0
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xBEC84FD5
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0xDB05CF01
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xABD42253
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0x4FEDFAB1
lineaments.
0x268FF269

0x924EE0AB
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x9C0ED5B3
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x2DFE19DA
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xC8C0185C
cue and followed me from the room.
0xA8F9E3C9

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xD9997DEB
which he had shut.
0x9C505C7B

0x924EE0AB
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0xF72632C6

0x924EE0AB
"What to do?--where to go?"
0x7631CE22

0x924EE0AB
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0xBC0D7542

0x924EE0AB
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x45DC82A9

0x924EE0AB
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x6347F9F7

0x924EE0AB
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0x28EA16B3
people to see her that distance?"
0xBB39AFBE

0x924EE0AB
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0xBEDBB497

0x924EE0AB
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0xA015E3CD

0x924EE0AB
"It is his widow, sir."
0x0DF676DA

0x924EE0AB
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x91C37814

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0xD9C80A68

0x924EE0AB
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x4FD84857
had no relations."
0xCFCD52B6

0x924EE0AB
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0x29C17F99
off."
0x5BC7E877

0x924EE0AB
"Why?"
0x1DD0B2F4

0x924EE0AB
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x5AA6E72D

0x924EE0AB
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0xA0E8CED6
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0xC17936BE
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0xB851DDDB
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0xAD7021FF
in London."
0xD94BCFED

0x924EE0AB
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x422BB4F2
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0x70460DA4
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0x86321EF7

0x924EE0AB
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0xB1906D9C
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0x69BD0FE6
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0xCE58686F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0x661FCCE3
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0x430CAE08

0x924EE0AB
"How long will you stay?"
0x0DF8A6B6

0x924EE0AB
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0xC75DB2D0

0x924EE0AB
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0x26595A47

0x924EE0AB
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0x6CA3E0C0

0x924EE0AB
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0xD94531A5
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0xC59ED73F

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0xEC558C6D

0x924EE0AB
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x44439966

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x90BC27BB

0x924EE0AB
"A person to be trusted?"
0xADAC51BB

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0xF4E0F93E

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0x86AC6A55

0x924EE0AB
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x2FB0487F

0x924EE0AB
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0xA02E4807
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0xEBF5631F
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0xF76749A4

0x924EE0AB
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x8B429270
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x8FB7A32C
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0x745F9178
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0x11849603
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0xF6BD4042

0x924EE0AB
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0xE5B4F8F6

0x924EE0AB
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x9A15B731
if recollecting something, he said--
0xAA252A45

0x924EE0AB
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0x55DB797F
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0x643A7594
plenty?"
0xC06BDE3A

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0x00B5D373

0x924EE0AB
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0x9D3A4FC4

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0x8723566A
while I have the opportunity."
0x2B39BA70

0x924EE0AB
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x05C911F2

0x924EE0AB
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0x0FC6534F
married?"
0x08A968D6

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; what then?"
0x78934B47

0x924EE0AB
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0xF974DAD5
perceive the necessity of it."
0x82F355DF

0x924EE0AB
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x1259A053
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0xD508F45C
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0x89FF875D
straight to--the devil?"
0x52AA7BB1

0x924EE0AB
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0x03F2B88C

0x924EE0AB
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0x7478D952
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0x67B8136B

0x924EE0AB
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0x453C5B48
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0x42502D3F

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0xE713D9C1
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0xAB5A81B1

0x924EE0AB
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0x094E3920
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0x01A34DF7
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x4E336856

0x924EE0AB
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0x28E2B77D
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0xFA87E800

0x924EE0AB
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0x4749CDF5
five pounds, Jane."
0x58060BEC

0x924EE0AB
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0xA517C4CF

0x924EE0AB
"Just let me look at the cash."
0xFD3CA53F

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0x15E7F140

0x924EE0AB
"Jane!"
0x331CD95B

0x924EE0AB
"Sir?"
0xF1D868FC

0x924EE0AB
"Promise me one thing."
0x34567460

0x924EE0AB
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0x2B7D4425

0x924EE0AB
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0xC021D5B6
find you one in time."
0x956BC0E0

0x924EE0AB
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0x12F79DCC
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0xD74EFBA1
it."
0xB1E16654

0x924EE0AB
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0xB26B7321
then?"
0x927FC189

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir; early."
0xB29B0C38

0x924EE0AB
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0x8C3D690B

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0xF37BE45B

0x924EE0AB
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0x5034ABEC

0x924EE0AB
"I suppose so, sir."
0xA81EB7C0

0x924EE0AB
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0x65FF4EB0
not quite up to it."
0x2C029B94

0x924EE0AB
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0x5963C556

0x924EE0AB
"Then say it."
0xB146CFC4

0x924EE0AB
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x6F2EF8F5

0x924EE0AB
"What must I say?"
0x833EB3A3

0x924EE0AB
"The same, if you like, sir."
0x0624821E

0x924EE0AB
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0xB1C0D768

0x924EE0AB
"Yes?"
0x0818C297

0x924EE0AB
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0x2480530B
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x7B979CF3
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0xD0C66C73
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0x8204FE7F

0x924EE0AB
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0xF4C1EB1B
as in many."
0xED156DF6

0x924EE0AB
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0xF7EB893D

0x924EE0AB
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x70F98C18
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xA3BF90B5
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0xE442A027
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x1E8E54D2

0x924EE0AB
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0xB6C492F8
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x16233D45
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0xEE9709A8
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0x07E49EA7
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xFFA42D46
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x35D016BD

0x924EE0AB
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0xC6050204

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0xA8A849BF
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x53AF38EC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0x95A70B19
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x4BFAC86C
will finally recover."
0xCEF6B4CF

0x924EE0AB
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0xA500A7FC

0x924EE0AB
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x2B2D8865
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x97C690ED
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0xF403C81F
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0xB9A82E67
and then I will go up with you?"
0x2491DA72

0x924EE0AB
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x76B953A6
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0xB76432DE
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x185C40F5
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0xE5581BF2
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x2B333E99

0x924EE0AB
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0xF413D617
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x1FC48FFC
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x3E52AD88
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x16C97A73
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0x95BAB339
looks.
0xA163FBCB

0x924EE0AB
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x6ED3BDDE
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x6428C699
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0xB8517500
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xD36C452B
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x53554152
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0xFFA75FB1

0x924EE0AB
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0xA2270712
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x1CF7CDB2
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0xD56E2D8C
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x394F4AF5
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x50E10789
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x15E4A79D
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x17492D7F

0x924EE0AB
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x61794CC3
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x4B72F4CA
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x6FB3C273
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0xD744570E
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x4B55DC39
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x7361F3B9
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x6075AA88
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x480FCC2F
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0x14CF127C
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0xB7EFDB52
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xD6C0C5BB
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0x3B276CC4

0x924EE0AB
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0xCB377D40
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x63B7FFC1

0x924EE0AB
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x8F62726A
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0x8C6D293F
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x18CBB3E3
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x62C300C7
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0xA51D3EED
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x535F930A
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0xCBA29C18
past recognition.
0x2E35640D

0x924EE0AB
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0x6C079D9C
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0xE1D56CC7
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0x9DB219FF
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x19C0B375
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0x83EA3973
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xA21A1C80
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x0DA4ECE0
colourless visage.
0xA88F49AF

0x924EE0AB
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x61661301
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x4350988B
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0xD7B5E435
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0xD512570B
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0x40680B20
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x0EA77C06
other's looked puritanical.
0xFD8A257D

0x924EE0AB
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xD4B478EF
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xFCF286A2
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0xBB6581AA
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0xAB2E45A6
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0xE667FA63

0x924EE0AB
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0xED108E1B
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x88F16374
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x2433244F
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xEB3B3AE9
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0xEACD87A9
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x6FDA75D0
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xCC838D68
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x6B5B1CC3
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0x2882DFBD
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0xEC7F8BCE
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xB8C87640
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0xF851C61B
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0x312D5300

0x924EE0AB
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x77170E71
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x74E521DA
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x0FF09EB7
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0xDE37DCA2
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x01D7D1BF
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0xC774A4DD
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0xA390B50A
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x53B95560
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x8246DF7B

0x924EE0AB
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x6DF628B8
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x06611847
liberty.
0xC35FFB90

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0xB7DE4124
can see her to-night."
0xD6D94518

0x924EE0AB
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x0E74EDEB
should be much obliged to you."
0xA5E6A84F

0x924EE0AB
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0xC11290A1
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x82D66D53
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x507D591F

0x924EE0AB
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xE7BFAAC7
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x0D2342CD
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0xF56577FD
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x963F326F
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0x42EB88DA
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x5D062BE4
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x60AA9A85
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0xE90DCC53
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x320D98A0
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0xD959A8D9
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x336EC7CA
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0xB7A977EB
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x9184F4EA
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x46D12A59
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x3FCEC082

0x924EE0AB
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x7839E0B0
us see if she will know you."
0x8661AC31

0x924EE0AB
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0xEAEB868A
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x0EA9B753
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x88B36D4C
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x165AE2AA
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x2A1E2872
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x334D440B
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x5E65C383
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0xD1B9C447
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0xAA96D9ED
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x169AD821
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xDD122D16

0x924EE0AB
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0xEBDC7A4C
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x77B17083
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0x3DC17735
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0xD6856B00
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0xA7E5703B
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0xDFBB2992
amity.
0xCC39B0BB

0x924EE0AB
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0xB7730D12
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x85EB1AF0
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x52DD2959
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x53C18A6D
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x277321ED
she looked at me.
0xE728F45F

0x924EE0AB
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x3B9B4DA9

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0x553D9A6B

0x924EE0AB
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x75354E3C
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xDC86A023
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x89B017CF
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x42904171
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0xB617A563
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x0B05AAAD
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x75E983B0
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0xA3A4D1D0
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x07D90821
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0xA3D7DBD3
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x65DB0D60
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0xABAB8172

0x924EE0AB
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0x71E8B146
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x1CB225E4
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0xA03412E0
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x83DD015F
the pillow.
0xEE54C263

0x924EE0AB
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xD6606BFE
till I see how you get on."
0xB7FE2250

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x359638EF

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0x89EEAFDA
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0xBD46B7A9
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x89229B58
say--let me see--"
0x26AE3EBC

0x924EE0AB
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x0B955801
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x8911DBD0
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0xBC615902
was at once irritated.
0xF2AB6D8B

0x924EE0AB
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0xBB8C96AC
you Jane Eyre?"
0x7DAFF9EB

0x924EE0AB
"I am Jane Eyre."
0xF128C5D6

0x924EE0AB
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0xFB5E25A7
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x8F624C6C
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x451E7F97
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xDA8F07BC
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0xCFF0D7E2
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0xD1B56EBD
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x42318E56
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x7B289EA5
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0xEB5B020A

0x924EE0AB
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0xF1DD4B37

0x924EE0AB
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0x75DA2FCF
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x3E1B4E18
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0xD7B6638A
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x0C92CC46
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x93741C50
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0xB453C2F1
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x71632FAA
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0xF10483AF
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x0655470C
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x2D364F5A
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0xFD18C8C1
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x173E3968
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0xA69A4947
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x798E054D
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0xB21D705C
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xF9568922
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0x751F7A1E
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xA2FA1113
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0x35C2EBEC
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x901C545E
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x846A088C
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0xCEE97EAE
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xBAFC75AE
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x70370CB4

0x924EE0AB
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0xA3A4E8FF
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x942F30A2

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x450466DA
the morning she is calmer."
0x526086D4

0x924EE0AB
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xF6C0DD47
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x3037341C
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x7FEAA0D5
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0xA861CD63
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x9D4BF74E
had?"
0xF335466D

0x924EE0AB
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x3615E89D
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0xC4FC8C80
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0xBBF1A41F

0x924EE0AB
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0xB2D98229
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0x7E6CF242
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0xD40C8B7A
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x39E5083A
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xD5F85A42
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0x5132BF28
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x2BA797CB
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x129347ED
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0x5E611AEE
for both.
0xC2D08336

0x924EE0AB
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0x94BBC8D8
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x4A304F0A
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x056D3327
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x694B0AB8
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0x1646EAF3
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0xD8A8F397
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x33471A81
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0x426238AE

0x924EE0AB
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0xA2DA77A2
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x0E44ABFB
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x2F0BC32D
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0x829B45DE
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0xB64AAC67
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x7AA23BF3
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x2645472B
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x51856D46
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0xC4985BB1
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0xA8BFECC4
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x68D34020
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0xD36986BF
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xDD6E1E65
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x7D905279
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0xF69CB26A
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xB159F230
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0xC22039B1
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x2ED72B4C
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0xBD380354
and content.
0x5D565509

0x924EE0AB
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0xFE33BAB2
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0x4692F96D
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x39B3B932
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0xD3D3DDCF
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0xC04104A9
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x277C83D9
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x5673238E
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xAFAC4C78
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0xFC2F7C92
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x6524F889
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0xB1744927
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xDD7CEC0C
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0x413AFE53
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0xEA7706C1
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0xCF6BF745
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0xEA680415
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0xD5022A6D
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xB81B29E6
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0xF2A20E39
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x3AD68112
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x74663C85
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0xF16BB2D3
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xBA981DD2
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0xEB602278
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x77E3F54C

0x924EE0AB
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x33899D78
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x87A6A4F3
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0x299D05CB
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x1035AA0C
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0x9F2CE3F4
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x78D5633A
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x8F22C954
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0x7F8C3F44
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x7F992FDC
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x056336A6
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0x82F3D378
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x76776E5E
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x2BD2F011
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x11CC2031
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0xDD40844A
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0xBD821B0F
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x115584A6
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x212F5DF7

0x924EE0AB
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x1A292F8A
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0xAE736ECC
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0xBD92BE67
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x44A60362
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x98B1E12E
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0xC142385C
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x8D0198C5
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x9A84A653
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x3959FDA0
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x9FAA434B

0x924EE0AB
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x4274DB33
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0x31D3D823
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x9318E01C

0x924EE0AB
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x74074938
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xC6898082
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x90D89A7A
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x8C7D0846
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x0AED8BE9
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0x99645AD5
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0xDBC1BEC5
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x7D07DD8E
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0x9D21066B
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x720FFC42
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x6EAE2564

0x924EE0AB
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x53E79DDD
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x1B9DD964
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x41AFE5EB
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x692DE89C
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x6BD51814
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x51C765A8
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x3236116E
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x03DA4FE7
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0x8C8821EE
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x9A21DBD9
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0x450632F9
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x6182DB3C
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x4FDB0222
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x99A17546
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0xFFD0414C
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0xC6661ACF
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0x7354960A
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x8AE4CF62
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0xD3BB20E7
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x6A4D46BF
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0x7738514C
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x4ECAE5B8
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0x9ADD9E40
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0xF283102A
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0xA8A37E15
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0x53A19D1B
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x54A63570
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0xD990FA48
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0x49E9CA32
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0xB2E12984
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0x85F97DB5
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x4FCEA632

0x924EE0AB
She closed her lips.
0x15BE9543

0x924EE0AB
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x39DD6695
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0x79ECB535
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x7DE98939
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0x70D39927
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x59562BA2
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x282FCA68
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0xD99226ED
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x002BB397
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0x423ABFC6

0x924EE0AB
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0xDF53C739
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x12D24953
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xC9BEC032
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x5FD259A0
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x100A8FFE

0x924EE0AB
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x7B1476D3
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0xA170BF35
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x5AB5FFE3
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x09FA3108
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x29B2DB2F
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x6595648D

0x924EE0AB
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x0209AEB2
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0xAE0A3819
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x023394EB
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x3C664445
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x8C305126
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x4BA808BC
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x0945E3CD
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x1E4B4CF6
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x969A84D7
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x42CB5139

0x924EE0AB
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0x97699FB6
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x458C4745
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0xBB7ACA1A
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x9FA65DA9

0x924EE0AB
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x33490E41
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xC5C9EA21
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x9862800B
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x5FB74158
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x2D8B30F6
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x8CDF272F
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0xA46DC27A

0x924EE0AB
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x49EDFAC7
her.
0xEEF4379D

0x924EE0AB
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0xEEB8EC8D

0x924EE0AB
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0xBB401092
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x700E3C88
me--where is Bessie?"
0xFB5E36A5

0x924EE0AB
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x6EE673BF

0x924EE0AB
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0x94F77240
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x3053E61C
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x36FAE3BF

0x924EE0AB
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xB84228F6
identity.
0x4C6A35B4

0x924EE0AB
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x097A4B79
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0xEB9EEFB5
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0xF703173A
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x54C303D1
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0x9D384458
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0x3AE07296

0x924EE0AB
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x5E6D3C6C
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0x459345A9
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x2A67C2D9
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0xE5112D25
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0xABDC78F1

0x924EE0AB
I assured her we were alone.
0x049DFF7D

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xAFA0AADE
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x774D645E
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x0413028B
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0xCE6DDA09
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x5D7BB8A7

0x924EE0AB
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xD98CFB5B
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x93890480
of the last pang.
0x48BF516F

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0xE9DA647B
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0xE9DBF883
there."
0xB042A738

0x924EE0AB
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0x6E2FA8AF

0x924EE0AB
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xF1A0FF30

0x924EE0AB
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0xD04A0F8B
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x78976BE8
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0x3FCC7229
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x0BBB9038
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0xFB1AB053
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x6EA6365A

0x924EE0AB
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x1690D6A3

0x924EE0AB
It was dated three years back.
0x028CEFA2

0x924EE0AB
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x0EF26BC2

0x924EE0AB
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x0EF82E82
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0xBB0B40F3
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x150F7D4E
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0xA9AAC460
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x0A103764
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x4A048737
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x6FE6616C
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x17A48913
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0xC6CAEA26
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x6EAA84D2

0x924EE0AB
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0x8AF13EB8
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x757280F8
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x4A65A0BA
passed since that day."
0xE3105B54

0x924EE0AB
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0x6ACF8A4F
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x1BF3C18C

0x924EE0AB
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x070FBC19
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x18C9784F
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x9CA57A1A
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x3AE31E54
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x4A1F08CD
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x70D1ECD9
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0x4C753AF2
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0xDDC427F5

0x924EE0AB
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0x5AE4C9B9
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0xC6CBB2CE

0x924EE0AB
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0x35800969
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xD06FC874
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0xE11DBB1B
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x2ACEDD90

0x924EE0AB
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x4548F74B
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0xC137ECFD
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0x05B44286
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x16066C3D

0x924EE0AB
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x809E22CA
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x6DEDCBAB
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0xB9079CB1
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x9BDB60F2
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x1DAE337A

0x924EE0AB
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x906FFA56
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0xFDFA0DE0

0x924EE0AB
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x173625D7
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x0330281A
she must hate me still.
0xE145C804

0x924EE0AB
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x661881EB
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0x64226D8F
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0x90DB8007
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x976979A5
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0x36DB3924
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0xFC2B4733
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0xBBDE6ECA
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xD07E480C
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0xF9732B5C
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0xBB9A81A1
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xAD047BCC
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x1D7C208D
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x487E0FD6
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x5AF09C32
form.
0xE071ACF6

0x924EE0AB
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x39D617AD
observed--
0x69926CA8

0x924EE0AB
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0xE3A43031
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0xFE356BB4
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x66B44E86
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0xD1D15D74

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x499173EE
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x940411BF
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x8EDA4C32
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x2C35DF21
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x6AE177ED
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x64161A55
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0xAA0C268D
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x6BEEDF8E
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x3698A87E
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x2BFEF17B
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x6245C96D
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x5C9F22C3
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0x57DEF8F0
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x7E5A8838
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x49D15993
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x78E97DF7
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0x118068EA
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0xEB771A6E
patient and compliant on my part."
0xB6B1D654

0x924EE0AB
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x4A95F25B
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x4AEC2060
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0x17DCAB5C
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x79C2FEC6
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x52E17749
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0xCC9E97E0
notes of condolence.
0xC9784C09

0x924EE0AB
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0x33C1F0BC
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x4C21E1AF
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xA3711CF1
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0xA7116FFA
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0xAFF608BB
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x0FE25176
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x352C338E
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x60B047C8
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0xC2EC0526
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xC8B94F5E
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x4833E159
veil."
0x9325A93E

0x924EE0AB
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0xDB668F00
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x80DFC300
good may it do you!"
0x0336B967

0x924EE0AB
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x8733F093
you have some sense."
0x0069AAD3

0x924EE0AB
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x6BD249D9
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x88353489
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xF42D252D
much care."
0xD8EA0704

0x924EE0AB
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x7906DF73
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0xE90DAE45
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xB593379E
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x547A2473
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x2F782E58
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0xB4029900
fortune.
0x73E7D8B1

0x924EE0AB
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x3222452D
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x7BD8C914
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0xF1668F8D
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x524ECAD9
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0x6A386F09
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0xB5F5B3A6
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x0F5C8C29
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x4F9E1189
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0x20DEDCAF

0x924EE0AB
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0x2C63527B
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x3884292E
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x0CE6460F
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0xD9274797
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0xF3E46002
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x0399A8BA
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0xE9B933C4
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x8FC90919
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x92224755
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0xAEA25BE7
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xFF93C935
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0xC73ECB90

0x924EE0AB
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xF5FF9BF1
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0xB3C40440
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0x42816F21
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x661BBC3C
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0xBCDBE822
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0xA21D3651
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0x6A1C8F87
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x7BC594F5
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x0ADFF42A
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0xB705BDC2
don't doubt it."
0xF50241EE

0x924EE0AB
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0xE33FA938
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0x53FCE547
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0x04E05CD2
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xEA153155
both her and me.
0xD859EEC5

0x924EE0AB
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xEF4B46F0
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0xB86E44A7
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x9FFD96C3
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0x9BBFD178
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0xC215EE36
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0xDBDFFD60

0x924EE0AB
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xFB48D4A7
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0xC2A86404
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x637010E0
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x74C327FC
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0xF88843D1
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x8E873CAB
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0x09A9F329

0x924EE0AB
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x12268920
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x05434132
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x5906C5C0
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0x2EC2287B
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xC337CBAB
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x6109A909
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x656BBEE7

0x924EE0AB
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x1276F9C7
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x2B35ADB9
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xCFA54B78
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x57511A85
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xCC53B298
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0xDE095DB8
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xC8CEDE30

0x924EE0AB
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x07BA43A7
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0xEF6229C3
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0xAF696E8A
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x6BEA4ACA
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0xEC0C76B3
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0x7EEB74F3
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0xD51925EA
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x23FA8178

0x924EE0AB
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x86DBC760
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x28773CAC
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x22195826
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0xA953488B
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xA90B3030
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x82FC7863

0x924EE0AB
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0xA5217B6A
are!  Come on, if you please."
0x9D74479F

0x924EE0AB
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x8EDE7C29
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x7D218D19
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0xD57CC698
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0xD2670EF7
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x6E5EB124
behave with decent composure.
0x64FF03DE

0x924EE0AB
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0x507E10C1
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0xAEF12C56
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x45B32844
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0xE667CE23
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x3D15ECDB
month?"
0x928F296F

0x924EE0AB
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0xEDC38EB9

0x924EE0AB
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0xB37B149A
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0xFA88D442
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x808DE68E
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0xD323CB90
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0x6131C5CB
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x4F1D0B96
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x2BAA3552

0x924EE0AB
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x6E0C4B0A
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0xCF90467B
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x15DD773A
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0xF6DE607A
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x70F94E63
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0xB6547B1E
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0x105E2BB0
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x0BB659C3
that it were my home!
0xA6E53507

0x924EE0AB
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x5BC48C20
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xAEBE8499

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0xE5558986

0x924EE0AB
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x92980730

0x924EE0AB
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xA4DB9A5E

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x28F5E56B

0x924EE0AB
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x90B2E72E
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0xECBD1466
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x4320C3C7
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xF03ED64D
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0xCCE065DF
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x02ED1C4A

0x924EE0AB
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0xA6762659
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x083FD1B7
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x7BA3E64E

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x0A706A0F
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x79B995CF
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0xDFFCE2B3
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0xF31C41E3
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0xA06FDB68
shed it over me now.
0xA5EE1303

0x924EE0AB
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0xE561D4B6
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x9BF1204D

0x924EE0AB
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x409572C5
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0x16113E40
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0xFBAB5403
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0x79916DB5

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0xACE59F04
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0x643D6F69

0x924EE0AB
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x8AA299EF
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x2A2B3D6A
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x5FDFF877
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x04275082
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0x3436978F
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x0E976657

0x924EE0AB
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x0EC65465
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x7AB80FD3
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0xA1A96CC7
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0x0E232E09
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0xB282859A
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0xBD26CC52
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x641681EB
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x7FC8E122
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0xF77EE2C2
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0xB73A4366
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0xC0C35DDD
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x9B2D9CF9
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0xBC87447C
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x761CF7B3

0x924EE0AB
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x3620219B
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x338A8F9E
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xC00AC54C
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x61BC4A9A
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x5250B930
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0x77FCE1A1
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xF4CE936B

0x924EE0AB
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x9F3E341A
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0xFD084877
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0x37EDF162
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0xE713C2E2
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x4D87785A
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0xA5C4882A
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0xE445A4BD
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x983CDA15
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0xD25A3BA9
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0xF883FE64
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0xAE7D31AC
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xA066BD39
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

CHAPTER XXIII
0x9EC97147

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x38DBDE69
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x6D9CB837
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x4EC6CE99
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0xA6EEC14D
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x4978F203
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x258CB3EE
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x7F8240FD
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x41352440

0x924EE0AB
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x1DD00037
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xBC618744
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0xF9581DAF

0x924EE0AB
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x3BA09F53
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x1AF950A6
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x30417743
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x2FD17D14
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0x01396A43
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x954B56B5
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xB7D2AEF2
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xA562EF87

0x924EE0AB
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x8A76C952
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x43EEEC43
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0x62182231
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0xC5A7753F
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x429B9646
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0xBBFF4312
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x92DFAC5C
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x2E26269D
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0x8CC1BFA2
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x6DAA5441
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x21A76DB0
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x866149E9
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0x6B1CD72C
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x7C6C0C66
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0xED9F57C3

0x924EE0AB
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x5B049FC2
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0xE398EF38
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0xA9F544F3
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0xC523F95D
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x20F19DA3
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x21B00A4F
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0xC18F3C55
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x35558ADA
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0xC4FB428B

0x924EE0AB
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x49A38B22
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xCE4C075C
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x499D6A90
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xB4FCE248
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xDA67115E
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0xCECCD9DD
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0x3774C46B

0x924EE0AB
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0xCDA41AB6
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0xD079DDDF

0x924EE0AB
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xEA29C6BE
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xFC4475C8
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x7953FF07
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0x50C2B19A
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x3BB79404
turning--
0xA8D5E08D

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0xF0C8455F

0x924EE0AB
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x7F333465
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x9F4E77BF

0x924EE0AB
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0xB36F9A78
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0x55DCCCC8
there! he is flown."
0x294AADD9

0x924EE0AB
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x5A6AF197
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x71D209E9

0x924EE0AB
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0xF4A914EF
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x53B4559A
moonrise."
0x2D4B0614

0x924EE0AB
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0x37E6D8EA
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x1E3D6974
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0xBF28C87A
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0xBC5018FF
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0xF7A01E77
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x96F68AA9
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x3392E743
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0xC3282C23
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x1BFA269A
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0xF5D6AF32
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x8DA96F91

0x924EE0AB
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x6617BA29
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x08C8DEBD
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x372EDAD4

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0x9C688EF9
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xD4B9AC6C
Adhesiveness?"
0x4FA792EC

0x924EE0AB
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x9A6DE398

0x924EE0AB
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0xD6599BD5
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x9946C2C2
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x2F972593

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x26BB54D3

0x924EE0AB
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0x0EBA392F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xBCCCC249
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0xED5D57C0
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x012A57F6
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x22B4DABA

0x924EE0AB
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0xA906D928

0x924EE0AB
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0x82F8F92E
must."
0xF202AD32

0x924EE0AB
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0x64863A34

0x924EE0AB
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0x459AB84A

0x924EE0AB
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0x9701ED47

0x924EE0AB
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0x098AA12A

0x924EE0AB
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0x0EBA7AD0
straight on the head."
0x52E451C2

0x924EE0AB
"Soon, sir?"
0x1DFD45AB

0x924EE0AB
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0xE1994D0D
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xC1C73199
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x3E192A46
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x29569EED
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0xA6B06BA0
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x5F7795DF
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x6E85C725
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x0380C1A5
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x73808A82
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0x301EF3D7
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xC9A9F2C3
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x70AC0859
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x255F4037
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x3C94D821
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x6474C793
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x16A81211
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0xA3B25CE7

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0x2FD5A2C3
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x56693C1B
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x880E94D4
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0x43E7C5AD

0x924EE0AB
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0x31EE31ED
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x2B920080
for you."
0x5569A381

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0x435E6D77

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0xE24550CC
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0xF558691F
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x5E9E37ED
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0xCD880326
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x3896D96B
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0x9FEA1739
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x24818E60

0x924EE0AB
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x188FD53E

0x924EE0AB
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0x7A6739B3
distance."
0x113A2A76

0x924EE0AB
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0xB45E14CD

0x924EE0AB
"From what, Jane?"
0xF5C9457A

0x924EE0AB
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0xEEB1B779

0x924EE0AB
"Well?"
0xB08D08AE

0x924EE0AB
"From _you_, sir."
0x7675301C

0x924EE0AB
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0xCF5438A1
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0xF6597C22
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x4FAC746E
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0xAC98FC46
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x28246D54
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0xC40FAB1C
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xAC2F87EE
loved.
0x6ACA00A5

0x924EE0AB
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xD52671AF

0x924EE0AB
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x5763EEF0
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x5B91F7C2
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x7EA01AFB
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0xA32423A2

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0x7B81EC05
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0x7DF5C121
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x130698D9
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0x49F0FC30
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0xF0593B8F
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0xF6F1F8CB
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x1F5330B8

0x924EE0AB
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x2E146A90
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x02FA57B0
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x8BD39936

0x924EE0AB
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x339F15AD

0x924EE0AB
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x0CDE2208
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x1C410FA5
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0x600D8D59
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x9BDEEF99
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0x75DFDD4C
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x5BC763AF
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0xD6BE0A0C
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x3C91D4A9

0x924EE0AB
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x4F47C0F9

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0xDE243EAF

0x924EE0AB
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x8ADD6073
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x86D62ECB
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0xB2A9C527
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xEE51DB4E

0x924EE0AB
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0x985BBC83

0x924EE0AB
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x7254A38E
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x5D12DCC3
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x4534FB4F
speak.
0xC5FB0F9E

0x924EE0AB
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x399E8B85
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x528DD72C
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x56255EE0
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x56E55320
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xF9DB7952
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x8C3C53B6
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x6E4E0167
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0xF62F7318
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0x57D40272
on the necessity of death."
0x3FCD2548

0x924EE0AB
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x767E8F19

0x924EE0AB
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0x23DB9E73

0x924EE0AB
"In what shape?"
0xC57B6EED

0x924EE0AB
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0xC01407F8

0x924EE0AB
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0x80D7BD6D

0x924EE0AB
"But you will have."
0x7D3A9DC4

0x924EE0AB
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x4AD9805F

0x924EE0AB
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0xA1EBE274

0x924EE0AB
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0x11C567E6

0x924EE0AB
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0xEF5D3DD1
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0x8AC52042
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x876F6050
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x8E8C5E36
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0xF10C166D
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x8EFD0376
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0xDF5662F7
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0xFF0C4ADF
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0xA21EAFEE
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0x21E97FC1
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x1EF32C1E
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0xCF9DDD0F

0x924EE0AB
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0xA068CC69
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0xF08E523B
Jane!"
0x92E10690

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x893D73ED
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0x8176F4B4
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x3A4DE3F0
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x91C6358E
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0xFAA5280D

0x924EE0AB
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x1D3F11D1

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x0E506DC1

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0x6F93E1D1
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0xB3382D65

0x924EE0AB
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x8E375A77
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0x6CFA4399

0x924EE0AB
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x41B51DD3

0x924EE0AB
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0xA018B872
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0x87B91BA1

0x924EE0AB
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0x7AD9CB73

0x924EE0AB
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x9FBB7870
best earthly companion."
0xCD8FDF31

0x924EE0AB
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x22AFDEEB

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0x1B824554
too."
0xA9A83035

0x924EE0AB
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x4973075F
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0xB68CC569
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x537D1DD3
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xD034B424
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x89B8ADD8
said--
0x7AD3EC29

0x924EE0AB
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0x42796068

0x924EE0AB
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0xB04DE946
return."
0x3ED88643

0x924EE0AB
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x1E9C5DAD

0x924EE0AB
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0xD18D2E78

0x924EE0AB
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0x08223324

0x924EE0AB
"Your bride stands between us."
0x2A8410D4

0x924EE0AB
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x72370337

0x924EE0AB
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0xA6CB9C13
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x65876F93

0x924EE0AB
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x2DF6871D
was still incredulous.
0x898D20CA

0x924EE0AB
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0xBD1DDEEE

0x924EE0AB
"Entirely."
0xE7E7F84B

0x924EE0AB
"You have no faith in me?"
0xFFA15C29

0x924EE0AB
"Not a whit."
0xABB7D9A4

0x924EE0AB
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0x61CEC110
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0xCF35C5AA
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0xFCC9BB85
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x2C3056AF
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x30578AEC
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x382D09AC
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xBF419BC3
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x59336624
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x61E9154E

0x924EE0AB
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x82300C10
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x514186AC
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x3D39918D
given me?"
0xAD23D7EE

0x924EE0AB
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x28A3728E
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0xF312B899

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x9B03F6F7

0x924EE0AB
"Why?"
0x1DD0B2F4

0x924EE0AB
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x30A1FD6A

0x924EE0AB
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x789033EE
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x9F7069AE

0x924EE0AB
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x15A5665A
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0xBA4014CB

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x794E7C9C
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0x2B85B5DE

0x924EE0AB
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x436CF553
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x193F0792

0x924EE0AB
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0x4C9F6FCC
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x87369ABB

0x924EE0AB
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0xF2A18AB4
be your wife?"
0x3C713835

0x924EE0AB
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x20D44AE5

0x924EE0AB
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xF39D3AB0

0x924EE0AB
"Edward--my little wife!"
0xB4B017F8

0x924EE0AB
"Dear Edward!"
0x644920FB

0x924EE0AB
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0xE912D128
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0xDACABBD6
happiness--I will make yours."
0x9911B8EF

0x924EE0AB
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0xD409E4EB
have her, and will hold her."
0x42875DB1

0x924EE0AB
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0xD859005B

0x924EE0AB
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xEC6CF335
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x6649ED9A
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x6A686E76
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x887C1EAD
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0xF0658972
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0xB143FDA5
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0x235FAD7E
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0xD160FE02
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0x5CB15A23
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x25EC7752
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0xFD38D77B

0x924EE0AB
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x576216B2
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x4AB114CC
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0x6A542A46
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x8894EB77

0x924EE0AB
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x328B27FA
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x3BAD45AB

0x924EE0AB
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0xB5CBE960
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0xDC65CC64
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0x32BCF71A
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x0AC07C7A

0x924EE0AB
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0x372DCB22
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xF702B855
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x7A27F837
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0xFC59EE07
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0xCAD539A1
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0x8B495FE9

0x924EE0AB
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x8D65AB84
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x426F098B

0x924EE0AB
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x20F719B7
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0xB3E0E4D8
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0xF051F559
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0xD3A25438
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0x3A98CDA2
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0xAEB528EE
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xE6C2299A
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x5DF50F10
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0xE8526A3B
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x23221B8C
strength for anything.
0xFE411798

0x924EE0AB
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0xDF34DF07
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x0C3AD96F
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
0x1740A217

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXIV
0x9DD3B565

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x415C986D
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xD34DB8E7
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0xF1755D16

0x924EE0AB
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x211A1A0F
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x9FE70648
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x0C19B8DB
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0x52004F8D
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x4861A178
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x567D38D6
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0x512CDDE5
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x43EE5D3A
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0x8F75634A

0x924EE0AB
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0xA73ED400
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x263AC299
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x443D71EE
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0xDFB0CD41
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x52BF402B
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0x37189942
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x60147C86
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0xF0AB5412
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0xFF80B720

0x924EE0AB
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x650947A4
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x6652D8AE
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0xE0CF0381
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0xFF19EBFB
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x87C42275
schoolroom.
0xD266C133

0x924EE0AB
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0xC4AC565F

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x1A015228

0x924EE0AB
"Where is he?"
0xFA5B0A1E

0x924EE0AB
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0xEFFC0907
there he stood.
0xCADF6D7F

0x924EE0AB
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xD3B197BA
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0xCAB18786
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0xF73269A2
well loved, so caressed by him.
0xD42E001F

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x5BE0E901
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x692DC692
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x99767545
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xBE97AC5B
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0xBA772E7B
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x04EF138B

0x924EE0AB
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x6781817B

0x924EE0AB
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0xB342DE5A
more.  Do you hear that?"
0xF256CF78

0x924EE0AB
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x27F73942
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0xD18F3D4F
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0x843D9C22
think almost fear.
0xECA873FD

0x924EE0AB
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x6774DC03

0x924EE0AB
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x460437D8
strange."
0xD7B9D0C3

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x443479D6
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xB488B49E

0x924EE0AB
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xB33E206A
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0x3FE0F49F
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x50FE3204
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0xA90DAABB

0x924EE0AB
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0xC003D124
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x03C45AC2
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0xEFE509E6
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x99F2A52C
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0xA7FE18B6

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x4D40204A
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x91463045
have them."
0x74222441

0x924EE0AB
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0x21290805
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0x436F1B5E
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0x39CFB5AE
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0xAD69C411

0x924EE0AB
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x04EDDB96
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0x914293EC
Quakerish governess."
0xB569FB44

0x924EE0AB
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0x0F7ED4DF
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0xF577BB5A

0x924EE0AB
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x182867AF
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0x51BC21C2

0x924EE0AB
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0xBC1B3456
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x34801C6B
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0xCA57C5F7
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x15CB853B
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0xE72A0098

0x924EE0AB
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x217FC35C
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x4885318E
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0xA3973B7D
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0xBD24C977
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x255866AB
flatter me."
0xF3B4CA52

0x924EE0AB
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0xFD55A658
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0x637AE6B8
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x004E0474
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x4D11BAA1
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0xF679A730
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0x31D37E28
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0xF8D84950
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0xAA8BF913
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x038CA535

0x924EE0AB
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x8CA6ED91

0x924EE0AB
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0xC5986E4C
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x48C93A9E
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0xCBD13988
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x6A82BF4C
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x7DCF033F
as my comforter."
0xB0E696DB

0x924EE0AB
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xD2AA9733
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0x7AB31671
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x4D9BC0A0
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x33312CBF
anticipate."
0xA10A96BC

0x924EE0AB
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x73CEC032

0x924EE0AB
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x07E4BE76
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0xBC401B39
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x0DDE81BB
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x47BE8153
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x5EFD37E1
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x1D2E4C3E
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x1DE5083D
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0x1FAFE43A
dear master."
0x56853302

0x924EE0AB
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x09F1CB39
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x69DA2692
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0x0A00B814

0x924EE0AB
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0x8BFAA73B

0x924EE0AB
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x66587E6A
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0x05EC3993
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0xDC2FFCF4
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x25F027CE
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x3EDE60FA
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0xFBD16612

0x924EE0AB
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0xD967F224
such an one?"
0x250B031E

0x924EE0AB
"I love it now."
0x30D209B9

0x924EE0AB
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x216F45C0
standard?"
0x9CADFEA7

0x924EE0AB
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0x05D84E6C
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0x709E4BC7
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x6B3E43B9
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x181AEC2B
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x691996CA
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x96F88D6B
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0x75A91F1A

0x924EE0AB
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0x91EA6D75
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x29ADF7CD

0x924EE0AB
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xE34735F7

0x924EE0AB
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0x81DAE65F
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0xFE90E3E7
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0xE22912B7
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0xE1CE62C5
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x86A8F734
pleasure to grant."
0x94E7E730

0x924EE0AB
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0xE1CA528A

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0xAB4F2EAB

0x924EE0AB
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0xC6FB12AF
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0x1084BA85

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x2E81820B
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x824FDAD5
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x90225A95

0x924EE0AB
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0xCB706AEB
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0xDE73292B
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0x7D404897
withdrawn: try again."
0x57D9461A

0x924EE0AB
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x819D118F
piqued on one point."
0x80AC7B1F

0x924EE0AB
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x1B99B5AF
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0xFE964241
request--"
0x40F20D3D

0x924EE0AB
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0x5C310A37

0x924EE0AB
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0xF5C2C853
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x2EE80F3C

0x924EE0AB
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0xA0BFD721
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x3485CF8B
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0x30B89432
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0xB0D6CAA8

0x924EE0AB
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x52ADCAFF
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0xCF21B0D9
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x04A23899

0x924EE0AB
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0xCA11BCDB
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0xE3D2E4AA
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x7C769FB6
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0xAD04BAB7
of my power?"
0x8376C783

0x924EE0AB
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0x7ACB905E
up."
0xCC515E43

0x924EE0AB
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0xEDDE1A4D
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0x7B04C0F8
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0xCF7F1B96
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x76D39256

0x924EE0AB
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x89D5DA04
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x7D7B44C4
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0xE60CF6A7

0x924EE0AB
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0x2C673363
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x3AE01B64
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xC7AEE57C
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0xF58DE9BE

0x924EE0AB
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x9C12CB8C
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x2FCE4152
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x69874068
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x3EDDCD56
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x19E66394
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x6048C0B4
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0xE5CAA459
made me the offer."
0x9ADD1186

0x924EE0AB
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x60E7D602

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x11811337
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x42FB9A99
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0xFFC1F271

0x924EE0AB
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x076E6CA5
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0xA7B6E42D
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x66864DB0

0x924EE0AB
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0x2F31234F
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0xF64AE027

0x924EE0AB
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x25B664F9
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0xFE3FB527
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x0A396BA9
deserted?"
0x66EA2D3E

0x924EE0AB
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x1BD69A1C
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0xD461E5BF
moment."
0xE11C1BFF

0x924EE0AB
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0x5E4CFC12
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x4308983D

0x924EE0AB
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0xAB7C04F4
awry for want of attention."
0x76149848

0x924EE0AB
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0xDE9FB959
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0xB19A5EA3
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0xCFBC80A7

0x924EE0AB
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x7775C005
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x7D34B5E1
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0xD1A3A59D

0x924EE0AB
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0xD18A56BB
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0xC97FA2DB
express.
0x19A60752

0x924EE0AB
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x93A17FBF
entreated, and to yield."
0x89C56D68

0x924EE0AB
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0xB06B8624
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x0DCA559F
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0xB865779C
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x0CC09F95

0x924EE0AB
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0xA85F99B9
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x9C6D93DF
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x4ACDCF28
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0xB5C04912

0x924EE0AB
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0x7E443898

0x924EE0AB
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x5ED2CBA7
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xBE97329C

0x924EE0AB
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x6DEDB7E0
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xEF43EC4B
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x3DCA7E6A
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0x94FB63CA
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0xFE802055
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0xCEF1F74E
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x4A7B789B
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x0103EF7A
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x762160E8
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0xC65E344A

0x924EE0AB
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0x20C5DB0C
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x1C9753E0
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x05B88FAB
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0xABA5D711
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x8A244A2F
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xA362555B
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xC5804A2C
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x1C03989F
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x2099BFBA
you would be his wife."
0x6CECB322

0x924EE0AB
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x54C10E0D

0x924EE0AB
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0x1E458336

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0xE794BF9F
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0x81AF7AF3
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0xD949C2E2

0x924EE0AB
"He tells me so."
0x0FA1EEB1

0x924EE0AB
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0xF7348E32
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x41151CEC

0x924EE0AB
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x6EBA82B9
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0xD4D67BAB
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x2CF708B2
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0xB3B911F3
father."
0xFB6E0999

0x924EE0AB
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x9DDEA546
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x49EEB3D9
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x905ED39F
twenty."
0xF322A5D8

0x924EE0AB
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x79ED4650

0x924EE0AB
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0x42BFD055
eyes.
0x6605AF4D

0x924EE0AB
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x7D90974C
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x3A2F65D0
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x2D7A4738
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0x8DBBA42C
I expect."
0x54B49584

0x924EE0AB
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0xCE0E41ED
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x68F9798F

0x924EE0AB
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x514779D3
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x3CC26E33
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0x8F2C6909
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x8FEB9D87
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0xD1D95FE6
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x8C040D3D
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x3FCE706D
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x1DFBBA4A
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x9E89AEB7
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0xF2A384DD
him."
0x70E6A4A9

0x924EE0AB
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0xE93E82F6
that all was right."
0x09FBFA6A

0x924EE0AB
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xA2C2EE2D
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x4FDB32C2
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xE81D00EA
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0x573C953E

0x924EE0AB
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0x53A3F70B

0x924EE0AB
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x473F305B
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0x711B25A9
me go mademoiselle."
0x59C400C2

0x924EE0AB
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0xDC42E258
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x584334FD
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0x95D49F57
backwards and forwards.
0x38AC9664

0x924EE0AB
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x5DAFEF72

0x924EE0AB
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0x45A4D2AD

0x924EE0AB
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0xA475354A

0x924EE0AB
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x01E4CB50

0x924EE0AB
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x1329B06F
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0xC7A54C4A
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0xF134E802
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x2BC075D5
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x4C950075
my face.
0xC84D4435

0x924EE0AB
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x4FC80CFD
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xB833AE68

0x924EE0AB
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x4AF343DC

0x924EE0AB
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0xCD9E4066
to Adele.
0xFF13CD56

0x924EE0AB
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0xA2D377D0

0x924EE0AB
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x34FC78A8
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x20ED2126
company--for life."
0x1F480B22

0x924EE0AB
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0xEE84663F
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x308490A0
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x8828FA96
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0xF4064BF2
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x56C09133

0x924EE0AB
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0xF4B44549
there is plenty of room on this side."
0xC58FB83F

0x924EE0AB
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0xD3CCAB69
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xF4117BFF

0x924EE0AB
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x948A06D9
mademoiselle?"
0x72EBA8BF

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0x98227095
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x1FD668D9
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x8BB83265
there, and only me."
0xCB26BB5D

0x924EE0AB
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0x6F8624E9

0x924EE0AB
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x30FAB3C6
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x0C16808A

0x924EE0AB
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0x21756077

0x924EE0AB
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x906F1665
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xCF744F75

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x1401DC87
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0xE26135EF

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x36F864AD
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0xBC34DA35
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x77364C67
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0x22BE98E8

0x924EE0AB
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xBCA5C986
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0xE8A6810B
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x251DDAB9

0x924EE0AB
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x4E22A9DF

0x924EE0AB
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x48C6BE0D
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0x911A2C2F

0x924EE0AB
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x88773137
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xBBC241A6
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x64F57266
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0xE098C033

0x924EE0AB
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0x3CDD9949
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0xE845208D
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0xD13FC049
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x55D6E80F
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0xF9B443AA
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x52F5327F
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x23AF5315
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0x45ED28E8
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x8FF58097
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xF2930DD6
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0xBFE73B4E
effect--
0x665E61B0

0x924EE0AB
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0xE4ECEFF1
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xBAABD22F
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x3C08376B
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x5871A590
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0xE4BBE453
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x44735659

0x924EE0AB
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0xD3944C88
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0xAB49194F
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x02FFA730
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0x2B1EB787
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x541EB42D
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0xEC5C8808
again."
0xDB9B5DD0

0x924EE0AB
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x1DAE4272
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x24857CEA

0x924EE0AB
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x9C3E8863
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x09D9194F
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x834D0F9B
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x2775F327
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x52467675
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x309CD32A
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0xCE43CF19

0x924EE0AB
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x61F1CF3A
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0xE68B8B56
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x6251BE7E
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0xA9CDA6AF
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x87422F81
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xBD3295C9
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x06288090
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x11BAD76E
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x55EB5A9F
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x5F272784
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x6AD507AE
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0xAFBA0344
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x00B998DD
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xA0790E5F

0x924EE0AB
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xE09A66CF
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x0F2BF203
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0xA7542288
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0x5B8616EE
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0x5FF7E733
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0xDA690E3D
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0x9EC8F5E7
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x76201EE2
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x0A696A50
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x6D0EA516
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0xF640D6A3
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0xB9816715
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x9DE6842F
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0xB009FAD4
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0xD4422101
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0xF4D2172A
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x4C4D3C46
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x5A196804
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0xD26160AB
passionate pressure.
0x049F8302

0x924EE0AB
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0xB7DCE508
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x18AD641B
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0xEE6985B6
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0xE591CBAF
satin."
0x733EDA3A

0x924EE0AB
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x02FF263E
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x8DA0D1FB
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x2C353149
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x06FCAC94

0x924EE0AB
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0x91F832F6
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x62CC2210
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0xD9DA0113
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x712B626A
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0x7D34EF1C
satisfactorily here."
0xACF54674

0x924EE0AB
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xAB117061
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x7AF32735

0x924EE0AB
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0xDA287B42
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0xF99E96E2
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0xAC7DF483
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0x449C6ED1
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0xAEB9B441
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x3DCB058E

0x924EE0AB
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0x52779B98

0x924EE0AB
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0x9C86DB32
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0xBAA395FA
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0x84C5063D
would be to violate its conditions."
0x2F7EB765

0x924EE0AB
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x3FADD0DF
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0x67257210
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0xC4B599CB

0x924EE0AB
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0xB2FCBA18
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x9E199C55
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0x09D2C767
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0xBD8C6C3B
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0xA364BA5B
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0x668B6872

0x924EE0AB
"Well, but what?"
0x6B7CEC2B

0x924EE0AB
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0x92EA6DC0

0x924EE0AB
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x25585EE4
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x64F4684B
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0x99453094

0x924EE0AB
"No, thank you, sir."
0xBC1284E7

0x924EE0AB
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0xEFC3040B

0x924EE0AB
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0x5CBA194A
till--"
0xEFA569B0

0x924EE0AB
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0xE1382D24

0x924EE0AB
"Till I can't help it."
0x77410619

0x924EE0AB
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0x607F5156
companion of my repast?"
0x86AC33CA

0x924EE0AB
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0x1A93B204
usual for another month."
0xFE148FD1

0x924EE0AB
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0x170A3049

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0x684CDB6B
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0xE7676628
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0xD4E7EB8D
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0x253F6D7C

0x924EE0AB
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0xD1317AF9
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0x119E6BD7
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0x6D78E30C
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0xBEDFCEB2
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x6536C440
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x1959BF2C
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x1B586962
my jewel I should tyne."
0x6321D790

0x924EE0AB
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x415078CE
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x8C77B5CE
retreat upstairs.
0xFE2803D0

0x924EE0AB
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x4B2D2B96
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xDAB61404
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x3137618D
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x2B9E9FF5
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0xF4023018
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x4BBCBC9A
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0x0D870060
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0xF949F303
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x8CD8E18B
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x4A42023B
the present.
0x32A08049

0x924EE0AB
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x9CFE65B7

0x924EE0AB
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0xCA9FE30A
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0xC27AD3B9
stimulate it.
0xFC9E1826

0x924EE0AB
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x1A2CCC09

0x924EE0AB
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x932FC9A9

0x924EE0AB
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x40682648
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0x9DE1CC74
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x8565DF9F
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x2ECEF632
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x350EA079
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0xC1CE4FB0
strain:--
0x2846C9C4

0x924EE0AB
   "The truest love that ever heart
0xF39358D2
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x6481BE74
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0xB4FE3EA7
      The tide of being pour.
0x18035C56

0x924EE0AB
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x3C66773E
      Her parting was my pain;
0xF9992A33
   The chance that did her steps delay
0xF9AD0EF4
      Was ice in every vein.
0x5ADE9D70

0x924EE0AB
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x7E9D4115
      As I loved, loved to be;
0x0582218C
   And to this object did I press
0xA5CAB238
      As blind as eagerly.
0xF2EA2C1B

0x924EE0AB
   But wide as pathless was the space
0xECD524A1
      That lay our lives between,
0x449E57AA
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0xB1E37A4A
      Of ocean-surges green.
0x06FCFC5D

0x924EE0AB
   And haunted as a robber-path
0xC194AEA2
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x285E6FC8
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x3FB64D71
      Between our spirits stood.
0xEC50A909

0x924EE0AB
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x1332CAEE
      I omens did defy:
0xB5DAA6D1
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0xC14AABB8
      I passed impetuous by.
0xA1580759

0x924EE0AB
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x933C924A
      I flew as in a dream;
0x6E9B628B
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0x6723A686
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x3FB4A397

0x924EE0AB
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xE7029053
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x58941A07
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xF0E078FA
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x834A2A17

0x924EE0AB
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x2997E85E
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x30B94C98
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0xB59549CE
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0x1F6F664C

0x924EE0AB
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0xA719F99F
      Right, bar approach to me,
0x8CCFE201
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x38882BCA
      Swear endless enmity.
0x64B47EAA

0x924EE0AB
   My love has placed her little hand
0xFDE8B49F
      With noble faith in mine,
0x07BED1CD
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x62C6ED3D
      Our nature shall entwine.
0x5E0EF56A

0x924EE0AB
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x1E3A9F3A
      With me to live--to die;
0xA7E460B4
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xECB865B7
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x0A69A31D

0x924EE0AB
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0x32E15DAF
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0xCC3004E4
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x518428FC
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x169850E7
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x42106C51
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xF1E66BB0

0x924EE0AB
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x6CB9C069

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x09B15082
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0x36ED4CC6
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0x4B8D9FA0

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x43A2ABB4
Death was not for such as I."
0x29E84A1A

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x6A314FCC
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0xCDF2BBAE

0x924EE0AB
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0x4FC823D9
reconciling kiss?"
0x88DD8A9E

0x924EE0AB
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x54F9E97A

0x924EE0AB
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x500516D5
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x4A73274D
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x540ED4EE

0x924EE0AB
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0xCD3761CF
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x89537987
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0xAFCFDBC0
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0x9B8CD33F
time to rescind it.
0x2C213C0D

0x924EE0AB
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x0776A1DA

0x924EE0AB
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0xA62052C5
myself I was doing that now."
0x0EE22945

0x924EE0AB
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x1D39DA92
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0x2B14EA42
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x58A15927
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0x3B9BD761
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0xF9AD8AA3
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x0EE3B27A
advantage."
0x8D4039D1

0x924EE0AB
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xFE3B4F51
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x2FF66C2B
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0xDDA001A5
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x461ABF48

0x924EE0AB
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xE4B5C319
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xBCCA15D3
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x0831B5A1
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x5913026E
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x14FB456A
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x2DF25574

0x924EE0AB
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0x2E40540F
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x14D05857
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0x8F3408D6
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x86138FD8
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x311040DD
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x0CC46F90
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x4AE4A760
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0xFF13277D
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x6A27BFED
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xE28DA30F
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x03175FD0
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0xB945D079
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x50ECC03F
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x834FFC81
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0xEB7E8E9A
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x3D505A2A
virtue, another must be devised."
0xB9E62043

0x924EE0AB
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0x2544A09F
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x8068631D
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0x19201B31
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x71BF98D5
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x6E1BC064
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x18A6D4CB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x385CEDCD
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0xDC6FDFAF
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x1F409114
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x4AC4264A
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0x40F3F658
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x53129110
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0x9AB21F90
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x2FB4F691
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x24516411
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0xDD84AE10
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0xF86303EF
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0xEDE34CE1
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x40A7C32D
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x88E8823A
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x56DFDFBD
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xDA2186C4
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x36B1327E
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x6DA8D3F2
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0xD4E338F6
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x9BE2B7CF
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x852E3FB7
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0xEB7A84FC
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x0AD30F07

0x924EE0AB
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0xF7C72784
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0xD6A1535E
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x8686D008
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x324EC2A8
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x80A27BFB
more than they.
0xEC20CBE2

0x924EE0AB
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0xE8154CBF
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x1631948C
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0xB380D5E2
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0x48FF43CB
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0xE8EB32E2
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0xAEA55D0E
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x3DC96075
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0xEC980D19
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0x97535AB7
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0xBD338F95

0x924EE0AB
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0x1510DBA3
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0xAB84DC47
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x289E9854
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x4C38C834
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0x034DE0F9
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0xFFA0721C
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0xC6CD2E20
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x17F502E7

0x924EE0AB
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0xE9705668
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x9C136ED9
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x550A76B1
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0xB81FFB63
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x4B5A51BB
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0x15AFBD6D
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x7762A1DD
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x56EFF3E6
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x6C75E646
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x6EBDD482

0x924EE0AB
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0xA8FEB7B6
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0xAAA5784D
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x06C5AAC7
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x8CABEC20
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x8F56FAC7
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x1278F891
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0xF641094A
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x5581BE03
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0x4E966BD4
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0xA81405C5
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x90FD8227
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x8F72B4D2
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x0869260D
listen to, and I ran off again.
0x7C708AE1

0x924EE0AB
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x33C823A2
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0xA39CD19D
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0xF52C24FA
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0xC5AA0692
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0xB4CD4D5E
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0x013F7184
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0xBB64F9AB
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0x96005637
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0xDC4EEB38
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x219B490C
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0xD2D7E510
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x6FDCC720
simultaneously struck ten.
0x8AFA56A7

0x924EE0AB
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0xD800B343
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x30432BB3
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x33957038

0x924EE0AB
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0x193FE8EC
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0x3D80615E
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0xA8C66C07
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0xE0D07735
by one moving speck.
0x12A89F37

0x924EE0AB
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0x6BCC4651
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xA9AED8E7
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x8D73F4F0
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0xAA265D54

0x924EE0AB
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0xD355357F
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0x7E2F29DE
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0xF96EB149
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x8F60D57E
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0xB658B3BF
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0xD661D516
meridian, and must now decline.
0x47C1139D

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x7404089A
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0xDDC15F16
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0x9273DEA5

0x924EE0AB
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0x8E9CCDA3
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xEB237340
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0xE66AEEC1
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x5AA8D354
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x7F8ABE5A
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0xEFABC69C

0x924EE0AB
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0x2FC25E98
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x6A6EE15C
give me both hands: mount!"
0xBBA16A8E

0x924EE0AB
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x943242B3
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x646124D2
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0xC83E2038
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x39ED4DD5
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0xD38BFBD6

0x924EE0AB
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0x8D755D40
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x809C906D

0x924EE0AB
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0x764B2102
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x243BD86B
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x1B653C45

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0x8E3C090A

0x924EE0AB
"Then you have been both?"
0xF3036C75

0x924EE0AB
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x17B30DE9
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0xD7F21A98

0x924EE0AB
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x8A207B0B
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0xCE8D55FE
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x7E3A2AA7
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0x39C5C910
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xC0790034
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0xE400FC30

0x924EE0AB
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xEFB16F43
get down."
0x61092E78

0x924EE0AB
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x39E7A6CF
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0xA6F3DF31
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xEA67DAD9
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0xB425DB00
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x07F77910

0x924EE0AB
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x1E8BA2C2
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x88CB2718

0x924EE0AB
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xCC6A83D1
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xED2539F5
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0x1E664F0A

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0x08B5377E
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0xC95ED8D2

0x924EE0AB
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x546066B3

0x924EE0AB
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x5D7C5420

0x924EE0AB
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0xFD4C7B59
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0xE162214F
as a long, strong arm.
0xD6C2BD9D

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xE4B160A1
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x55FA05B9

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Jane."
0xFCF3F441

0x924EE0AB
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0xDC23A96D
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x808502D9

0x924EE0AB
"It is near midnight," I said.
0xBF35ABD0

0x924EE0AB
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x856BF64B
my wedding."
0x9B0008B3

0x924EE0AB
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xE1D5EF6C
no wish to go to bed."
0x466787E0

0x924EE0AB
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0xAB4CE658

0x924EE0AB
"All, sir."
0xD0A97552

0x924EE0AB
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0x576788EC
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0xC3BA6D30
from church."
0x93071AFE

0x924EE0AB
"Very well, sir."
0x69507071

0x924EE0AB
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xB8A1B4A9
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0xC72160DC
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0x1D9EF467

0x924EE0AB
"I believe I am."
0xA026A6C5

0x924EE0AB
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x0FB9007C

0x924EE0AB
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xD02DE0AF
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xC306D373
charged?"
0x62247F60

0x924EE0AB
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0xFE0DAE52
over-fatigued."
0x1ED59F52

0x924EE0AB
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xC7D356AF

0x924EE0AB
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x2E41B99A

0x924EE0AB
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0x248A894B
and flushed.
0xBDD78002

0x924EE0AB
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xBA5153E7
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0x75EC81BF
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x25659278

0x924EE0AB
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x8E018FEB

0x924EE0AB
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0xEE8E2EDD
new life into which you are passing?"
0x77935E9A

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0xA70365B0
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x9C872C35

0x924EE0AB
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0xAD500531

0x924EE0AB
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0xD8E3AAC1
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xEB0C61A5
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x1942144E
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0xCD9376E3
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0xE3F46C03

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x4EB55F65
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0xFA972E3D
proceeded.
0x9E2FA11E

0x924EE0AB
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0xB3B124E4
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x9ACDB01E
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0xAE48AD88
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0x2B29812A
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0xFF7D84BC
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0xF205B708
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x708F0ED9
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0xCE0C2074
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0x25BA7EAC
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x96629400
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x543BDB6C
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x9500DA25
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x26E5CC35
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xBB54BE9A
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x88DCA5DC
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0xEF473134
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0x5B74AB02
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x85F55EBB
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x267F7C7B
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x8D09559E
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0xD1D946F7
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0x3FD9E939
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x62A5ECCC
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0x5DAD4CC1
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x09B88AE3
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x72A1DFCD
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0xD81D46AB
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0x8F37EA0B
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x71E09CBB
coronet."
0x0D9D9380

0x924EE0AB
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0x98126A91
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x0141E344
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x325325E8

0x924EE0AB
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x27239F82
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x5AE683F6
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x983F232E
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x38A8AB38
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x2C2455F4
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0xF35ABCA5
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0xBF52BED0
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0xCAD00ED9
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x74B5B91D
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0x93750186
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0xAC06F73B
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0x6D3DA816
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0xA07C05F6
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x8236AEC7
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x80BBCE97
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xB895550C
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0xDC8E071C
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0xCB72FD94
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0xE675F87F
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xE357882B
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0xAE947D68
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x20202CDB
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x1BF25F26
moment."
0xE11C1BFF

0x924EE0AB
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0x94B20AD6
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x9A49BE95
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xA8BF6471
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0xB704C805
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xC4BFFF7B
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x995A5906
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0xE427B79E
Jane?--repeat it."
0x5F934A71

0x924EE0AB
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0x355519DA

0x924EE0AB
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0xF841FB12
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x83DA43C9
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xB7F6D782
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x9A5A438D
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x4862A2C9
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x0DA088AA
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0x867423FF
incensed than saddened."
0xCED71FBE

0x924EE0AB
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xF946A24C
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0xEA75AD5A

0x924EE0AB
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0x453FF299
of your melancholy in a dream."
0xF071A687

0x924EE0AB
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x2FA0C42E
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0x98D3BEFE

0x924EE0AB
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x8B4552D6
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x9B593C6A

0x924EE0AB
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0xBB3A8BF4
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0xB94DDBCA
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x22CDEA38
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x1D6EC147
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x844AD3A6
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0xEA0658BD
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x399D95A0
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x6109B0CE
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0xE138513D
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xAF47FE99
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0x148252A2
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x6DCB1EDD
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x72303B5A
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0x55B1868C
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0xBCBA10E6
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x3F43AC97
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x707A9AEF
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0x6F2E7588
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x6D0ADECE
woke."
0xDDFAD23E

0x924EE0AB
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x5D28F810

0x924EE0AB
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0xAD335060
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xA37DEEFE
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0xDCA9559B
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x684FF17D
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x8D2E105A
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0xB60A030F
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x1B73003E
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0xCED35F90
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0xC334A454
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x20C2FADC
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x66B9FF5A
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0x3098DE8A
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0x9607A347

0x924EE0AB
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xD4BAF859

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x15008E3E
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0x349FA6A1
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0x494D756C

0x924EE0AB
"Describe it, Jane."
0xA2CEFD87

0x924EE0AB
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0xAC9597CD
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0xE2DB1526
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x35F3E72E

0x924EE0AB
"Did you see her face?"
0x47420561

0x924EE0AB
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x0EE91D18
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xD5046361
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x84ECF6E5
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0x057512E0

0x924EE0AB
"And how were they?"
0xFF87B50B

0x924EE0AB
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0xC1F7D92B
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x5F42D419
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0x0A62BD08

0x924EE0AB
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0x6DC1C107

0x924EE0AB
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x44DB3CF0
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0x6F3B7792
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0x5727BF74

0x924EE0AB
"You may."
0xDFD0D243

0x924EE0AB
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0xA5D67902

0x924EE0AB
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0xEB8B7E5D

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0xEC33B1DD
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0x7D28BF9C

0x924EE0AB
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x41CB0C10
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0x249C8D24

0x924EE0AB
"Afterwards?"
0xE8176B74

0x924EE0AB
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0xC1E20E82
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x3CF455D3
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xA50F0DF9
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0xB4EA4197
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xE446D733
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0xB2F975FC
from terror."
0xD5F1651F

0x924EE0AB
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0xD43E9500

0x924EE0AB
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0x47D98AFC
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0xA43803B8
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0x3A6AAEA5
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0x4E7F85DC

0x924EE0AB
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x6895A242
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x0BCEDB5E
handling."
0xD655412D

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0xA3743B73
transaction actually took place."
0xDC966FAE

0x924EE0AB
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0x08FB719F
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0xA979FCEA
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x2D409F4A

0x924EE0AB
"Not yet."
0x5BBF01E7

0x924EE0AB
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0xFC9889A1
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xE3737B09
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x29C91EEC

0x924EE0AB
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x05FE4815
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0xD05CA2C8
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x43D14B6F

0x924EE0AB
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0xAC14CA71

0x924EE0AB
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xA07450D8
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x9BD7E8C2
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0xEFE7D277
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x1B1F172D
to bottom in two halves!"
0xF8DE2C37

0x924EE0AB
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0xF3DB0136
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x9CF12853
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x341CE32C
might have happened!"
0x361081A7

0x924EE0AB
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0x80DA931E
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x061014A3

0x924EE0AB
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0xCA701705
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x085B44BA
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0xFC125798
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0xD080586A
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x7C267011
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x6E7D4A03
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x18CB6E15
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0xBBBCC946
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0xE5B64AE5
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x36FDADAE
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0xA8893394
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x26477D7E
solution of the mystery?"
0xD770A500

0x924EE0AB
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0x8CACD040
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0xFD9A1FDA
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0x243B13F8
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x6E914508

0x924EE0AB
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0xA707135F
candle.
0x11CF5FFC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0xFD762D8F
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0x47B97229
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0xA3C2FE5C
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0xA171C0C4

0x924EE0AB
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x2E22D7D4

0x924EE0AB
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0xD2DFECBD
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0x87B3225D
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xD06B006E
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0xCF4E1405
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x105B3B40
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x8AB5BDCC
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x4F222D56

0x924EE0AB
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0xB21FB101
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x7AFE07E9
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0xD65FEE00

0x924EE0AB
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0xF532F202
Janet now?"
0x3E712F1D

0x924EE0AB
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x61C659A2

0x924EE0AB
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xB78D0B61
love and blissful union."
0x10D10749

0x924EE0AB
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0xEA5C4AD2
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0x54216F7C
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x758E4B72
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x7F808D54
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x47BD6DF1
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0x4A2CF8C3
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x4877BBC4
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x76A21F5B
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0xA392A273
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0xD0ADEC17
day.

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXVI
0xBAF0172E

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0x8800B995
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0x38EB1DC2
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0x19CEA5DA
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x807D92E2
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0xB849386D

0x924EE0AB
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x9C9894A3
not taken one peep."
0xF12CC0EF

0x924EE0AB
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x2CD69CE7
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0xCAA8D634
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0xA4857762
by Mr. Rochester.
0x7E08AEA0

0x924EE0AB
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x4CE233C9
so long!"
0x3AE1B9E4

0x924EE0AB
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x15218055
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x947B3530
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0xAB1FACBA
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x244FA124
footman, answered it.
0xCD14D879

0x924EE0AB
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xFA4BB4C6

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0x4038E930

0x924EE0AB
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0xDE52A3FE

0x924EE0AB
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x3B77A594
there: return and tell me."
0x0F1827FC

0x924EE0AB
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xD1E0AE12
footman soon returned.
0x328A22F1

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0xCCB12115

0x924EE0AB
"And the carriage?"
0xD670B91B

0x924EE0AB
"The horses are harnessing."
0x3049B34A

0x924EE0AB
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0xD060E44D
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0xFD8E6632
coachman in his seat."
0x09B65E65

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x9DAF2BB4

0x924EE0AB
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0xB9750F22
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x5BEFA644
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x1F438188
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x184E3676
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0xCC011536
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0x63DAAF6E
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x2B7DDC04
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0xD3C4BB68
and flashing eyes.
0x5AC64C45

0x924EE0AB
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x51455445
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xCEA356EA
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x736C4AE3
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0xA70D8481
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0xC5171F5F
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x8D8AD195

0x924EE0AB
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x841D74E2
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x2BBD1463
me, Jane."
0x7BAE25A8

0x924EE0AB
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xEEF2DDD9
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0xE2CB6EDF
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0xD2584049
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x59AB91DD
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x93E55C0B
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0xFCBE6846
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x03FC1C5E
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x6BCDB2A6
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0xAFCD4A2B
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x159E2A85
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0xA7A95C9B
path to the porch.
0x1B2E6FCE

0x924EE0AB
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x03DC4F8C
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x2DE91172
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x6F87219A
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x86E7F6DE
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x77F15CF4
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x2B31F6A0
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0xBBDA7815
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x0E5503DE

0x924EE0AB
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x6C9CCDAB
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0xDED46E5A
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0xFB781F89
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x2F75C9DA
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x26E22763
Rochester, went on.
0xC2FB6856

0x924EE0AB
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x2F8C97A3
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x79893ABF
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0xC17C58FC
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0x06B121E7
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x0447029B
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0xFFAEFB0B

0x924EE0AB
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0x113FD593
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x8AA9570D
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0xD45DD22A
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x9EBDB092
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0xCE73CCAC
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x0B925F57

0x924EE0AB
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0x47187762

0x924EE0AB
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0x28AB51D5
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x70518DB9
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x22879D5F
said, "Proceed."
0xF7388D4E

0x924EE0AB
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0xC6340ADE
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xA75DEB15

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x2A14EE6E
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x37498253

0x924EE0AB
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0xF4610393
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x5030BAD0
marriage exists."
0xA86A6BCA

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x888EFC49
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x1A3EF2EF
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x4BAE34F2
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x7749DA52
beneath!
0xA882885A

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0xE6D1755A
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x61B6BA00

0x924EE0AB
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0xE116B918
advisedly."
0x5344F56E

0x924EE0AB
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x45C032D7
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x3A71A5C3

0x924EE0AB
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0xBA120A4F
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x84DBEF7E

0x924EE0AB
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xDAB9453A
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0x2F970841
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xE259099A
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0xC5124617
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0x3CAB0A2C
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xD67A0AD6
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x5D8C0B78
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x20E8F9DA

0x924EE0AB
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0x90FB8BB8

0x924EE0AB
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x7AD0E185

0x924EE0AB
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x0D7358F1

0x924EE0AB
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0xE6CF59D1
recognises, if you do not."
0xF81AAF00

0x924EE0AB
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x129C83CE
place of abode."
0x1C962A47

0x924EE0AB
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0x57FD3992
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x7523B446

0x924EE0AB
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xDACB208F
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0x6920AF2D
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x5E59F07A
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0x76F18CFB
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0x1B97EDF9
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0xF201B1E3
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0xF673A177
Mason.'"
0x15D6C0BB

0x924EE0AB
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x0D6A7F0E
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x68E1DA80

0x924EE0AB
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x65DC4D42

0x924EE0AB
"How do you know?"
0xEB3E3D60

0x924EE0AB
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x4ED7B25A
scarcely controvert."
0xD9B67C63

0x924EE0AB
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x448119E3

0x924EE0AB
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0xEE35F9EB
goodness to step forward."
0x58453F02

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0xF9BF5F50
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0x6409F811
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0xA2969CBB
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0xE3A93E1D
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0xA7A748A6
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0xC4DC17CA
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0xF3F84B04
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0xB94D9E0E
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x0454566D
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0xA3EED40B
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x59DCF686
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0xBE5D2DED
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x2CD36F46
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xDABAB800

0x924EE0AB
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0xC5B25957

0x924EE0AB
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x931C313C
what have you to say?"
0x8A3728EC

0x924EE0AB
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x12687F01
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x2A8363B7
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x41958CB8

0x924EE0AB
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0xE7C05558

0x924EE0AB
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x44CEE3CD
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x6827FA29

0x924EE0AB
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0xAF0A2753
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x2D40589D
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0xAD2DB767

0x924EE0AB
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x533D5C26

0x924EE0AB
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0xD7E16925
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x342FA35B
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0xE614798F

0x924EE0AB
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xFD035079
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0x1B3AE413
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x38E93015
obeyed.
0x0F0973FE

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x3210275C
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x57F8A548
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0xCA5CAFAD
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x68F90C4D
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0x667BE4C8
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x7DC63984
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x804FA21F
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xB2C3A062
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0xEEED7F99
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x13423575
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0xA2A018EE
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0x9A5DE17C
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x9E2AADFA
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x1E2D1DEF
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x48252AB4
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x9C1D4F31
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x843B95B0
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x9E40057C
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x4034282C
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x0D037DAD
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0x392B7DD7
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x0454A4A5
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x8CD66BD9
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x63B2DDB8
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0xA3856EFB
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0x2128E393
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x110C58DF
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0xFDF22ED9
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x3240E83E
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x01515C71
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x5CCE0F8F
you--follow!"
0x70FCF4A1

0x924EE0AB
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x789BFB91
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0xC3AA0AA4

0x924EE0AB
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x021831E6
will not be wanted to-day."
0x1CF0F9EC

0x924EE0AB
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0x2B1B6D52
greet us.
0xCFCA88CA

0x924EE0AB
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x188F916C
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0xE1AE82BD
late!"
0x59CE4546

0x924EE0AB
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0xEE0208A5
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x5384D848
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x9C6B0396
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xF9A0A3C6
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0x087816DA

0x924EE0AB
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0x710FD25D
here."
0xF9368B7B

0x924EE0AB
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x129A20E9
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0x79673723
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x8E0F2F01
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x1D5DDECB
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x9B3A7A01
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x0B6726BA
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x73887A90
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0x7FB272E0
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0xF594FAB4
mane, hid its head and face.
0x478A166A

0x924EE0AB
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0xBCFF0A9D
your charge to-day?"
0x0AA902EE

0x924EE0AB
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x40742114
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x14A7803A

0x924EE0AB
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0xBBA7C1D6
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0xF05F9A87

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x84F0D4D1

0x924EE0AB
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x5D2EF37E

0x924EE0AB
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0xBF27D849

0x924EE0AB
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x29BE5FCE
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x6649D25E
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x16534D57

0x924EE0AB
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xB815225B
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0xF9BFAF4D

0x924EE0AB
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x49231295
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x8F71986E

0x924EE0AB
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x00FE7849

0x924EE0AB
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0xAD021D12

0x924EE0AB
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x15B564B9
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x1B5A3C27
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0x0031B14D
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0xCB034F7C
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0xCEEE1B73
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0xAC87499D
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x8BBDEBF7
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0xFE59C4FF
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x7FE5F395
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x640F5983
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x8D2D83C1
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x6FF3E80B

0x924EE0AB
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0xEAF66E9C
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0xB98CC08D
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0xFDAFA667
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x5DDCD41A
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x3A1BEC4D
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xD14FF43A
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0xAFA767F2
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x37CF435F
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x29341746
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x43DB0CBC

0x924EE0AB
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xC2D69C72
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0x87E2F4F3
the stair.
0xF5213550

0x924EE0AB
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x48C19409
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x3BC20502
returns to Madeira."
0xA31C5A15

0x924EE0AB
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x62586C7A

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xBF60AB8D
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xEFAF1E3F
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x7AA31CEC
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0xCD2C89F7
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0xCFFAD097
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x1E4D1233
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0xA412A0CF
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x7821EB07
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0xA81DC225
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xB4D01A84
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0xA4E6CA9F
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x4E8A7070
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x5CD841F6
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x9CAD3873
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x5D2A2A34
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0x60B2F754
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x4EE2099B
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0xC9887BBE
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xC84D2B65

0x924EE0AB
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xD3DEE0F7
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0xD0DBEBF8
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xEB5F9F44
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x4D2E02E8

0x924EE0AB
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x30DEB607
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x1C4B9E05
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x0E3DF581
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0x0305EDC3
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x9E397801
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0xBC216146
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0xB44C7E8F
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x28DB28BA
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0x86384B7D
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0xC64EC943

0x924EE0AB
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0xFB8B2086
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x942F9A36
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0x9672BF3E
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x9A6ED009
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0xFCC7A673
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0x5F3A0F9A
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x5F68D34F
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0x87650104

0x924EE0AB
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x3D796715
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0xE6D8447D
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xB4BE8805
prospects?
0x48C50DCB

0x924EE0AB
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0xB9B9D3B0
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0xCC621DA5
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x272C6920
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x914520F0
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x011ACFE8
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0xAA61EC07
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xC2CDE06F
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0x4B567516
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xB016069F
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x1EDF5FD9
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x868C4F47
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x5C5E243D
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xF9BF2445
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0xF0465E0D
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0xE2161F17
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x31F1E5F7
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x2FC534B1
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x5FE1EE75
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0xF5C09DF0
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x0F530805
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x81677372
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x9C892356
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0xA8A28A62
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0xD2BD7181
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x00FBE827
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x3791C89E
conduct!
0xDF49BD99

0x924EE0AB
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0xBEA549E6
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x7650F4CF
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x95A121A7
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x33E257A5
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0xCD728691
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xCEB2B4DC
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x462BF300
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0xBED3E246
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0xD716FB63

0x924EE0AB
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0xE86A97FE

0x924EE0AB
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x7EEA8E75
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0xC1C67D24
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x5398BA12
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x2040C3C4
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x02436BF7
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0xA706B65D
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0xEA349B08
floods overflowed me."
0xB4608E58

CHAPTER XXVII
0x8F53A556

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x1865B332
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0xA4F3906E
"What am I to do?"
0x1CF4E80E

0x924EE0AB
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0x6FBD3C2D
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x1BB23552
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x0CC3E2AE
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0xB2B866C3
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x106E3734
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0x00F48294
cannot do it."
0xF8E926AA

0x924EE0AB
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0xFC8EC25C
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x113AE569
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0x3DDC04D9
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x78D66A6C
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0xED70E155
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x2A48B4F1
depths of agony.
0x2EC19523

0x924EE0AB
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0xC7D5C801

0x924EE0AB
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0xF4945758
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0xF9E571C9
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x5CEA4AF9

0x924EE0AB
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x9AB771AA
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0xDC7E0B8A
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0xCE0A460C
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0xD524F426
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0xA5C04B7D
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0x7249D4FC
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x4E734B2B
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x257A0C91
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x2DAA855C
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0xE3267930
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x283AB319
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xB7FF4D47
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0x25E8332F
threshold.
0xC678A32E

0x924EE0AB
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0xCE139E85
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0x3FD71F3F
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x7ECE0450
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xBC0E80CE
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0xD4723B2B
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x28888237
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0x902F3B16
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0xEEE74C2C
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x47A9FCF7
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x8326BC4A

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x40E0D5C4
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0xECC630E9
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0xB51E9905

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x33863045
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x2F929692
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x96EF5533
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0x967BC64A
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x306F0262

0x924EE0AB
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0x41E68CB1
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x99ED35F4
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0xBD676F2A
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0x0333F093
heart's core.
0x4A227B21

0x924EE0AB
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0xA4D0F516
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x0F7CC06C
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0xF2D313FA

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xE7F4131E

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xB036A0DA
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x8616DCE7
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0xF5C961EF
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0xCFD62F6E
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x0D6FF5E1
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x55ABD9BA
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0xFC234242
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0xAA15961E
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x5316FACC
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x546AAF8B
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x61047A63
him."
0x70E6A4A9

0x924EE0AB
"How are you now, Jane?"
0xA37B75C6

0x924EE0AB
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x6A3D13A5

0x924EE0AB
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0xEFF90E4D

0x924EE0AB
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x4B45EB5C
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xCE6F9554
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0x5CC08B27
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x01AD0BE0
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xE77B8306
put his aside.
0x12C3ACD0

0x924EE0AB
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x96C3DAC5
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x6F8FDD9D
appropriated?"
0xA920BD82

0x924EE0AB
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x8069D23C

0x924EE0AB
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0x45D0E60E
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0xBBB8A24D
rightly?"
0xAE3A8CB4

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x11D04450
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x9693AEEF
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xFC32BE76
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x07BF4736
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x946BF7FD
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x1E5D6920
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x5396DB82
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0xDCC6DCB0
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x220F85AD
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x97B9FC49
know you--I am on my guard."
0x41D8AD3E

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x0C2CABA9
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0xA0D9F515

0x924EE0AB
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0xC8EB8994
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0x3F0260EF
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x7AFE1037
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x3F522528
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x9E8C1E0C
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x006787A8
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0xF961848A
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0xDA8F81DC

0x924EE0AB
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x720F5CAE
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x8B835714
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x8534E507
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x755B1251

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x32055CA9
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0xDADA3040
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0xC99B1BD3
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0xCA647A8B
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xCC82B24E
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xB058FB16
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x9D4935FE
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x2F73B348
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0xD44EC4C2
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xE4B0262C
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0x98E49FC9
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x1F1F794A
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0xC15790C4
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0xE3677BB8
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x8CAE20D9
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0x9B594A5D
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0xF8BF6A8C
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0xAA2B22E4

0x924EE0AB
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0x89998B12
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x58349746
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0xCE2A2268
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0xF5AB76EA
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0x6629DC1A
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x444DF17A
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x56BA24CD
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0x50F7BA81
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0xE87413E6
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x6BCA318D

0x924EE0AB
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0x0437F218
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xDE6CA531
cannot help being mad."
0xA9343A76

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x47F83BCF
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0xBA75811F
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x38C568B6

0x924EE0AB
"I do indeed, sir."
0xE136843A

0x924EE0AB
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0x431F09D3
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x1AF0F021
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x47372273
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x4A03B8D6
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xBBDF67EC
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0xE3E1B9AA
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xC9BCEB6F
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0xCFF39B84
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0xD11C852E
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x8632CBAD
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0xD9E5C307
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0xC32D2734
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x5A5EC7F1
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x8348528F
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0xEC9220DB
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0x6FB07C65
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x741FF797
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x32AFA6CD
falsehood and slander."
0x0B21A9A5

0x924EE0AB
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xA6F67931
for you."
0x5569A381

0x924EE0AB
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0xC3BDC476
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x5F04CF92
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xF7F3F4D9
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0x3B136784

0x924EE0AB
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0xDE818359
too dull for you."
0xD8945C85

0x924EE0AB
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0x9E0478CB
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x67EA6132
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0x8E5577CC

0x924EE0AB
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0xD25CBF88
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0x61BCD0A4
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0x70D79770
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x23248F31
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0x2C2F492A

0x924EE0AB
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0xACF5AB51
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x59C54BC8
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x85745405
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0x85FA9CDC
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0xA91B8355
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0x5912443A

0x924EE0AB
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x5C0AF9FD
before me.
0x9DA51763

0x924EE0AB
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0x147C12EF
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0xE7D572D4
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x10E55305
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0xBCFC165A
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0xA5F2EEF7
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0xF037C417
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0x932D8A63
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0xE3F2112A
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xE27C9BEE
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x8FA955A1
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x6AAE15B0
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x1189A831
soothingly--
0x68F8E853

0x924EE0AB
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0xCCCC4299
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x6FB6194C

0x924EE0AB
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x6C8BE280
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0xEB1A7ADB
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0xD4E0BE7F
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x8C2019E5
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x387B6D4F
heartily.
0x61CE0796

0x924EE0AB
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x9C65F5F1
not while he was in such a passion.
0x5EF0D40C

0x924EE0AB
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0xC8795483
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x77C5C9FA
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x70741E84

0x924EE0AB
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x64C6D56A
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xA3515249
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x0EFFD143

0x924EE0AB
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xDC8B1C26
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x76245321
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x9564BC49
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x487EEC7A
were some toad or ape."
0x859C2D7F

0x924EE0AB
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x0B3A390F
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0xFD287119
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x11D46F86
where I had wounded.
0x54940288

0x924EE0AB
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x479A9EBC
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x57B4CBEC

0x924EE0AB
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0xBA34A43C
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0xD78B0038

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0x3734C0E0
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0x40181E42

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x47000E08

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0x871729FD

0x924EE0AB
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0x407C7CB1
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x7F05E5EF

0x924EE0AB
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0x4C88513A
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x714DA2E3
scenes."
0x2709613C

0x924EE0AB
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0xC8F4CA30
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x87F58F2A
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xF359EFE9
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0x169DD004
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x1517A9A0
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0xA3627F88
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0xF2114CE7
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x573F05C1
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x2476E7FB
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x339A8F5B

0x924EE0AB
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0x90D2D93C
still I dared to speak.
0xC89610BF

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x1514DD1B
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0x5C68DF35
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0xC3E7DC54

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x1F5CBA89
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xAE0DC032
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0xEC55DD11

0x924EE0AB
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xEE32CFDB
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x023B08EB
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x1FD860E0
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x266FCE7E
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x39AE0936
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0x421E6F25

0x924EE0AB
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0x01A912C2
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0x092AA534
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0x106A05E3
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x315A5CAF
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0x69014E3A
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x649E3C6B
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0xF4CBED9A
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0xA00ADC9F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xE3F967C8

0x924EE0AB
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x763C4452
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0x5CE40B17

0x924EE0AB
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0xC566FD19

0x924EE0AB
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0xF6039E1A

0x924EE0AB
"I have understood something to that effect."
0x1B34C1E0

0x924EE0AB
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0xD98E6E37
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0xAA2E5999
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0xD5DE3083
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x60B2E5B9
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x32926789
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x292D70C6
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x4FB8C713
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x627E3C52
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x8AAB3F54
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0xC73F781F
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0xA20DE9DD
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xD35F5059
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x5602FEE2
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0xF76FAF43
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x4B8CA873
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0x460975EB
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0xD57EBC6F
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xAD441F3E
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x48B58316
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x0DF2CD8D
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x305E7EC3
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x987AC4EC
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xAFD00F77
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0xF540371B
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0xB065CF06
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x0EFC1C9F
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x8ABAB202
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0xD2BB356A
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x03AF58A1
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0xD20C13AD
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x63ABE1FD
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x4EFFB19F

0x924EE0AB
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x48A426B5
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0xD6C8F701
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0x6FA14732
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0x8D023556
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0x30CC0F6E
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0xBE9FAD39
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x73B2E411
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0xCB770BCE
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x77032860
plot against me."
0x0412EF75

0x924EE0AB
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0x972BB479
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0x06A7E049
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xB869E88C
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0xDC6EFACD
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0xF112CBCF
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0x0180B63E
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x1A1E2C22
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x0492EE01
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x55A1C813
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0xD027A4E7
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0xAE762785
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x5988DB7D
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0xBA16161D
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x28859B63
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0xEC854334

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x0DC0CCF5
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x09C60AC9
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0xD2448083
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0x45763C26
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0xEC0D55DD
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0xE5B4DD36
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x9D5CD193
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0xA1755B33
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x565F7543
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0x880ECA8D

0x924EE0AB
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0x9418AB66
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0x47950E48
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x5FCECEF0
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0xED71F1C8
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x789AD547
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0xACBBBFDD
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0x7BD2B1D3
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0x78F5B993

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xE5E0FEF7

0x924EE0AB
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0xDB418B3A
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0x8B7BE8C3
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0x514848EA
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0xAC164174
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0xD1E9C063
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0x4EC84D0A
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xD838B61B
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0xAB8BC3E7
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0x461D53EA
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x298EC426
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0x44558EF9

0x924EE0AB
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0xB787F8E8

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0x090259D2
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0x01A5607E
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0xF82FBA0F
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x1D2D62D9
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x53592786
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0xF016CF99
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x52BB04AE
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x29F624DA
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x881C21E9
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x0A08D79E
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xE737E7A1
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x5A072075
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x21D37A17
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0x69D14224

0x924EE0AB
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0xBEE16B90
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0x260FDEF8
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0xBE03AD54
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0xE5793859
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x66965B74
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0x81144453
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0x0562BD65
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x359DA4AE
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0x0DF7F787
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0xEE15E35C
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x4350B2B2
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0xB6C40C94
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xA23E0AAF
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xE0093F97
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0xAF5DF325
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
0xB2BCC8DF

0x924EE0AB
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0x3A7054C5
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0xF600E6B4
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0xB56F4209
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0x9F3A6159
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x7D1AA3EE
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0xCFDF213B

0x924EE0AB
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0x0E3FC6AC
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0xC9293572
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0x1FB8B4A3
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0xA0E45913
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0x0FD3A9B4

0x924EE0AB
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0x8FBC6D64
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0x962151E7
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0x32500262
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0x9DC4956B
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0x739B28FB
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0x5696C2B8
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0x319658BF
follow.
0x780A7455

0x924EE0AB
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0x55AB330A
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x71D956F7
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0xAB595E02
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0x5043199A
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0xFAC5541F
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0xFBD0069C
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0x537AB6BB

0x924EE0AB
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0xFDBAB1A9
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0xC240856C
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0xE4367926
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0xDCEB9C17
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0x4565A4B7
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0xCA227060
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0x3CA4A736
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0x9F165A86
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0xE9FCC39D
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0x1625A1AE
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0xD35D72F1
and leave her.'
0xB1351685

0x924EE0AB
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0xDCC4AD24
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0xD7A33A09
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0x6798FE4A
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0x0667D335
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x726248E9
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0xC4701AA3
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x8D278F12
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0x40402FCA
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0xB31ED3E0

0x924EE0AB
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0x47C2C240
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0x596540C1
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0xBF6D9953
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0x84B54D00
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0xBED36B9F
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x09F68438
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x3EA409E9
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0xABAB3F08
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0xE3F969E8
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0x99C24209
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0xAAAC7A33
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0xBDC22F0F
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0xFF4D03D0
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x1134435C
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x599659BF
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0xCDAB7122
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x383C6386
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x5B5893C5
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x58E703A7
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x64CE47C7
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0xBB2DABD7
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x0AE60058
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x7440B954
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0xDC31EA8B
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0xB57D21A3
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0xBD05F073
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0x9BF52AF8

0x924EE0AB
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xFD7B235F
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0x481B158F

0x924EE0AB
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0x4F3CE150
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0x19A5E7F9
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0xF8AA2789
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x34051D06
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0x0FA5E6F0

0x924EE0AB
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x0A949C95

0x924EE0AB
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0x15E59FAE
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0x51D9523E
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x3FF8F122
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0xB29CCCC1
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0xA29E4E21
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0xD16117E6
burdened."
0xACCECA75

0x924EE0AB
"Well, sir?"
0x329CCE8B

0x924EE0AB
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0x719A2096
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0xD1637373
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0xF1277AB8
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0x956F56FD
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0xD5B02D85
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0xA00AA438
don't very well know why."
0xB8C767CF

0x924EE0AB
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0xA027065B

0x924EE0AB
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0x76A7AA4E

0x924EE0AB
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0x2656949B
and what she said."
0x6AA385BC

0x924EE0AB
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0xA5953EB1
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0x8322F292
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0xA98E964E
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0x479D3421
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x5D9B8949
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x10477BAA
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x3EC58D02
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xEAF33D28
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x204EAD6E
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x712B4832
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0xAAF1B28B
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x6E83D93C
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x5437CA68
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x8A300A0C
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x6C131DD5
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xA219C5AF
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x1BAC87B3
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0x79D45AA0
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x29D15AF8
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0xE9D818CD

0x924EE0AB
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0x1065C736
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0xEE45B0D2
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0x8ACCC30B
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x00800BCC
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0xC3FEE835
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0xE74848A6
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x4CB22CBC
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x039730D6
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x6FDA2885
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x232DE8B2
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x599A1432
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0xF1B3343A

0x924EE0AB
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x2087BDA1
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x10C89A29
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0xD9598AFF

0x924EE0AB
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0xF4D1F829
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x758F72CC
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0xA7F7EBBF
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x134F04DA
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0x19274DE7
Giacinta, and Clara."
0x1376A2BF

0x924EE0AB
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x0BF20F96
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0xDF0152A1
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x85412855
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x2F35C06D
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0x5A518FAB
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xCADF1845
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x6EB044D1
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x44DF936D

0x924EE0AB
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0x3B80816F
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x38C4A85E
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0xDC95B439
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x0F3F3000
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0xC7F04B7A
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x384FC0BE
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0xB50CDDF4
back to England.
0xD845EA68

0x924EE0AB
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0x045A2838
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0x1799F134
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xD4854E4B
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0xF4BB248E
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x4EC8F74D
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x8CDCA63F
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x7C5175B8
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x3852674E
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x8830596F
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0xFC69E8AD
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xC22113BE
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0xA974380E

0x924EE0AB
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x50F23622
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xC8CA9156
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0x630EB6A6
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x87FBB330
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0xF6121BE4
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x41B776AE
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x0298215D
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xA3E06F4F
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x9B671962
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0xE012A091
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x4DE31AF8
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0xDA56B8E7
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0xFA389727
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0xC964D136
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0xC02F17DE
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0x1B88250B
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0x2003932D
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x6ED9CD0D
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0xF75F1F25
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0xF7CF6B4C
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x044E0EFB
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0x7B12575D
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x9A50749D
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0xBB3F6D3B
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x49F0F57E
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0xC517D78E
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x44C878CE
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0xE83BF573
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0xC4BEF9F7
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x4E8DC4F5
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xF08FAB61
out of my sight.
0x3AEFF131

0x924EE0AB
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0x43CE1C59
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x00DD08DB
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x11944855
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x933B132B
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0x96F4BE5C
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0xE93EA504
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x87A76550
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0xA7B949B8
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x0F3AEB92
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x97044B59
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x3BA05B67
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xB61E3F01
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x9CBC41F6
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0xDB9893D5
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xFE4A2D4B
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0x70ABD1E7
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x32274D3D
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0xA3D37A92
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x18BB1D2F
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0xE61F9329
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xEFC6594B
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x996A7BE4
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0x3F1C824A
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0x2A4BCDCC
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x68C38043
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0xE64779F9
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x5EE7A11D
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x16B718F3
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x425637C9
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x52D6FDBA
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xE7A3AA1D
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x067A5439
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xD294337D
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x48401BEE

0x924EE0AB
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0xC3573677
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0xF6DDC62F
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0xEB78C571
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x6E8DFE7C
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x79E04485
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0x8776C174
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0x6E490110
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x01EBEDDF
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x4BBDDCBB
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x16FA28EE
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x395A9972
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x971C1AC6
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x959ACA5A
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0xC1243120

0x924EE0AB
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x232E6DA0
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0x865E3773
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xEF5DE74E
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0xF9F909D7

0x924EE0AB
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x0AB81B31
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0xFF7639FF

0x924EE0AB
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0xE5CEF513

0x924EE0AB
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0xE3A10D61
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x3A4DB90B
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x21702CD9
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x6B4CE2BD
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x8A1DD8D7
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0x3FA978F2
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x074118EB
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0xEACB00FA

0x924EE0AB
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0xCFC604E7
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x830DF5F3
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0xFBBAFA25
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0xAE11143B
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x7F165D44
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x4E4B1558
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0xC6259513
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x0307D310
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0xF9A7C55E
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x07E06018
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x2778088A
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x16FFE961

0x924EE0AB
A pause.
0x9BBC82F6

0x924EE0AB
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x1066B4E5

0x924EE0AB
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x0603CC72
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0xAB1E7654
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x914622A2
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x95780E87
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x64C4F4D1

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0xD8F9C25F
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0xAEC2CB9C

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x819AC8EC

0x924EE0AB
Another long silence.
0x483287B6

0x924EE0AB
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xA96AE5AF
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x84448D55
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x151D65B2
and to let me go another?"
0xCE3839B6

0x924EE0AB
"I do."
0x4FD4783E

0x924EE0AB
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x91F2BC8C

0x924EE0AB
"I do."
0x4FD4783E

0x924EE0AB
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0xEBEF239F

0x924EE0AB
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0x9FD866E7

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x0211C577
to love me."
0xA90AB45C

0x924EE0AB
"It would to obey you."
0x8852FFF9

0x924EE0AB
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0xAFC7614F
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0xA7CE8777
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0xF867811F

0x924EE0AB
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0x362DEB88
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x77848CCB
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x3E7E5C11
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xE073031E
companion and for some hope?"
0x9FA46CBB

0x924EE0AB
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x15F833F9
again there."
0x655732F1

0x924EE0AB
"Then you will not yield?"
0x8C0F0F57

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x3D900618
rose.
0x64E93EA8

0x924EE0AB
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x9DD6E38E

0x924EE0AB
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x3C8C66AC
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x669C477F

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x7B7E710E
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x897BDAE6
will forget me before I forget you."
0x6AC8DC5B

0x924EE0AB
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x68D4999C
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0xF46C4190
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x26E0A1B4
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x9B200B2C
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x7EF16A1A
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0x7397C922
by living with me?"
0x26848208

0x924EE0AB
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0x6805C16C
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0x81BF5354
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x05D8EAC6
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0xBF566B9A
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0xCD872A4A
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0xB580DDEB
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x0AAB112A
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x65DCD8E8

0x924EE0AB
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x7DD1C9DB
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x30824049
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x8E515576
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x92E15182
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x465B751B
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x08786327
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0xE97153D2
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0x48EDFBA1
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x4A3C7C78
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0xEFAAA038
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0xD6A0988B
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x815899FA
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xB9C527C5

0x924EE0AB
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x48529DD0
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0xFBF40AEC
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x77A6CF9D
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0xF8DD0E7D
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x2D6334F1
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x48B18A0F
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0xE3143830
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0xCB22C340
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0x51D0F507
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x8AC6E082
strength almost exhausted.
0x228706E9

0x924EE0AB
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x0FC96209
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0xA43F81A1
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x83C4CF3A
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0xBD5E490D
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0xF0DADDAC
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0xCF61DB0E
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0x967FFBBD
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x74678F88
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0xA965E144
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0xEDF6CEE5
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0xC965FF74
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0xABF0F75B
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x8F35EF7D
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x087A587C
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x5F97EDD5

0x924EE0AB
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x3C5B6310
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x7ECA2355
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0x1528375A
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x540097D0

0x924EE0AB
"You are going, Jane?"
0xDD85EC0E

0x924EE0AB
"I am going, sir."
0x86F042BC

0x924EE0AB
"You are leaving me?"
0xBF828F5E

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0xBA1596C4
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x79056A6E

0x924EE0AB
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x93A3938F
firmly, "I am going."
0x8DC8F66E

0x924EE0AB
"Jane!"
0x331CD95B

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x93FEFF08

0x924EE0AB
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0xE1F8ADE0
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xC1E93AE7
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0xBCDD0E1E

0x924EE0AB
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x52F4E8F4
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x182B4D42
deep, strong sob.
0x66987F13

0x924EE0AB
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x958F4602
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x98F28CE8
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0xB37AF4A1
hand.
0x8604E1A9

0x924EE0AB
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0x5C22C802
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0xB12E08C8
me."
0xC9D13E05

0x924EE0AB
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0xED518C6C
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0x446C702B
yes--nobly, generously."
0x1B5CFF68

0x924EE0AB
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xB4AA17CC
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x3A2DC2C5
once quitted the room.
0x6B727748

0x924EE0AB
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x6A2DE501
"Farewell for ever!"
0x86EFE677

0x924EE0AB
* * * * *
0x239CAB00

0x924EE0AB
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x643F05FA
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x7BA1A8DC
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x6063F492
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x9AFA8F0B
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xFC37CDAE
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x5BF0F664
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x76EFBDD0
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0xE51F4847
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x38777CD3
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0xA1AA1834
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0x2A22AD44
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0xD0463DAC
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x42F0D8A1
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0xE6319BBC
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0x196A7E3A

0x924EE0AB
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0xD1C3C31B

0x924EE0AB
"Mother, I will."
0x98C08FF5

0x924EE0AB
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0xDD08E8D4
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x83ED7981
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x4462EC27
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x40B74B5D
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0xA80CACE2
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x22F9B99C
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0xACADBA80
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0xA6A58B1A
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xD3B2712D
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x8C21B8F2
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x6A76316C
from my room.
0xCB26E212

0x924EE0AB
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x67B0AB94
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x07629F3B
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0x962748CE
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0xAF584D71

0x924EE0AB
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0x5543C21C
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x02256C35
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x1A6FDB16
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x2329A1E4
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x6797523A
to go in and to say--
0x699C4F6B

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0xCC877D33
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0xB436D6A6
this.
0xC73B7BA2

0x924EE0AB
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x20300A7A
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x54FF7817
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x22D9DE5E
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0xE921C900
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x1EDDEDB1
on.
0x5E748E6C

0x924EE0AB
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0x8F933D64
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0xD90DAF84
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xA26A833A
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x60346DF5
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x7877EA5D
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x2D6C6DD0
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0xC3D4EB65
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x1AC2E4A4
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x6AACE5CE

0x924EE0AB
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x4CA44EFB
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0xD2681EFC
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x4410CC2C
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0xB7F33E09
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x33338E1C
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x347CE9E5
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x90230767
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x6C13A9C5

0x924EE0AB
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0xBCE1D2C5
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x221FA643
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x4F328891
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xD1D151BE
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x02EB3CFE
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x561E6179
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0xE2E9848D
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x3A99110B
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0xB17A56EB
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xF1432CC5
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x93184CCA
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x940C9357
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x26BF7A40
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x2061AFF2
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0xC746D20B
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x22B52192
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xAFDFA818
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x3340981D
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0x7DE2A1C4
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0xD8881D85
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x0AD7ACCA
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x98EC76B2
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0x8A9D17EB
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0xB42D416D
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x2747A566
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x0F6A4601
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x01CC565A
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x19CBB04B
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x3E6E53BB
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xBAAFC187
ever to reach the road.
0x31DD623C

0x924EE0AB
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0xA43C0D81
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xD9C29B18
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x726EAD1C
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x7338A3E7
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x7C69F521
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x675C8D49
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x8FB38C35
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x7E1DFD99

0x924EE0AB
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0xB1BF99B6
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xD365A61C
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x3E83C693
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xAA4B5EEE
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXVIII
0x5E052486

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x672144DB
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0xC9D3A07D
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xD5DFDB04
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0xB4D94DFE
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0x9A9C41AF
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0x670DADAA
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x99C8886A

0x924EE0AB
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0xFF35FCD0
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xAB224166
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x2326CA5C
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0xE2397B8D
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0xE8DBF8D3
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xD42C407A
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0xBB0045A8
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xE09AE3CB
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x65438DB8
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x9035273D
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x90C73569
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x19C00E9D
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0xC1AA2E21
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0xF179BDC7
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x0518781C
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0xA499B567
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0xB2EB83B8
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x63767D9B
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x888EDA4B
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0x3B922406

0x924EE0AB
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x7563031A
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0xBFD289BB
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0xB1EA033D
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0xBC91C0D5
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0xC09F239F

0x924EE0AB
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x740707CB
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x9CE346F2
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0xB02B92A2
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0x3666E177
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x6516E074
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0xF86EB994
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0xBE1D85FD
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x689A1AB2

0x924EE0AB
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x9AB75AD9
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x45CF261B
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x7AD1AB23
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0xAECF3D2F
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0x423AEE59
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x3EA086B1

0x924EE0AB
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0x632F1E4B
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x7B1E5AE8
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x7012FE11
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x3D7821E0
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0xA30BCBB1
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x6EEDD614
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0xF880B034
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x6E012DE9
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0xC7F2A939
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xE98FB0C0
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0xBEB4953D
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x3EBA472F
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0xDDEDABBF
then chose my couch.
0xC60A5609

0x924EE0AB
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0xDB04A0A6

0x924EE0AB
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x32B81C4B
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x75A2399F
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x2B3CCCE9
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0x6325BE96
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0xA790EB67

0x924EE0AB
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0xEEABC857
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0x921AB438
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x1E1D2B40
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x712AAA81
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xEB0F8708
attempts to seek him.
0x5A9C1333

0x924EE0AB
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0xA8AD8797
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x50B137A8
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xB710C990
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0x85CE02B5
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0xB56825A2
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0xA6E557BB
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x4014BF4A
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x16CF6F1E
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x1538DB7D
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x5F4CCF26
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xBE803C6F
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x8FC629C5
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0xC02A1D30
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0xDB6BC8D2
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0xFDE14A3C
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x920EDDB6

0x924EE0AB
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0x75DCD3C4
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0xE958D174
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0xD462DBFB
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x59E2DE98
looked round me.
0xCF8E23C9

0x924EE0AB
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x63EECFAB
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0xEC2FB97B
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x6521B1C5
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0x6C2D825B
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x7D423997
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x4785A31E
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x0B8B763E
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0xF3320444
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x72F9DFAE
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0x3D3774B1
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x5149CACF
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x2B66D9B6
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0x76DD36A9
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0xF5A25A83
out.
0x7059F953

0x924EE0AB
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0xE7A7CE42
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x8D66E0A5
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x2BB34674
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0x6749F677
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0xD28BA3A3
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0xA869A323
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x2D027E4E

0x924EE0AB
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x073EBBDF
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x8266A315
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0x4E844EE1
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0xF2184E9A
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x1C6D0A23
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0xEB2929D5
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0xB3C8D348
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x2B72B0B4
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x04DCBB56
like the rest.
0x54F3A147

0x924EE0AB
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0xA01085A5
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0xC9141656
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x3A75EC4C
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x726E633B
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0xCD08D58D
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x74BDFCE9
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x9452D92E
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x0AF3C17D
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x4D269A2A
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x32311295
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0xDADBB871
would not; but I must try.
0xB074E835

0x924EE0AB
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0xBE85BD5F
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x82868291
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x3DDB5B7B
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x68D79EED
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x36D86C78
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x5103AE98
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0xC47D13AD
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x95247116
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0xB0A5C6AC
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0x7DBC1E2E
the village?"
0x3A4BA016

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x3C2D6BE1

0x924EE0AB
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x2FEC606A
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0xAD716418
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x2EFEF6CB
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x921FA6C8

0x924EE0AB
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x9E2900BE
wanted?"
0x041A3C22

0x924EE0AB
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x893378B3

0x924EE0AB
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0xEDF5F4E3
do?"
0x8AD8D6B4

0x924EE0AB
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x6D1BE776
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0xF84C9EF3

0x924EE0AB
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x83DB14FB

0x924EE0AB
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x337CB17A

0x924EE0AB
"And what do the women do?"
0x37F39322

0x924EE0AB
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x98BCBA84
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0xC28DA69F

0x924EE0AB
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0xF530882E
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xA5B0CD8B
wanted.  I took leave.
0xD2928DC9

0x924EE0AB
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0xEE823664
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x26E08BCF
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x03966EEE
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x968BF3D9
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0x9C235412
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0x017B9487
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0xE7D3E31A
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x17D68BC1
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x17A7B3A5
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0xE996B73A
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0xE75674AC
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0xB4A55A39
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0xBE056024
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0x542FF041
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0xF7BA4D69
if a servant was wanted here?
0x1F50F9A3

0x924EE0AB
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x2F58BBC0

0x924EE0AB
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0xD6D80D2F
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0x725499C8
no matter what."
0xAB696601

0x924EE0AB
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x37CA69C9
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x0234BECE
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x92A087C4
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xFD1CCD3F
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0x364A5FD8
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x34BB257D

0x924EE0AB
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x62CA5A1F
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x8745D9C7
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x3EB4CBF6
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xE267E1D2
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x128EF3D1
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0x7E67D4DF
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0xCB15F760

0x924EE0AB
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0xE7DA7B39
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x2277CFF7
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xA0D7E9DC
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0xDC080677
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x0100D3C7
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x0C2AB93E
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0xC8F4A4E2
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0x6D1A5463
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0x22158567
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0x5568F7B1
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x56B48F6C
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0x25E58BD7
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xA1045F98
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x4B8972D0
this the parsonage?
0x2BDB69C8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Was the clergyman in?"
0xDD6920A3

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"Would he be in soon?"
0xDD354783

0x924EE0AB
"No, he was gone from home."
0xFD616502

0x924EE0AB
"To a distance?"
0x93B6C06F

0x924EE0AB
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x170B99D7
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0x5B268F7C
there a fortnight longer."
0xECAECB6C

0x924EE0AB
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x317B7B52

0x924EE0AB
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x4C956EC3
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0xC8A3D231
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x8915FDF9

0x924EE0AB
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0xA45B9B6C
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0x27048B61
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0xA962A699
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0xE2F2BDC7
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0x70637DA6
for this handkerchief?"
0xAED3C90F

0x924EE0AB
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0xDF779B7A
that way."
0xAFD30211

0x924EE0AB
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x6630F525
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0xA7CBB7CB

0x924EE0AB
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x5F711600

0x924EE0AB
"No! what could she do with them?"
0x1D93AE62

0x924EE0AB
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x7407B65C
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0x004368B0
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x0F40AAF0
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0xD6823F5C
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x781E0E98
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x26E2E30A
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xE7069CFC
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x0472B3BF
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x4E9FE9C2
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0x52D70342
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0xCFF1F756
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0xEA30E8C1
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x3B67D61B
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x38E20293

0x924EE0AB
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0xF5389CB7
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0xA332226C
said--
0x7AD3EC29

0x924EE0AB
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x2843CD36
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x535C48D3
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0xD7248609
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0xF13D68CB
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x807A2C82

0x924EE0AB
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xEB25161E
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0xF7DBECBB
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x8526116E
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0x102E074F
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x7C15EF09
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0x791DD1EC
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0x2C4A7AA7
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x87412104
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x4FDBA49D
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0xA8B14BE9

0x924EE0AB
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x176ED7E3

0x924EE0AB
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xF4BD0C91
give her these porridge."
0x669EC893

0x924EE0AB
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x612DB0D5
pig doesn't want it."
0xB063F0BB

0x924EE0AB
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0xE927FCA5
ravenously.
0x1611C566

0x924EE0AB
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x532D1950
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x29E25C39

0x924EE0AB
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x4B44D277
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x73F9F11D
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0xE3B7A33E
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x21B8963D
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0x3867BADA
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xC88A2C94
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x82E3A80E
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0x9E25FC17
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x3690AA00
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0xFB234827
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0xFACBA8FB

0x924EE0AB
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0xA1BC6D50
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x430F0AA7
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x466E978E
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x0F7FDA0A
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x43E26980
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x0AEBF67F

0x924EE0AB
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x9C8030B4
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x900A31B4
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0x06F5407D
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0xBFFEB1CD
grave."
0x9E94743C

0x924EE0AB
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0x10EA5D2A
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x0045D625
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0xFAC8F02F
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x8D6C0ADA
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0x705E1FA9
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0x5F7A68C2
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x4A46DE81

0x924EE0AB
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xCD300EE2
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0xB0B7D272
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x7EDA744F
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x913BB817
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0xD7C17894
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0xF2DE133D
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0x703DB82E
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x5D436196
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x96C3B71E
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0x410B039C
it shut in my face."
0x0AACC97A

0x924EE0AB
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0x526529EE
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0xE3259398
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x3BE2C514
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0x12187FD3
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0xD7E51F53
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x89C48044
long.
0x167CEA55

0x924EE0AB
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0xC6C85D98
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x4F6BD807
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0xD27364D0
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0xEF476946
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0x7A7F8FF2
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x4870BCA3

0x924EE0AB
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0x5ED0690D
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0xC95CCD17
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x2034B711
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x8F1AC7AF
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0xB4D4236D
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x0E378581
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x133FB953
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xFB97C9DA
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0xF9071997
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0xBA323553
sable bush-holly or yew.
0xC316FDBE

0x924EE0AB
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0xCDECF371
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0xD3E22163
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x92AACA8D
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0x4D6A527C
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x5C4765E0
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x04162D3E
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0x9CF5853E
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x374E6334
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xA0D727C7
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x9783AE13
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0x9DF551AB
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0xA588D27B
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x9C878A5C
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x95F03735
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0xF05D017D
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x44643C11
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0xF2D78DB5

0x924EE0AB
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x9F941AA7
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x757E3ACB
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x238D10FE
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xB4D8326E
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x71797A33
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x8053CFA9
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x7E221022
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xAACD63AD

0x924EE0AB
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0xBF864876
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x61337168
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0xCAAD192A
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x9D63DB98
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x2643E1EA
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0xF142CE74
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x04E2D80A
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xF5CE8849
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x16E22121
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0xC1041709
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x16C75255
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xE258C20E
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x0DFAF54A
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0xE57F0D88
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0xF312F26D
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0xE8D20C1D

0x924EE0AB
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x94C37529
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xF81FB0C7
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0xFEC1E46D
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0x73A9EE30
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x46CA9DC1
German I could not tell.
0x02A349DA

0x924EE0AB
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x27D532EB
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x703C6504
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x04CC37BD
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0xB6338313
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x33BAA990
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xBB9A6F68

0x924EE0AB
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0xBCF0B680
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0xF8F71E51
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x8030B7E3
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0xD668C3F2
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x2B77AF59

0x924EE0AB
Both were again silent.
0x926A3349

0x924EE0AB
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0xCAF3F1B5
looking up from her knitting.
0xEFAE833C

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0xC09B8850
other way."
0x74B44436

0x924EE0AB
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x159D236D
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0xDD52753A

0x924EE0AB
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0x10944F46
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x98117050
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0x1761A450

0x924EE0AB
"And what good does it do you?"
0xE7FF139B

0x924EE0AB
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0xE26AA93B
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x7CE6497C

0x924EE0AB
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0xDB9232B1

0x924EE0AB
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x720238A7

0x924EE0AB
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0x56F4BE0E
master but a lexicon."
0x0D091ED4

0x924EE0AB
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0x136B79F4
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x656A66C5

0x924EE0AB
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xFBB30474
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0xD911E9B8
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xC9273CAF

0x924EE0AB
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0xAD34C563
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0x2274A052

0x924EE0AB
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x49BF08D4
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x270CE067

0x924EE0AB
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x7023F808
sad now.
0xD9FE3436

0x924EE0AB
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x8F976156
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x2DE8F64E

0x924EE0AB
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0xB1E836B5

0x924EE0AB
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0xB67E67C8
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x3D4773DF
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0xC5D24DAA
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0x83025459
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x648367C9
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x6C2EB1DA
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x775D0685
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0xC58856CF
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x018A64D6
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x2EB05BBE

0x924EE0AB
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x36CE0221
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x885098D0
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x920E6B0C
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0xF34A580E
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xA3070C11
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0x8AF2791F
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x601B2E8F

0x924EE0AB
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x87EE0A0B
St. John when he comes in."
0xB285B41B

0x924EE0AB
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0xA6B99350
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x39713CCE
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x4696EB70
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x614BB615
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x9AFD76CB
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0x0B44A6F8
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0xA4662F86
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0xA35A38DE
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x044286EE
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x7BF4F9EC

0x924EE0AB
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0xB1D071C1
me by the light of the candle she held.
0x92CC5F34

0x924EE0AB
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0xB8E6872A

0x924EE0AB
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x4C6E9FF5
from?"
0x320825B4

0x924EE0AB
"I am a stranger."
0x4151D6D6

0x924EE0AB
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x71F2286A

0x924EE0AB
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0x9EF9EEE1
bread to eat."
0xAE1A6220

0x924EE0AB
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x4324B882
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x9796AE0D
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x6B1B6C14

0x924EE0AB
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xEDE59154

0x924EE0AB
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x756A51D9
now; it looks very ill."
0x2C3A4534

0x924EE0AB
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x76AB098E

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x2E120A27
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x687700C9

0x924EE0AB
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0xFB9D1E2F
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x9060C2AA

0x924EE0AB
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x8E1313AC

0x924EE0AB
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x259BE5A3

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x968880D6
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x4D92F7B4

0x924EE0AB
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x70106430

0x924EE0AB
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0xA0E1676A
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x5202BE4D
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x3A3FD412
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0x8D11B0D3
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0x456939B4
bolted it within.
0xC9B1011B

0x924EE0AB
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x1F13DCEB
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0x4D4B1A39
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0xCA194A8B
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0x280736B8
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x67E0C7A5
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x16EABA78
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x8B352D12
endeavoured to regain.
0x0845D70D

0x924EE0AB
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x2A239986
will in silence."
0xD67601BE

0x924EE0AB
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0x52CB6345
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xB1EC865D
and still.
0xF913F07C

0x924EE0AB
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0xA5E3ED09
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x74E4FC61
if you perished here of want."
0x66057FAE

0x924EE0AB
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x6968E674
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x5A201069
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xC4839A2B
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x78003609
to the door.
0xD691CE1C

0x924EE0AB
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x66CB2496

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x13AA19E1

0x924EE0AB
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0xB417FA73
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0xAB163503
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0xFF4B6353
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x69F76690

0x924EE0AB
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x0070ECF3
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x998E04B5
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x96E3F0BC
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0xE05AA716
house."
0x2E0E3D86

0x924EE0AB
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x4D7A0EA6

0x924EE0AB
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0x55808435
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x509CC3A1
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xA400055F
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x4530AE3D
me.
0x23A34F09

0x924EE0AB
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0xCCE8FDAD

0x924EE0AB
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0x583BB04C

0x924EE0AB
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x48F497AA

0x924EE0AB
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0xEDBEC825
sit."
0x656254FD

0x924EE0AB
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0x00B624D7
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0xEDEF5517

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x9B520281
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0x6B817F55

0x924EE0AB
"A mere spectre!"
0xA615ADCD

0x924EE0AB
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0xF171D493

0x924EE0AB
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0x5CD4EC8A
bread."
0x6BDDDCF3

0x924EE0AB
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x4FC8CD97
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x254D406C
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x8D7706CE
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x20013175
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xF50BB70B

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x6CCC9BF0
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0xF63294F8
first, eagerly soon.
0x1D8B8895

0x924EE0AB
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0x380AD31B
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0xD829B877

0x924EE0AB
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x5F8F034E

0x924EE0AB
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0xE74E8C07
name."
0x00A61364

0x924EE0AB
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x58A2E470
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0xA62D70A5

0x924EE0AB
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0xB79E8EC5

0x924EE0AB
I was silent.
0xC0D79D59

0x924EE0AB
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x7DFFCC3E

0x924EE0AB
I shook my head.
0x171101FB

0x924EE0AB
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x20707377

0x924EE0AB
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x2D2FEDE5
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xFD275BF0
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xF6537E6B
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0xE9AACE0E
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xDB748A86
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x03CCB4D4

0x924EE0AB
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0xE53160CE

0x924EE0AB
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0xC7FE2D76

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x1D5992C8
took the word--
0xF2B44CD0

0x924EE0AB
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x67E8B52E
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0x1FAFF98A

0x924EE0AB
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0xFAFB3C5D
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x2BBF9C72
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0xB0B1D5E2
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x26223C4D
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0xB885925A
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xDCF36156
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x2FA6C2A0
silent.
0x45F7BDAF

0x924EE0AB
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0x23A5BCC5
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x000EE249
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0xEBF8E1CD
matter over."
0x9A6BE9FE

0x924EE0AB
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0xCF52FD69
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xB06697BD
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0xBFE3C6F3
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xF1FA64C3
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x36B2EC82
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x025E6591
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0xEB73A1C0

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x1C9384AA
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0xCB1246B5
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x73089B01
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xF5990051
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x822A4D35
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0x14A256AA
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0xBB8B6153
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x936330BF
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x690E4569
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x6ACCE4C8
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x937816D1
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x632138A6
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0xB79DC76E
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0x7A27D08C
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0xFF518DEC

0x924EE0AB
"It is very well we took her in."
0x7682AC8E

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0x0DD3AE33
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x06B26352

0x924EE0AB
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0xD1D1EACD

0x924EE0AB
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x8673995A
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0xCBB34A92
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x2F170BC1

0x924EE0AB
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0xF9E58F3A
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0xD5B6F9E0
would be agreeable."
0x4BD9B2A5

0x924EE0AB
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xEC1D86AA
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0x324DD592
myself.  I was comforted.
0x89AD8565

0x924EE0AB
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x008D0867
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0xF87C61BD
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x94C90E13
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0x6798B8E2
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x8F9E0DE6
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x802997FA
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0xA02C680C
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0xABBB6965
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x0582E4A1
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x2293838E

0x924EE0AB
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x127BE593
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0x1C0B119F
her permanently."
0xCBCFF86A

0x924EE0AB
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x4D97CFFA
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0x112FA598
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0xC2F7B467
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0xFFAEC4FC
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0x9CFD3A40
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x242B3A51

0x924EE0AB
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x2781F9FB

0x924EE0AB
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x4E87B137
are quite wanting in those features."
0x0D7F10B5

0x924EE0AB
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xE0DBED77
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x10C25E62
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0x01A7ED52
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x20CA50CD
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x936F26F4
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0x49BA8426
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x7F70C3C1
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0xE13B57C3
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0xEAF8D7E9

0x924EE0AB
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x9A9430FD
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0x779105CD
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xB74C4940
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0xBFCC1A3E
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x21C7A1BB
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0x451E9238
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x812C513E
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x4BF334C7
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x4B9AEF8B
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0xA5F04F9A
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0xF80422E4
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x866C2285

0x924EE0AB
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0x7B0A4781
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0xF6C4651B
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0xECC44224
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0xEB8EAFF5
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x67EF766B
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x8047DE12
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0xCC648A8C

0x924EE0AB
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0xE0E72CC4
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x3F14F55D

0x924EE0AB
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x87865E71
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x6C162EC8
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xC8E149FB

0x924EE0AB
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0x8641E874

0x924EE0AB
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xA79F6977
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0x8CF6E116
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x1AF15185

0x924EE0AB
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0xD40E0BA9
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xEEF12236

0x924EE0AB
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0xA991482E
nor no brass, I guess?"
0xEFEFC4F0

0x924EE0AB
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x164676C5
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0xBAB3675D

0x924EE0AB
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x68654E32

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, very."
0x5962FA0F

0x924EE0AB
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x2AB7746C

0x924EE0AB
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x52838DCD

0x924EE0AB
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x287D8ED6

0x924EE0AB
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x535B3F3A
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0xDEB96B74
basket of the fruit.
0xAD3F5205

0x924EE0AB
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0xA1CC2FBB

0x924EE0AB
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0xF306F02D

0x924EE0AB
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x937E6D0A

0x924EE0AB
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x24BEFAA0

0x924EE0AB
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x290BFF06
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0xA6873124

0x924EE0AB
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0xB9C2AEFA
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0x7ED560B1

0x924EE0AB
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0x746AD81B
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x407BCC5E
are."
0x2D73BAD6

0x924EE0AB
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x9DDE64CF

0x924EE0AB
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xB8692492

0x924EE0AB
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x41F327C2
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xE799BF86

0x924EE0AB
"That village a few miles off?
0xC5D0EDBC

0x924EE0AB
"Aye."
0xC3F441E8

0x924EE0AB
"And what is he?"
0x2E30DDC3

0x924EE0AB
"He is a parson."
0xAC433162

0x924EE0AB
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x2C3524E9
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0xF6E6B87D
residence?"
0x608E68DC

0x924EE0AB
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0xB08B3513
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0xBE01A6AD

0x924EE0AB
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0x90B8396F

0x924EE0AB
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x508566C1

0x924EE0AB
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0x69673079

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Their father is dead?"
0x84652A98

0x924EE0AB
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x88F63DF1

0x924EE0AB
"They have no mother?"
0x3FA5D2E2

0x924EE0AB
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x499B9632

0x924EE0AB
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0xFD0F01EC

0x924EE0AB
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0xFA4BBD26

0x924EE0AB
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0xA660FD07
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x368D6FA6
beggar."
0xE835A972

0x924EE0AB
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x8F825D81
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0x9BBC27B0
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0xEF23AEF7

0x924EE0AB
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x820106F0
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x446CAC3A

0x924EE0AB
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x56705AC2
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x2A961229
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0x75BD856D

0x924EE0AB
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x06993669

0x924EE0AB
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x4944FF1E

0x924EE0AB
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xB57DB789
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x995417F2
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0x9599B1C8
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x8905E72D
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x8C165BF1
to consider poverty a crime."
0xF20D0008

0x924EE0AB
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x4CB6F5AE
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0xC61708A2
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x7BAE6783

0x924EE0AB
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x3FF86731

0x924EE0AB
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0xEA064B62
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x70DF5290

0x924EE0AB
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0xDB0904B8
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0xE8F54A94
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x2F77EDD6
the young people.
0x027D8E57

0x924EE0AB
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x671E920F
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x24940B3D
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x0ACD6E4B
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x91E7E2C8
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0xFBA7BA26
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x8C66C64E
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0xC20BDBEC
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x74E7EC6F
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0x6E40CEFC
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x367A7D39
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xF7151C54
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0x6FC71AAA
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0xEDAB0E8B
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0xA953D4E2
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xEB586532
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x8BAE6980
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x7FC6A916
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0xAC082E46
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0xB5D3DB68
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x26608BAA
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x3C3DDE3E
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x78C69628
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x36C2832C
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xBFF16332
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x525416AB
for being united.
0x5D4F3155

0x924EE0AB
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0xCAAA4270
ladies and their brother were now.
0xA5A161DE

0x924EE0AB
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x5D4BBF06
to tea."
0xF76F8DBC

0x924EE0AB
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0xFD71B1AD
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0xE0DC13E5
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x40C8BDD6
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0xC10EFAD9
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x5D5BAD84

0x924EE0AB
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xCD9E16C9
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0xBC8E183E

0x924EE0AB
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0xA4BA8C90
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x3D7F9BEC
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x806B1810
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0xF287A404
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x89781E23
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0x5F03B917
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x42C7F3A1
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x97A64AE7
will.
0x1EC5B795

0x924EE0AB
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0xAFB63A7F
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0x1299E5B1
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0xEE485441
parlour."
0x3F370917

0x924EE0AB
"I am very well here."
0x80CE327D

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x9A32E199

0x924EE0AB
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x6BCCDEC7

0x924EE0AB
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x1F1AD2AD
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0xE513FC06

0x924EE0AB
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x3E5DFFA6
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0xDDA684FA
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x01FFC83A
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xF6E814B2

0x924EE0AB
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x633DAA2C
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x8FCCC0A8
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x814C6C18

0x924EE0AB
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x91398172
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x26B0413C
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x7F0A5CDE
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x036AD3CD
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x9C92A2B8
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0xAE54D0E3
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x586353D5
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x8E1FFA47
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0xB9BB0EEA
and well saved.
0x089069BA

0x924EE0AB
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0xD7E5346E
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0x6E582D1C
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x54BBAFB6
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x56F71D56
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x996A8062
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x67CD49AE
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x7BCCD608
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x99BD94DA
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x3E5E882C
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x438E6EB1
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0xB5E49769
fair hair.
0x64007A35

0x924EE0AB
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x95B1A42D
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x1D908567
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x8CF86558
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xCB6BEE93
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x30E7974F
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x63BA1334
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x6548005D
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0xAB5A7E95
of the oven.
0xAD6CCA5D

0x924EE0AB
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0xB5EF04FC
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0xC024355D

0x924EE0AB
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x7D2B22C3
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x764E263F
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x425DC081
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0xDA6CE312
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x931E9490
from the stranger.
0x3FFB85A1

0x924EE0AB
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x85770A6D

0x924EE0AB
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xAE4C9AC0
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x82A13015

0x924EE0AB
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x48FA6CAC
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x002BF27D
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0xBFBC2190
immoderately."
0x3177EB13

0x924EE0AB
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0x75D575F4
contrived, unpolished answer.
0xFA77E697

0x924EE0AB
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x86433443
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x57AC63E1

0x924EE0AB
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0x76CCA93D
absolutely without home and friends."
0x92A5D26C

0x924EE0AB
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x84006DAC
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0xAD96B0CE
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0xC06BC925
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x7AE9EBA3
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0xE026A3AE
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x0A358FDD
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x2ED9E2BD
to encourage.
0xD680054C

0x924EE0AB
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0x55B3E989
every connection?"
0x27BF08A2

0x924EE0AB
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x8D2BD5BD
to admittance under any roof in England."
0xA4FC161F

0x924EE0AB
"A most singular position at your age!"
0xCAB1EA7C

0x924EE0AB
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x42A99B00
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0x172A8D99
explained the quest.
0xEC0D66C8

0x924EE0AB
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x51414D62

0x924EE0AB
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0xA159185A
St. John," said she.
0x9D90EDFF

0x924EE0AB
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0xE3E025AD

0x924EE0AB
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x3B827B33
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x638AC4C9
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x1A1268AB
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x482E5E49
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x1316A0BE
out tears as well as colour.
0x2FD2BF8D

0x924EE0AB
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x51B7ABE8

0x924EE0AB
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x3375C8C8
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0xC13E506D
piercing look.
0xAE45C9B2

0x924EE0AB
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0xB87D1900
secret," I replied concisely.
0x10D60DF9

0x924EE0AB
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0x4391CC4C
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0xF3CD0BC6

0x924EE0AB
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0x46E6D8FF
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x03FC8B86

0x924EE0AB
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x0C7DAFAC
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0xB803293E
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x3B30EA92

0x924EE0AB
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0x6FB03CE2
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x90669071
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0xC801F8C4

0x924EE0AB
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x8C81EA8A
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0x966F8C58
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x1E4E092A

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x96E8CDA2
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x80954CED
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x8BBAC656
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xF089C0CD
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x2189DC79
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0x6DD29D40
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0x624CF9F5
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0xD167DC9D

0x924EE0AB
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0xDBD1FB29
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0x39CF4FD6
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x57778C38
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x66ECA80A
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0xF08E1B2D
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x43E9D1F6

0x924EE0AB
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xAEB011D7

0x924EE0AB
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x1F8575C2
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x161026BC
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0xA7147D40
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x3D6AF046
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xA80771B1
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0xA3227702
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x7E57886D
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x59701F9D
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x860AAF38
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0xA557EA47
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0xD2D59FA0
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x71B75A1B
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x22FE5C3A
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x871A0632
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xE72A582D
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x5EED808E
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0x2C767B94
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0xE37B9029
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x0C2C721C
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x59DAC98E

0x924EE0AB
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xABF1D59E
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x3E755453
down now, Miss Elliott."
0x43FFF2D4

0x924EE0AB
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0xCD73D37C
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x454A75A9
once.
0x7CD015B6

0x924EE0AB
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x23C6DEA2

0x924EE0AB
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x21E33500
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xB6C882E2
sounds strange to me."
0xE4860CF9

0x924EE0AB
"Your real name you will not give?"
0xA61BC546

0x924EE0AB
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0x33D5A802
lead to it, I avoid."
0x542DD3FA

0x924EE0AB
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0xF780964D
be at peace a while."
0xCB1F3257

0x924EE0AB
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0xDBAFB12A
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x97C3552D

0x924EE0AB
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x30C4D11F
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x2082E9E2
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0xAF992B5F
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0xE0108C10
us?"
0xFA4F069B

0x924EE0AB
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0x9835832A
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x024D83C8
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x8C77428A
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0x48BDD401

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x8174C22E
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x42B82E78
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0x26F0FD01

0x924EE0AB
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x16DF710D
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0xACD159FC
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0xF88637A0
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0x8484D8BC
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0x21D07DF6
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0xFA39CF10
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0xC6DD15A2
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x2C34BD7C

0x924EE0AB
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x74E93740
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x4E038149
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0x8FCDFC1A

0x924EE0AB
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0xEA192360
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xB0821948

0x924EE0AB
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0xC25C6410
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x4DCE41E6

0x924EE0AB
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0xED22BFF7
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x5552020A
present strength would permit.
0x53EFCDB7

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXX
0x9F7FE578

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x8ADD24EF
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0xC0326E42
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xDBAE3F00
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x4BEB9F42
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x8091BD41
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0x56D8D719
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0xC5F66D5B

0x924EE0AB
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0xDFD03516
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0xBDCE7BF3
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0x56092925
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x4609D05B
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x31001959
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xD92C928B
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x27D50644
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0xB15290A9
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0x892C3EBF
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x50139DF9
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x18A2AAC0
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x6F9EDF7D
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0xFF93D501
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x80F586DF
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x8BA0FEED
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x2D4C9824
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0x3C5DF017
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0x25FC0A3C
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0xB73D4669
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x3102B717
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x5FEBC595
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x7AB0060B
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0xC606C234
that entranced theirs.
0xC01AA778

0x924EE0AB
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x29500CC5
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0x9F0E337A
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x5663C8CA
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x55063052
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x229E433F
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xAFB5A30E

0x924EE0AB
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0xC112A41C
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x3E958493
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0x378C3493
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x68DB3454
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x09C520E3
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x66E4DF8A
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x9918A32A
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x2A97D18B
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xB070D382
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0xEEC559AA
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x6849A87A
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0xCAD2DEBF
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x7C921BE4
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x7F3EA8A7
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xB8CEA6AA
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0x02B72B2B
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0x08B6B098

0x924EE0AB
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0x4451776F
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0xE1F97BDC
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0xD82C1226
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0xFA868167
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x8FAF520B

0x924EE0AB
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0xDC3333C0
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x8C52424A
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x6873F9D2
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0xA7C8AFBE
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x14E19DCC
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x95E22B65
cheerful--
0x35F872D5

0x924EE0AB
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0xE66B6B87
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x107F8810
propose to myself?"
0x90CE1909

0x924EE0AB
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x2FDF49AD
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xFAEEB50F

0x924EE0AB
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x4D711B7B
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x55553100
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x1C1F78B0
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x432335CE
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0x18EA5747
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x3EF8721C
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0x453F029D
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0xA117452B
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x6DEC842D
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0xDA0D57BE

0x924EE0AB
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xE6ED66AA
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x96AFFD00
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0xD180EC2A
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x8B4250F7
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0xBBF05C4C
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x720A97A1
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0xEB18EE79
delights they could yield.
0xE109FBA9

0x924EE0AB
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0xC44EF160
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x691C68E1
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xFD5F70E0
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x2E84E88B
produced on me.
0xF5ACDC88

0x924EE0AB
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x31C29C7E
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0xE1DBF152
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x851898C8
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0xF156714E
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x2C5ECCD8
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0xC275F428
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x0CDA38DA
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x766D33DC
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xFA37DB26
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x263BFAB0
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x961631C3
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0xEE8F8A6F
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x90814064
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x0DA75048
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xF77DCC6E
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0xC154D60B
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x25A58221
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xF1306A98
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xD990958D
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x7887DFF6

0x924EE0AB
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x5989A988
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0xFCDE3E30
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x5CB32BA7
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x11FA5FE2
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x23DA613E
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x57027915
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x2B0B1346
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0xF56B5F3B
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0xEE2328F8
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xB3E391A7
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x58B3913C
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0x6D4C71D1
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x23D0F12B
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x910B2AB9
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0xF1B8735E
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0xCDC1DB30

0x924EE0AB
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x5DC59A26

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x8F45AB18
myself to undertake?"
0xE8472C75

0x924EE0AB
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x7BBABD89
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0xCD41CAFD
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0x097A9999
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x8D04F0D6
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x978B4A7F

0x924EE0AB
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x18B1F476

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x26C846F0
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x7C853F16

0x924EE0AB
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x111E1BBC
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0xFBECD743
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x74F911F0
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0xA8576570
interest to me.
0x66D0E674

0x924EE0AB
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x34A3860C
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x58E9E094

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x56D136AF
you to accept."
0xBC828781

0x924EE0AB
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x654904C3
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0x438F176B
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0xA2581C62
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x4DDA67CD

0x924EE0AB
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xB42E26AB
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x9AF06A21
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x261B4571
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0x809CD281
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x776BDD9F
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0xEAE9562C
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x040F047A
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xEEC12C25
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0xC519F1E1
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x7821070B
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x9388CE1E
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0xB2A42252
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x4E6C0125
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x4C63632B
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0xD5E49ADA

0x924EE0AB
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x56D87526
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0x88B9CB62
glance.  He resumed--
0x0FD7B67A

0x924EE0AB
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x92252436
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x630FBFCF
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0xEDFB6D5D
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x8F0D08AD
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x0C3DF285
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x45D60EE5
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x2692ED79
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x65F3D3EF
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x4FEECCAD
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0x76666E0C

0x924EE0AB
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x2870FD1E

0x924EE0AB
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x06CC9B2B
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x69DDF0FD
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x870C444C
succeeding observations.
0xCECE3DAC

0x924EE0AB
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x117B8724
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0xE8A55A12
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0x7A2CDC56
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x9963AB8B
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x4D1BD4FD

0x924EE0AB
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0xBF314617

0x924EE0AB
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0xA6582061
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x621A915C
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0xF0E69B45
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xFCD7869F
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x929E3C67
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0xDAB7E040
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x9995D7C7
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0xE822B66A
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xD9A05341
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x04EDBE68
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xBF7BC384
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x381B5DD7
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x84145EAF
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x0BECAACD
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xF00FFEFA
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x194A08B0
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0x4F1D7792

0x924EE0AB
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x0ACAB640
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0x8C45F9A7
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x75ED33E0
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0xD1F644CB
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xADF9CFB4
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0xFFF632F8
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x06290A85
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0xED01B871
decision.
0x21DF2381

0x924EE0AB
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x42BAC6DB
heart."
0x935C84FC

0x924EE0AB
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0xEF87FE5B
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x1DDCEF43
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0xC3B64C34
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x390CB786
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0xF89D8EEC

0x924EE0AB
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x69F41136

0x924EE0AB
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0xE94CFDD6

0x924EE0AB
"I do."
0x4FD4783E

0x924EE0AB
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xE317EA85
deeply gratified.
0xA4D0ADC2

0x924EE0AB
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0xFEA6A11D

0x924EE0AB
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x21BA28CC
week."
0x4AC4FC37

0x924EE0AB
"Very well: so be it."
0x242E0A66

0x924EE0AB
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0xF43E3947
me.  He shook his head.
0xC2E41A74

0x924EE0AB
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0xBD9FC586

0x924EE0AB
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0xFE48DA3F

0x924EE0AB
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0xA0BEB538

0x924EE0AB
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x05552DF6
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x71A63B79

0x924EE0AB
"I am not ambitious."
0xFFEB7668

0x924EE0AB
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x6990B1D9
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0xA3C36A7D
it out?"
0xD8AAD70D

0x924EE0AB
"I was speaking of myself."
0x0E1593E7

0x924EE0AB
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0xF08C2308

0x924EE0AB
"What?"
0xF668A3E1

0x924EE0AB
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x49239276
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xF2D08D9D
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0xDF1EB914
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x8CDA1301
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0xE49D44C1
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x7DAB3D96
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x03246AC9
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x63442660
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xD5B016FD
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0xF25B8A31
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xCF13E06B
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xBEE431A5
some means."
0x32BD3432

0x924EE0AB
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0xB02E9715
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x6A2042D8

0x924EE0AB
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0xE99F9E27
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0xAD877F92
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0xAD08C2BF
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x79560651
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x39377FDA
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0x0A7BB4CA
parting for life.
0x0869BC9E

0x924EE0AB
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x1DDA58BA
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x999B2565
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xB0524AE9
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x38AEC8CA
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0xBD7D5E86
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x037F7654
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x547D2F82
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0x2D11FDA4

0x924EE0AB
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xB8F3E8A3
she murmured.
0x9030C901

0x924EE0AB
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0xF5314057
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x537D34B4
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0xE5D324C9
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0xB624D537
letter.  He entered.
0x6D0C1AB8

0x924EE0AB
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0xC78AB2DB

0x924EE0AB
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x9ABF7DE8
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x606420A6

0x924EE0AB
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x186FA453

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xD2B4AD3D
demanded, in a low voice.
0xB9FF4325

0x924EE0AB
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x3CEE8690
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0xF21F0A5B

0x924EE0AB
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x05A433DC
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xBF946004
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x54FA06DF
enough.
0x553A4B6A

0x924EE0AB
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x16934153

0x924EE0AB
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x2166535F
Mary.
0x57288C97

0x924EE0AB
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x46C24EC5
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x23978D8C
what _is_."
0x2DD4B257

0x924EE0AB
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x2F4C3AE3

0x924EE0AB
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0x001C976B

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0xA7EDD989
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x8016D925
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x7D2FC7D9
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x3120B265
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0xC51360EC
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xA47F49E8
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0xF24B7EFE
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x24254688
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xE2863D4E
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0x5C6A3B51
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0x37F309BB
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x22816B7F
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x5AC8654D
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0xF73B4082
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x59954E4E
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0xEF16A56B
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x20E440C8
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x98397DE2
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x759727B6

0x924EE0AB
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0xF50D2D4C
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0x794A149F
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xA08BE527
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x444C4468
and so the old grange was abandoned.
0xC80C53F2

CHAPTER XXXI
0xB0D6C02F

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x2C097C38
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0xE959577A
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0xEC46E13C
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0xC824448C
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x92F741DD
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x4EEE4504
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0xD321F25B
things as are necessary.
0x0F8F6D3C

0x924EE0AB
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x5ADA8558
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0xF67E818D
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x4ECD31A4
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0xB63D3F6E
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x3901F108
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x69730FEE
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xA5221D74
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x002605A7
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0xFA137871
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x824F71B8
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xE4CAEA97
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x2CD2DE63
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0xE8EFF93A
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xC8765D07
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0xA71CCE37
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0xA78BCD1D
on from day to day.
0x51084133

0x924EE0AB
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0x57B71773
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x84CDC76D
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0x0854AB98
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x59BD8640
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x63CAB53A
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0xF4EF74D5
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0x09FA0AF5
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x21E7BDEC
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0xF90F8D92
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x301C6D64
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xA9F33F86
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0x008C8AE3
gratification for disgust.
0x4A8249D7

0x924EE0AB
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xD2C691F4
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xF111B353
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0xB66A370D
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0xBE696D19
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0xC0E8A2A0
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0x106A78E9
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x8E9238D6
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x0748E691
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0x4D7709A6
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0xF28E3064
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0xF764DA53
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0xDCE0BDB6
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0xFEBA73B3
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0xD7738D26
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x8D436EA9
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0x0BED587B

0x924EE0AB
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0xF49588E2
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0xF74A8817
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x7324B045

0x924EE0AB
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x0B9A7DF2
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xEE6E6658
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x844B8D74
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0x362BCD62

0x924EE0AB
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0x55FCB3F9

0x924EE0AB
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0xAEE1B035
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x61E287CE
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0x79B5B091
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x664F67CF
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0xDB601E76
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0xA3A43687
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0xB197E496
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0x7F0DD3E8
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x1CB11402
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x983555B6
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0xED585FD1
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0xEB0267E6
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x0DE8AF2C
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0xD2BFB3F1
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x2BE788DD
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0xC332B39A

0x924EE0AB
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0x7E319888
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0x72045D20

0x924EE0AB
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x0CB1BBE2
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0xF67B5940
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x720111CF

0x924EE0AB
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x66F96C24
asked.
0x22A67E5C

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0x8C19840B
scholars very well."
0x1E1C6403

0x924EE0AB
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0xF32537E7
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0xAFF49138
I interrupted--
0x6219A407

0x924EE0AB
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x3DA7A13E
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x5C76D42B
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x2918FA1E
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0xFC3F5544
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0xC7B321E4
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0xA616F9AB
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x1A8426A8

0x924EE0AB
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x270AEDAF
is dark and empty."
0x00432B0B

0x924EE0AB
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x539FA67C
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0xC3CAC724

0x924EE0AB
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0xAD123AB1
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x081978A1
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0xC6DE25BB
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x9CD26D71
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x04D432B4
steadily, for some months at least."
0x10292396

0x924EE0AB
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x2E2CB4FC

0x924EE0AB
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x1396A336
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xFB5F928C
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x067529B6
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0x5B40D374
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x7D1A392B
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xF89DCEFC
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x2CDD5231
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x2518FAFA
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x70F83E41
rougher than it.
0xE18D071B

0x924EE0AB
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x6278C7A3
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0x602C40C4
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x1F63AE2F
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x461F8079
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0xA5CEED21
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0xE385178B
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0x454FE99E
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x523B5959
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x54FE552A
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x32BC4243
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xE1B10E79
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0xC1C9F781
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x76B1B0B6
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0xA343388F
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0xF3A43D3A

0x924EE0AB
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0xBB3ED834
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x6B4406DD
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x4F53043A
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x9A023314
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x4F1B1A1B
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x0B15DC6F
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0xB7F33046
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0xFE7DEE41
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x96276A4E

0x924EE0AB
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0xFC7079A6
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x114E8675
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0xF4F78651
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x721D7AA7
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xE57D6363
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x67D92F8C
exclaimed--
0xE720ACC4

0x924EE0AB
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x1163EF4A
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x91A647B2
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0x2011A8A4
your back towards me now."
0xA96B0DAC

0x924EE0AB
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x15925D92
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xAE03355A
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0xFD4D8858
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0xAFB87112
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0xE52896C6
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0xF49650E4
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x4C980768
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x9A71C5CB
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x35F25EEC
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x6CCCFA0F
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0xFE2AE58F
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xA1CC2EA8
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x65D247CD
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xF16CE966
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0xD09978C8
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x1E95A8E1
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x60ABA6E9
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x25B352FC
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x24E1EE18
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x7DE12727
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x54F16864
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x030D1585
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x975EAA88
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x99B0EA3E
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0xA54A7365
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0xB6500305
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0x8667BF38

0x924EE0AB
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0x62746A3C
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0xB0D6C87D
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0xDE55B82C
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x56A10499
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x0AF83406

0x924EE0AB
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0xDA63458C
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x25F560F6

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0x683C5AAE
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0xC136D839
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x457B99FE
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0xC8645698
pointing to me.
0xE3CF6B6F

0x924EE0AB
"It is," said St. John.
0xDFE1366D

0x924EE0AB
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x28A06314
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x8352856C

0x924EE0AB
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0xC5AED526

0x924EE0AB
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0xEEED72AD

0x924EE0AB
"Quite."
0xCB83F349

0x924EE0AB
"Do you like your house?"
0x33755801

0x924EE0AB
"Very much."
0xBB75A011

0x924EE0AB
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0xEA606C74

0x924EE0AB
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x821352CD

0x924EE0AB
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0xB9FBFD98

0x924EE0AB
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x7C30E1A8
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x2861044D
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x0003AB3C
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0x66D2CD71

0x924EE0AB
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xF87EC46D
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x157A55C9
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x92048C44
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x30076959
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0xA8F0FB1E
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x4B3CB245
merchants to shame."
0xF1F8A975

0x924EE0AB
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0xD388B5B8
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0xCA8616F8
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0x03C87282
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0x72AD8C65
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x8BC6BF7A
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x5468A660
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0x3B3AFB9E

0x924EE0AB
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x87B35128
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x693EF27C
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xEBA70AA6

0x924EE0AB
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0xA00CC196
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x7FCFB056
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xC592847F
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0x8D0EE0A6
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x86D399D3
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0xCF83930A
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x963FD61A
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0x61C80173
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0xD0436E5F

0x924EE0AB
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x118E8C62
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0xEF4CA030
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x646163ED

0x924EE0AB
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0xBB81FFC6
John.
0xD115B738

0x924EE0AB
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x0F0EDCDB
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x3D54EEAA
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0x615BAC0E
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xE4FBBB54
her own.
0x7A15D4CC

0x924EE0AB
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xB0F27367
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0x6AAF5B70
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x258FF401
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x58D15DD4
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x7E294980
papa."
0xDEDE140F

0x924EE0AB
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x3BA65FB9

0x924EE0AB
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x39AFEE1E
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x606BDDEF

0x924EE0AB
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0xD27C4B65
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0xAC8D95C2

0x924EE0AB
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0xA9E8FD5F
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x119B8784
returned.
0x83D8B8B3

0x924EE0AB
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x93FB011C
blanched as her gown.
0x54DE647C

0x924EE0AB
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x54FD47EE
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0xCEE117BB
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x2AC6DDFA
at all.
0x43ECA7A0

0x924EE0AB
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x9680EB89
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0xA68C7647
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xD1B2A314

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x07F94C6D
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0xDDD715E9
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0x9EB1E50E
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xB8E34ED5
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0xCBB0C936
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x7538C9F1
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0x084F3C89
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x7EFF3D65
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x36E4A6BB
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x46B237DA
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0xD0A9F889
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x30490A24
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x6BEB6702
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x690F8DFF
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xC38FD0D5
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x3B5F60FE
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0xEA7884CE
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x04B040F8
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x37C99DEB
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x72DF6D17
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x3AF6677D
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0xE5BA2637
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x09A9D715
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x4E84619C
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0xBBE263EF
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xDF18C7E0
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x3DFA7D68
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xF66E8DBB
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xEE6A5723
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x7B151DC1

0x924EE0AB
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x4CF93AC0
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x5AED0EE7
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0xD999B177
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x2F6EFB99
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0x58D0F228
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0x47AA69C0
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0x9FD8068F
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0xB11460D6
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x76D7E952
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x25A9C934
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0xE7137653
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x7A38C292
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0xAA18A497
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x8745D7C5
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x73FBDD3E
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x27781DBC
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x776D6193
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0xFA83EFF5
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x7B01F093
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xEB46F236
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x24B0AA9B
duties of the day.
0xA8FD99AE

0x924EE0AB
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xB23A43D6
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x8A273843
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x91A599E9
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x07254790
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x83A69F94
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xB8C1C7C7
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0xE38324EC
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x7029F2FB
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0xFF5923AB
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xCCB129B7
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x07C138D7
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x47170FF8
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0xB0C49F3B
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x438C289C
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x78CBC124
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x20BD7165

0x924EE0AB
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0xDC8BEB77
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x9C78807B
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x8C1D9B80
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x0F8F7891
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x97BDC1AC
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0xFC7DAE5C
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0xE13BED7E
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xE111A0AF
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0xB48C8FF7

0x924EE0AB
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0xAC2B2354
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0xFEE8245C
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x0CEB9604
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xD9961EA9
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0x0BA66DF6
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xE11D8840
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0xD2C39C7A
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x3E9D824D
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0xB33B68E9
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x10D40C8D
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x4E81BD83
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xB29C1F64

0x924EE0AB
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x8D41109F
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0xDE78F465
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xD5625CE1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xA6657165
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x5A5AB9BC
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x5B3DBFB6
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0x5B786E63
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x42DAEB12
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x6B08882F
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x185F2D0D
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0xA8F4834D
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xB9A45AFC
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0xB7F96942
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x147567BB
acquaintance.
0xAAD0C26B

0x924EE0AB
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0xA2B6770D
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x9DAB1798
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x2A8F35EC
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0x7B2EF1C9
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x618511BC
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xFE456696

0x924EE0AB
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x6913D8C8
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x02223F8D
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x6B459096
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0xE73C77BA
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0xEAB32967
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0xCAE5EBF6
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0xF4B936DE
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0xA8AC8128

0x924EE0AB
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0xB0C5FEF6
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0xFA4E7D10
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x0EAF8E4E

0x924EE0AB
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x9BAE494F
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0x637744FF
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0x7011C83A
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x903F835E
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x6C4511CC
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0x6A82FE2A
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x8066E0F7
day.
0xAB9E33F1

0x924EE0AB
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0x0ED3F1D3
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xF923DFA4
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0xFF1CD86D
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x91CE6981
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x5F5DFB40
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x1D14CF93
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x43216688
Hall.
0xED647448

0x924EE0AB
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0xEAFEAAB1
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x40BF2543
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x16A8DAFB
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0x578337D3
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x59EDFCE6
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0xA493E1A7
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0xE73AACFB

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xFAAF4178
high family, papa."
0x6E7E7BC4

0x924EE0AB
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x04CB66D0
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xD6A02741
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x2F1212E7
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xF3CFF033
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xEE319CB1
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0xD29FF9BC
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0x108C8A9F
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0xDA943AC5
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x692C71AB
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x7BD6A225
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x1A2F0980
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xE1405181

0x924EE0AB
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0x8BD0A2A9
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x35D5A48C
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x7C695547
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x223B49E2
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0xB192BB14

0x924EE0AB
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x00B786E8
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x043004BD
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0xC33A082E
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x10CEA4FD
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0xD8472DF3
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x9EEB67BE
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0xD769074D
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0x2C585818
Rivers.
0x970FC64E

0x924EE0AB
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0xD4B45EAF
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x2DDCCE54
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0x860FC15E
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xC9BD2D9A
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x68E2D2E2
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x30FBB131
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x4B729793
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0xAB1E3E9D
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xC213B511
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x6EA3C9D4
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0xECCDDD26
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x9C2036A0
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0xC229959F
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0xB3AE7486
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0x5230800E
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0xD6496621

0x924EE0AB
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0xDF7EAA57
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x992612FD
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xA178AA1A
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0xD4221CF3
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x06400473
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0x5F56B78D
him some good, if I could.
0xEEDDBDFE

0x924EE0AB
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0x8A69084D
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x17A1ECA5
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0xD72ABC7A
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x64591D03
him talk."
0x2D7B8F8A

0x924EE0AB
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x55C8A2C7
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x1E4FDB92
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0x0A54F66B
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x75ADBACB
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x6A1677A1
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x6D1C8DF6

0x924EE0AB
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0x7A628841

0x924EE0AB
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0x922D57F0

0x924EE0AB
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x9DF1371A

0x924EE0AB
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0xE86BD945
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xDCB339CA
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xED26A667
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x6AF4F0BB
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xF804CB39
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xDF0F221D

0x924EE0AB
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x938FB152
graceful and correct drawing."
0x3B0A2324

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x7A2FE842
like?"
0x8E391A3B

0x924EE0AB
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0xB6B6D69D

0x924EE0AB
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x1C149838
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x92FD210D
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x9C36710F
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x6DF9E074
deem worthless."
0xC1052600

0x924EE0AB
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0x9FB3CACF
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0xC513BFA7
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x0D27337B
smiles!"
0xB59568FB

0x924EE0AB
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x624EC001
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xE639DA4A
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x964AF7B1
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x5706D527

0x924EE0AB
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0x6F4ED0F6
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0xA1E09B42

0x924EE0AB
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0xB4A44D82
or wise is another question."
0x34DBA543

0x924EE0AB
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x012604FD
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0x2ED6B2FB
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0xEF1DE0BE
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x4488EA5D
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xE0A56052
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x341CD0AC
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x0F01A09A

0x924EE0AB
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0xD7D79E27
take to yourself the original at once."
0xFAB38565

0x924EE0AB
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0xD6F37E06
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x1226802E
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0xADE99DE7
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x8B8DD1E8
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0x077B1861
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x960789AE
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x064A921B
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x381BEA2A
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x9FF4A9B5
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x51C7864E

0x924EE0AB
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x7A3A9453
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xFAED6B7A
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0xF679CC64
ought to marry her."
0x8532B222

0x924EE0AB
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0xBF2B3C9E

0x924EE0AB
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x478814C7
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0x6EA07D89
often."
0x9FB1A2D7

0x924EE0AB
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0xFCBA22EE
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0x8814229B
the table to measure the time.
0xFBE0EE64

0x924EE0AB
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x6A1F4739
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x21D226DA
fetter your heart?"
0xCFD38E9C

0x924EE0AB
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x27523883
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x2A1E0EDB
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0xF935BD03
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0xDE4CD88E
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x335518C1
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0xCE384158
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x2D2112AF
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x1384E33A
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x520F621A
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x10F8BD95
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0x16546CAA
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x2AE535BA
time I marked pass in peace."
0x28BCD2BD

0x924EE0AB
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x693C72C9
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xFF59E03E
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x76B566E1

0x924EE0AB
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0x4CA0A734
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x5D65C5AC
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x70FFE821
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x0840507A
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0xE4C1DBDD

0x924EE0AB
I gazed at him in wonder.
0xD92ED3F1

0x924EE0AB
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0xD9F2B88A
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x15134DAA
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0x9767DDB6
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0xEFB8BE17
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x15A28C96
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0xB60DAC79
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x81CC2548

0x924EE0AB
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0xC1DCB03A

0x924EE0AB
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x187263C4
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x091693C5
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xBBBFA1D2
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x6F6CBB3A
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x99153760

0x924EE0AB
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0x9C115933

0x924EE0AB
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x72C95830
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0x491A20C0
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0xB051D47C
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0x89ED17E1
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0xA93E7425
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0x3B3A3D63
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0x202B90D7
live for."
0xC25EB979

0x924EE0AB
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x3C1A883B
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x5B2CB4EE

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x198F0179
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0xA63F794F
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x88BAEA9E
should do."
0x86237EC1

0x924EE0AB
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0xE2168736
wasting away."
0x6372A54D

0x924EE0AB
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x0E4BED5D
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x2F8A0D8F
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x6ADAF8B1
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xA6C2AE3B
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x138243FF

0x924EE0AB
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x00A9928E
schoolroom."
0xF9DBCE4B

0x924EE0AB
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x9330C14D
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0xEB02953E
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x1EAD11D0
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0x296497FC
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x7C3F7A7D
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x6903C3AF

0x924EE0AB
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x6D02F6F8
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0xEAA09254
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xFC282335
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x94914052
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x6C686D2C
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x90A05885
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x43951D5A
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x0BD0AD64
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0xB2E300BC

0x924EE0AB
I smiled incredulously.
0xC047B2F1

0x924EE0AB
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0xC1FB1AD9
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0xDE677183
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x60D6887B
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x16325270
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x00BC15C2
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0xE8A81113
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x6410E88A
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0x123BC405
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x49438757
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0xFB6CD527
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x067D30A1
still suffer."
0x375A3230

0x924EE0AB
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x428E6E34

0x924EE0AB
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0xD9664DBF
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x0A82A1AF
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0xEFCF6485
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0xCDA613FC
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x651C9490
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x6B2313AC
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x2588A1C4
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0x4D0C6D58
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x10B82D64
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x1FF741CD
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x314A4E09
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x063BEC01
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0xA4BA876F
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x7E7071A7

0x924EE0AB
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0xE36769B0
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x2A6A1436

0x924EE0AB
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x72D4F013
World, indeed!"
0xB9625BAD

0x924EE0AB
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x8AD8B19A

0x924EE0AB
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x412E5A68

0x924EE0AB
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0xEAB7AD39
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0xE643C891
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x84EF9103
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x5F625313
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0xEE2F0C58
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x5EC30BD6
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x902ADC9E
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0xB527B29E
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x97C88127

0x924EE0AB
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0xEFD7DD7F

0x924EE0AB
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0xAEF587EA
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x2BE02A5A
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x2AB309CD

0x924EE0AB
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xB5649199
globe, however!"
0xDB2188C2

0x924EE0AB
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x68EFE0CC
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x65E786DF
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0xD9AE415F
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x7C6A8805
forgot it.
0x79352ADB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXXIII
0x7F9A631A

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x6CE9738C
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x0926BD8E
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0xF52F0BDA
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0xCE069A2C
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x1C606E81
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xC55B91D2
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0x7B6DA22C

0x924EE0AB
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0x692C11EA
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x81F6C13F
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x0DD46DC8
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xD9D3FE5F
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x2DD1C996
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x66887601

0x924EE0AB
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x1F6FE915

0x924EE0AB
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x4B74FC88
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xF5805702
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0x5295EF44
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x41672A04
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0xDAC273F7
vale that night.
0x7C24D0CB

0x924EE0AB
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0xD47CEE01

0x924EE0AB
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0xB07DB7A9
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0xDF59ED93
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0x65D7A7C6
boots.
0x4AAC51CF

0x924EE0AB
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x39C9717B
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0xCEF7D066
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0xAE1C9B47
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xC81C637F

0x924EE0AB
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x59B9B90F

0x924EE0AB
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0xF30F86E5
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x3FE7991E
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x1C0BB2BA
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x46D975DD
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x39965052

0x924EE0AB
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0xD74E8416
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0xE7892F61
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0xC2495DE7
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x8322715F
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x10683CC2
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0xDFE5A7B0
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0x40560C62
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xE2C0D984
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x53459A63
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xDC80F22D
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0xF8D6D799

0x924EE0AB
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x4BB0C462
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xFE169A7C
health."
0x75AB3771

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x043DD7D4
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x7E400FFB

0x924EE0AB
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0x784964FD
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x08173E74
silenced.
0x60CCA757

0x924EE0AB
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x30467DA1
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0xF6C7CF78
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x29CF0281
was behind him.
0xCDF6CCA5

0x924EE0AB
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0xF8859228

0x924EE0AB
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0xF01F91B8
alone now, and return to my book."
0x67194949

0x924EE0AB
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x89305CDF
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0xC3B39228
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x610B20E9
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0xDF2F3E9A
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x1F2588B3
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0xCEB01313
I would.
0x99DEC18D

0x924EE0AB
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x1EB0EEA8

0x924EE0AB
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0x3B09383D

0x924EE0AB
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0x57EB26F3
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xF6E972D8

0x924EE0AB
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x5CC6493D
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0xFAF34759
and my scholars.
0xA474FE72

0x924EE0AB
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0xFB73A912
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0xC66816DF
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0xE5F21383

0x924EE0AB
"Indeed!"
0xF66E187B

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x7301021F

0x924EE0AB
"Does he?"
0x6DB69D05

0x924EE0AB
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x977D7538

0x924EE0AB
"I know."
0x045E23DA

0x924EE0AB
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x507B6417

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"Whose, then?"
0x757EF770

0x924EE0AB
"His daughter's, I think."
0x837A00A4

0x924EE0AB
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0xFA62DC33

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x94A077B3
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0xD1176EF8

0x924EE0AB
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0xD62DB4A7

0x924EE0AB
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xFB681CC2

0x924EE0AB
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x4032F922
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x994BE4A1
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0xA8AE48A5
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x339F1798
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0xBF2C797E
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0xCD501A22
trite or novel, it is short.
0x422E9989

0x924EE0AB
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x75DD70C4
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0xD389A4AA
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x1E11F2BF
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0xC7B11BCB
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x065DC5A5
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0x0F10038B
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0x7203B6A1
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xF85C74EF
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0xEF37FEA4
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0xAAD50D09
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0x823B919E
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0xE98514C3
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xE18A6A91
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0x9734B67F
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x070EDA8A
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x881D39AF
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x610CF3A6
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x25E5C6A3
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x7E900A75
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x54EE615A
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x9217A7DD
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x394FAB80
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0x45EF27F0
Rochester."
0x3B069258

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x3C5EDCBC

0x924EE0AB
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0x50D15AEF
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0xA5F67383
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xECB554AA
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0xE7A6CD11
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0x3A5634B1
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x529673DC
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xB1140EB9
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0xB081CB49
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0xB30B05B0
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x628663AD
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x8BC85813
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x39D9E181
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0xFF92EC61
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0xFFB2340B
odd tale?"
0x28386AE2

0x924EE0AB
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0xEEA2D745
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0xF7C3A45F
doing?  Is he well?"
0xE6ACF58F

0x924EE0AB
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0x556CC299
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x73D3B0D3
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xA5E5C52E
which requires her appearance."
0xA961FE96

0x924EE0AB
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0xF6E5EDD2

0x924EE0AB
"I suppose not."
0xB7392268

0x924EE0AB
"But they wrote to him?"
0x2697E467

0x924EE0AB
"Of course."
0xAE569D40

0x924EE0AB
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x09C37496

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0x237A2BE9
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0x03EF53C2

0x924EE0AB
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x0D03E5F0
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0x318DB1AF
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x01BC3F4C
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0x1809AE45
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0xE23EF439
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0xAD5F25FA

0x924EE0AB
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x04D5B60B

0x924EE0AB
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0x2744F938
warmth.
0xFDEDD033

0x924EE0AB
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0xE0D2F07B
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0xDC22E9A3
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x4B1364CA
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x314B31F6
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xCB5DA09B

0x924EE0AB
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x10CCA566
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0x06202B02
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x06367792
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0xF083AA3E
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x1409FAA6
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x96D3930B
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0xD994C780

0x924EE0AB
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0x59118081
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xFFF4F4CD
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x1D30CA53
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x0FB7D4E8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x8EA7B760
Rochester than you do."
0x96B0E09B

0x924EE0AB
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xA4FF4E19
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0xE751A908
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x078093F9
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x5ACC95E4

0x924EE0AB
"Well, what did he want?"
0x4BF041C9

0x924EE0AB
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0x710EA6A7
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0x7BB46FC3
that--nothing more."
0x8B6AE016

0x924EE0AB
"I!--rich?"
0x9974F742

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x2178364B

0x924EE0AB
Silence succeeded.
0x75947DA6

0x924EE0AB
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x6F2D08AE
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0xF4C1001B
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x894352F4
will and the necessary documents."
0x23B50501

0x924EE0AB
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x0F7F8738
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0xB2B68F52
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x43CFD063
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x9C479196
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0xA8DE71E2
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x229BB70D
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x3C35D65B
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0x40130696
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x4787B83C
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0x8923B7E6

0x924EE0AB
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x51F130A2
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0x08A09B0D
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0xE9A8142A
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x655EF25B
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0x9CDD7AB3
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0xC6B84BCC
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x765C00F8

0x924EE0AB
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0x1F140D26
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x7CD37422
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x9ECC32C3

0x924EE0AB
"How much am I worth?"
0xED9FD187

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x4BF4499D
think they say--but what is that?"
0xFCD7F613

0x924EE0AB
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0xD19DEB0E

0x924EE0AB
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x50A77D0F
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0xEAC8EC61
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0x5E4E162A

0x924EE0AB
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0xFFF9D78E
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0x286D2350

0x924EE0AB
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xC5AC8B50

0x924EE0AB
"No mistake at all."
0xAA04F25D

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x4FAEAEEE

0x924EE0AB
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x5902CCD4

0x924EE0AB
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0xDD8B56B8
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0xB436F99B
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x76D682F6

0x924EE0AB
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0xB724498B
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xC26DE9B0
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0xF0550524
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0xBD69E82B
Good-night."
0x7326FBFE

0x924EE0AB
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x444424F3
minute!" I cried.
0x177F9551

0x924EE0AB
"Well?"
0xB08D08AE

0x924EE0AB
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x678758C2
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x5DD32C08
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0x40178DC5

0x924EE0AB
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xFDEBD051
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0xDC0BB57B

0x924EE0AB
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0xE48D2ED9
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x61D57BC6
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0xE65DDC91

0x924EE0AB
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x7C1E8FDC
about it."
0x439B4BA2

0x924EE0AB
"Another time."
0xF9B61E03

0x924EE0AB
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x361F3EBD
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0xD997B73D

0x924EE0AB
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0xF1FD42AF

0x924EE0AB
"I would rather not just now."
0xA57F8FBF

0x924EE0AB
"You shall!--you must!"
0xF6957B6E

0x924EE0AB
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0x4DA42AB4

0x924EE0AB
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x8CC364E9
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0xED173DD8

0x924EE0AB
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0x86E62B4B
persuade."
0xC7F75C7A

0x924EE0AB
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0x48A28874

0x924EE0AB
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0x4F2EE68E

0x924EE0AB
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x3C76A7A0

0x924EE0AB
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0xBBEA01CA
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0x51916E3F
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0xF790F839
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0xDE9B61E9
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0xF4914190

0x924EE0AB
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0xDAB35E4E
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0x26380325
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0xE29F6C21

0x924EE0AB
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0xC3477FF5

0x924EE0AB
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0x1610CD12
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0x253FE8E3

0x924EE0AB
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0x74306160
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x502BF149
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0x107712C7

0x924EE0AB
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x5EB15D8F
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0xDEB3744D
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x2F206110
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x7FA55B5E
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x5ACFA9BC
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xDB1CEA5F
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x4B0DD062
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x84272A77
explanation.
0xEC65E9B5

0x924EE0AB
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0xA4F19251
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x01487D7F
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x8FC1935F
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0xE5A3D8C9
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x58F8BFC4
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x90B76EC7
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x8E9BF907
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0xC4C9E0A6
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x96FF0253
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x77459F32
against the door.
0x5B8138C3

0x924EE0AB
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xF6BD263B
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0x5566C40E
enough.  I resumed--
0xC48A2B95

0x924EE0AB
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x29DF552A

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"My aunt, consequently?"
0xF362D2CA

0x924EE0AB
He bowed.
0x4FF739AA

0x924EE0AB
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0x1E8E3B16
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x3ECB4CA0

0x924EE0AB
"Undeniably."
0xCC758A38

0x924EE0AB
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x23F97459
the same source?"
0x1847E9D1

0x924EE0AB
"We are cousins; yes."
0x56AC271B

0x924EE0AB
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xE6D58103
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0x876FBDC7
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x459555F0
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xEDA972CD
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0x2173EEB3
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x8C87EB3B
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0x0085262F
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0xCEF0D0B8
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0x605650CC
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0xDFB13686
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x23199DB0
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x9229F34B
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0xC51DF784

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0xD7A1EA14

0x924EE0AB
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x8DAC8618
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x7472718F
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x9CEF8EF4

0x924EE0AB
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x00A7027B
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0x3E2366ED
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x4BA9CFF2
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0x8BE32B9B

0x924EE0AB
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0x7CB5AE98
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0xA90B0083
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x7DBE31E5
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x5110EC62
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0x69963E90
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0xEB7D9B40
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x2C51A613
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xD203B629
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xC25DCD66
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0x06D6BE34
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0xEB382CEB
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x2F4D988F
enjoyment.
0x38B36679

0x924EE0AB
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x879069FD
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x148AA27A
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x2FCE114D
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x9E1DB888
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0x30D86A46

0x924EE0AB
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xA1ED1AF6
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0xC0831E9E
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0xD60BD605

0x924EE0AB
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0x1B29443E
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0x2D4B1508

0x924EE0AB
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x08C7E6C3
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x8DED067B
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x551C3368

0x924EE0AB
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x6AD89EA9
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0x6F516DCF

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0xE85F08DC
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0x3CA18900

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0x4E38A920
comprehend better."
0x4967D509

0x924EE0AB
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0x8E0EDFDA
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0xD4AC064A
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0xB47A5427
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0xA3B85009
fortune that has accrued to them."
0xF1AEB9A5

0x924EE0AB
"To you, you mean."
0xDA555FDC

0x924EE0AB
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0xBD231685
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x04A632DF
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0xD750CCD4
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0xBA4E2E71
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x256AE106
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x0EC85FF1
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0xE7B15DAC
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0x15E584CE
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0xE00F34AB
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0xA9EA7DCD

0x924EE0AB
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0x3E778DBE
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0x9C03F3BF

0x924EE0AB
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0x7B015C9F
the case?"
0xB5C92201

0x924EE0AB
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0x216B0C1E
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0xF96A5CF2
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0xEEBD24DD
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0x94B66F78
consider it absolutely your own."
0xE9AFED94

0x924EE0AB
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0xAE55BC9D
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xDF1103EE
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xD98E015F
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x10847AD3
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0x60D002CA
myself lifelong friends."
0xD2A3ABB6

0x924EE0AB
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xE59A6A4E
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x0C824ED3
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0xB1A3552E
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0x0739AC69
you: you cannot--"
0xF43EA0F0

0x924EE0AB
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0x67CEED0B
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x79C42B5E
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x27745391
and own me, are you?"
0x4FE97AD5

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x301FD382
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0x6A5C4E24

0x924EE0AB
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0xEFF4FA9A
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x0DF6143B
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0xC62D06A2
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x92320BFD

0x924EE0AB
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x95177E51
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x3635479D

0x924EE0AB
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x9D41C38C

0x924EE0AB
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0xF05D14EA
excitement under which you labour."
0x90A5D384

0x924EE0AB
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0x01D1981F
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x234967F6
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0x01405EF9
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x0D939E2C
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0xD50AAE55
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0x19934B02
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0xC83FC441

0x924EE0AB
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0x33B5F240
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0x29241617
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xA0E83184
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x8B9F167A
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xE768D375
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x71662EF9
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0x4F65C2B2

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0xA829CCC5
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x817D91B3
scruple."
0xC093FF38

0x924EE0AB
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x5F2198D2

0x924EE0AB
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x6E805891

0x924EE0AB
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0xB6FF6728

0x924EE0AB
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x75879605
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x06AC6523
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x19EBD589
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x8C488D46
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x526D1C0B
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0x5D3D8E8E
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x14D00A48
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0xE63B9F3E
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0x6FCD0871
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x4376537D
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
0x61FBA845

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x9D0E91A5
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0xED5EBE50
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0xA7A8EBF8
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x95C8D6AD
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xCE50794B
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x1AC800F0
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0x7505406C
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0xFCD5DD97
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x21A950AC
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x350908ED
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xB03E69AA

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0xAB3851A2
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x7FAD4478
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xC8FF0295
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x6BD01763
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0xC7A578C4
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x70563BF6
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x88594C2B
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0xE0003725
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x0046468D
girls.
0xAF3E2B04

0x924EE0AB
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x0CB95C45
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x03D5717C
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x5F353EF9

0x924EE0AB
"Doubtless."
0x96DCC253

0x924EE0AB
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0x9C250433
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xA6B57DDE

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0xE12C2EB3
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x607FEE92
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x36AF0331
it and disposed for full holiday."
0xAB770E45

0x924EE0AB
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0xF8EA8331
What are you going to do?"
0x805C4149

0x924EE0AB
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0x771B304E
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x672B15E5

0x924EE0AB
"Do you want her?"
0x54656667

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x84281682
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x053446D7

0x924EE0AB
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x895DB8F9
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x696A606D

0x924EE0AB
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x377E7BBC
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x1B71144A

0x924EE0AB
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x7BDC9450
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x6DBED657
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0xEC10126B
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x9E785285
now?"
0x7991D51C

0x924EE0AB
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x79ADC95B
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x43E1AE3C
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x85900AF5
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0x19123DD8
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x5352265A
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x6F47546B
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0x6D686806
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x864F3DF0
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0xFE17A60B
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0xC38CAA2F
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x6B4BC17F
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0x4E68CC44
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x517B8D26
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0xAB52BD9F

0x924EE0AB
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0x2F754288

0x924EE0AB
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x1F68A8D2
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xCF417F02
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x693D94F9

0x924EE0AB
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0x997584AB

0x924EE0AB
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0xA14145A6
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0x44E1A391

0x924EE0AB
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0x931BB33C

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xE6DB850E
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0xE95595E8
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x5226C44F
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x72F93E22
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0xFB39FC38
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x2C343FB4

0x924EE0AB
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x90D9DEFD
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x48FCB80F
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0xEDDF0994

0x924EE0AB
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x34838660
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xD9A64345
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0xCE353007
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x7EC3493D
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0x6E54750F
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0xD707ECED
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x928885AC
hear, Jane?"
0x14A6ED29

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0x70AA330D
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x4D3B85CE

0x924EE0AB
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x4CE02CED
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x5BDE4534
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x81AD5A8B
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0x821C0E6E
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0x7C386A25
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x822D9DFF
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x9673B53A
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0xE56587B5
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x58398195
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x56CD20D1
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0xAAAA9FF7
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0xEF98C3C2
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0x01450BF7
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0xB79D53D5
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0xF0513F4B
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x4DF463B7
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0x58950F1E
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0xE3395C62
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0xD9039251
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0xE3A7A63B
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x6641F71C
without.
0x6A49F9D9

0x924EE0AB
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x951E0C34
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0xEC7F9FB1
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0x17FAF36B

0x924EE0AB
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x99DAD554
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x31F34EDB
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0x6C4E4851
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x7661C4BE
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x5A263C47
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0xE9A5DF29
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0xC4BD442E
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x770CDD14
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0x83B0FB05
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0xA6D9E79F
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0xF1C00D60
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x4F030C5F
improved aspect of his abode.
0x5F195B1A

0x924EE0AB
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0x872F4419
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xE95F728F
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x70FB219E

0x924EE0AB
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x04C5E667
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0x63EBF6E4
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0xB4CB7A8D
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0x841464E6
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xB62DB65F

0x924EE0AB
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x73D5166C
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xFFE1AA57

0x924EE0AB
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x71BB8D3D
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0xBCD69809
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0xCE545621
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x14D97E37
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x87E82893
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0x65E4DC40
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0xDEFE8D75
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0xF24260BE
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0xCD34FD24
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x3CD16755
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xCE305168
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x8F46C489
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0xB4D7D2FE
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x337FA5AE
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xBD10BC2D
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x98385358
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x936E44F8
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x87F478F4

0x924EE0AB
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x908AFC0B
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0xEF24E2D1
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x8B3AB20A
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x8899804E
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0xEB30DCD6
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0xB33A3C4C
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x08AF58FD
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x3C8525DC
career--I see it now."
0xB7180648

0x924EE0AB
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x04986FFB
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x789557BB
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x60057AE7
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x8EDE77D5
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x78682357
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0x4A961D4D
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x79CFD120
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x8C4D6A58
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0x022C66EE
into the house.
0x12C4B91F

0x924EE0AB
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x9720967A
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0xDF44A629
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0xC713995F
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0xAFCB202C
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x2EC5917F
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xAEA9FA45
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0x0C0726DA
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x820DC4B7

0x924EE0AB
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0x06942F91
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x4FFF59DA
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xDAA640C8
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0xA421B466
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0xCBE50197
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x3FC964A2
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0xAC2FB397

0x924EE0AB
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0xCC647E0F
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x8E792B7D
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x83BDBEC9
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x9B6B7201
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x7DD5DB95
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x2C958F3C
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x43B79BE4
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0xF5D141F4
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x3EC610B8
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0xCE2F3974
mother, who was drawing away."
0x070E9C4E

0x924EE0AB
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0x8B6F1386

0x924EE0AB
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0xF4FD51CC
the way."
0x90984EAA

0x924EE0AB
"Tell him I will go."
0x9B1AD6CE

0x924EE0AB
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x6A453914
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0xE6646030
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x559A204B
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x21C2B837

0x924EE0AB
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x5EE4CC7E
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0xC7F5AF84
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x6A9C01F7
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0x95163E11
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x04FCE38B
with himself.
0x66198513

0x924EE0AB
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0xCC80CD70
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x50D72274
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0xED33FC95
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x676094BB
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x0197F74B
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x02B4559D
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0xEA373C1E
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0xB4B7E3E3
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xDF3E52D1
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0xE0F425E4
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0xB1E56181

0x924EE0AB
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x52A8AA8B
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x95F83459

0x924EE0AB
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0xEA22C971
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0x177F0E0C
ensuing year.
0x22110E1D

0x924EE0AB
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x9A261CFC
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x61DC2044
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0x5B5ED550
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x9144DF43

0x924EE0AB
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x3A00B886
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0xA44E812E
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x0CA8AB0F
yesterday."
0x38F8BE69

0x924EE0AB
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x7C66A5BC
he was serene as glass.
0xC9472C64

0x924EE0AB
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x62FF23AE
known each other long."
0xD3099BEF

0x924EE0AB
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0xEC7FFE5F
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x95A3CB1D
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x1DFA9B64
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0xCC9239B1
can he refitted for their reception."
0x1D9217F0

0x924EE0AB
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x570CB295
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x05F7AEE8
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0xC241C7E8
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x2A8CBF91
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x664DA8AC
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0xB99B5A67
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0xB0031F67
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0xE8046AD8
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0xAD10EB54
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x5CA21DAA
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x65C27A7B
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x23EC7D02
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x2BC12858
frigidity.
0x23BE85D9

0x924EE0AB
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x920D3A1E
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0xCF73CEA8

0x924EE0AB
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x227B19C1

0x924EE0AB
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x7EFA6946
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xD11289B3

0x924EE0AB
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x93098F63
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x07C5F744

0x924EE0AB
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x2033BB0B
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0xBDE5288F
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x20CC99FD
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x6E60828A

0x924EE0AB
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xE33E2009
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0xD55184C7
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x5706DD6A
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x17361220
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0xC47657CF
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x53E4EA4C
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x3E10CB6E
plans.
0xA36ECA1B

0x924EE0AB
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0xED8A79D8
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xFFA09DFD
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x880CA5E2
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x109B4C24
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x0AD07B3D
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0xBBB19B3D
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x65AA5EC7
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0x5BCEEA3E
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x816793BB
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x44074841
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x3EB090B9
the task without regard to the elements.
0x9C071333

0x924EE0AB
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xCCDC1CD1
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x35324F7E
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x52FD2646
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x6DAF050E

0x924EE0AB
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x60646DC0
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0x49933F22
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x32CA44B4
was a special annoyance.
0x637E4D01

0x924EE0AB
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xBE20E989
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x3F6EF42E
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x06C4F09E
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x990E5FB2
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x073372BA
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0xB7B6468C
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0xE65B03F5
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x3D8A4EF7

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0x69FDA0C7

0x924EE0AB
"Learning German."
0xF6525721

0x924EE0AB
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x6F615415

0x924EE0AB
"You are not in earnest?"
0x5D2A3E32

0x924EE0AB
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0xA9CB3CDF

0x924EE0AB
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x5598AF25
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x91D5C141
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x733610B5
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x3E8944BC
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x312ED828
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0x45473B0D
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xBEB0D4CE
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x0E22BE94
barely three months to his departure.
0x6659F6F6

0x924EE0AB
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x00C4A69F
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0x3A23DD67
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0xC58C7423
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x3602DDCA
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x4D02896B
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xAC5DCD26

0x924EE0AB
"I know it."
0x64179475

0x924EE0AB
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0x16A49846
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x04ABCA37
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x3E41D9D0
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x9F47906D
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0xF4335632
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0xB1D47604
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0xFFD1E0C6
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0xAFEFC520
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x2CC36175
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0xD55F5A15
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x35FAB5F7
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x9490E862

0x924EE0AB
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xAEAEB4AD
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0x5FB11FA3
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0xA6237B94
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x016E3A8A
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x1503DB07

0x924EE0AB
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0xC83E08A4
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0xAEC28DA4

0x924EE0AB
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x3EF1B954
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x4ABCD977
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x988BF26B
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x9B5F891C
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x3E2FC62F
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x4FD67EE7
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0xCCC5E353
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x8FF02900
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x97C2DF3D
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x9D85D30E
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x1B0C3F7D
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x9D9DE04D

0x924EE0AB
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x8AFD2040
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x2FF22DB2
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0x6054C7FA
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x1F4550B8
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x4AF25785
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x4BB05F2E
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x854AF8C6
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0xFA3AA122
own.
0x81A30281

0x924EE0AB
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0xEC085719
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x0942B0AE
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x40DABD57

0x924EE0AB
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x6BE90329
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xF5DB7246
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0x6CA89B60
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x48D1958A
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0x6D72B283
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x32252120
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0xA5FCD90E
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0xF631D664

0x924EE0AB
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x4EE594B5
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x68F26AF6
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0x2E7F3DF9
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x658FC6AF
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x9BC7E593
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0x8B538F37
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x9959593B
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0x20C61DC9
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x62FC0B53

0x924EE0AB
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x1F06E487
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xD55A0FF3
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0xE3EEF4F5
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x5FCECD01
then I felt dark indeed.
0xAEF1DC2A

0x924EE0AB
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0xB69016D8
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x3176CEC5
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xA7B23CB8
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x81CFEBA4
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0xBB6020C6
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0xF6C87378
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x3EFA035F
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0xD97EFDB1

0x924EE0AB
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x694C707A
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x8F4654B2
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0xD4D0920F
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0xC0D393DD
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x4A5C7808
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x20898B7E
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0xDF0370E1
eyes filled again.
0xE8BD8C35

0x924EE0AB
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0x4A0E60EF
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0x7A411BAD
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0xEA474BA5
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x3072EDD6
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0xAB61710E
as to its cause; he only said--
0x559EC0E7

0x924EE0AB
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x6E3B554D
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x00E28319
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x3B04C31D
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x61DED947
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xCB30D89E
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0x7D823A7B
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0x7FDB81C7
said--
0x7AD3EC29

0x924EE0AB
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xECF5A0B6

0x924EE0AB
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x9997EB46

0x924EE0AB
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x532E5966
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0x712495C0
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0xEC29ADB5

0x924EE0AB
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x90CE8EC5
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xC8030336
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0xE455997D
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xBC6AAB9E
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0xB9EF2873
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0x07ADFE1D
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0x3CF750E7
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0x4E540A26

0x924EE0AB
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x0A6C0497
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x1D22AA0A
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xCED4E92B
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0x80C02A9A
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0xAA4BF9C9
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x5A1ADD90
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x610AC62A
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0xC5A96AD0

0x924EE0AB
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x562D64FA
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x198B7084
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x2548BB55
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0xF856B48C
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x588DF886
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x22701ED9
last refuge for silence.
0x6D3A63B4

0x924EE0AB
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x424D053D
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0xE4E372F8
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x1F63B2D3
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x52E63378
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0xB932DE45

0x924EE0AB
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0x59CFDC52
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x45F406AB
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0xD099D14C

0x924EE0AB
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0x86DA8022
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x48AA24E9
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0x26A8B338

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x5A7EF8C3
sails on the 20th of June."
0x81CF2078

0x924EE0AB
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x217417AC

0x924EE0AB
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0xD30C92B9
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0xFFA8C044
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0xD525179E
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0x7A950A84
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x55B9A0E3
same enterprise."
0xDE383D37

0x924EE0AB
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0x1EF1ABAB
to march with the strong."
0x9DED5153

0x924EE0AB
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x0E6A42EB
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0x323C58E4

0x924EE0AB
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0xC147188B

0x924EE0AB
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0xF66973F0
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0xEF351840
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0x78C40D1B
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0x96391594

0x924EE0AB
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0x9A11FF23
the first to inform them of it?"
0x400B2604

0x924EE0AB
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0xE03FFE5F
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0x1CC925B6
rivet the spell.
0xCBA44404

0x924EE0AB
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0x54EB7242

0x924EE0AB
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0x992C6A70

0x924EE0AB
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0x57B16BF3
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0xFD52E4F4

0x924EE0AB
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0x41FB08A8
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x1B197DA9
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0xB3A58BFC
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x6122A7C3

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0xE93DAC2A

0x924EE0AB
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x7CF4B403
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0xE106068D

0x924EE0AB
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x5AC6FA7C
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0x2AA8EC51
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x90B6DF7A
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0x6D4E5496
service."
0x2F81F2AA

0x924EE0AB
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0xD9EF074B

0x924EE0AB
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0x5E71C150
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0x49E526D9
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x78D4A23A
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x1172A1D5
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x197A24D7
for him.
0x35368CBC

0x924EE0AB
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x4E42C036
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x31E501B3
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x1D6298F8
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0xF2D58551
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x5350F922
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x431B036F
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x64235D73
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x231632BE
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0xD6A4E7BA
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0xD3FC9EF0
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0x801787B1

0x924EE0AB
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0x1C569646
labours."
0x48FD2FC1

0x924EE0AB
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0xE9DB4D43
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0xADA031FC
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0xE35BE1BE
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0xE814632C

0x924EE0AB
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0xE3CEA8B1
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0xBE963D55
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0xC8E2BDD2
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0x3721D60B
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0xFC2652C3
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0x1CECA516

0x924EE0AB
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xDB6E553C
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x55D3FE44
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0xE89C91D1
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x334D7966
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0xE36C3315
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x942E5796
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0xD86C8419
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x35AA5C47
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x1A1BB447
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0xE2AD4F07
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0x74145ADC
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x0435A9FB
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0xAAA21CD0
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xE79EFEDD
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x1F2D4859
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xFF3BA37D
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xA4913829
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0x8FE1FF7A
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x33E42DCF
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0xC904F0A3
be to me invaluable."
0xDA8CE213

0x924EE0AB
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x2939A34A
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0xBC3790A9
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0xD555EA92
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0xA6EB02A5
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0x499906C8
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x0C7E2462
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0xFD3A41D3

0x924EE0AB
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0x6937EF0E
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0x736F9AEF

0x924EE0AB
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:
0xBAA2208E

0x5913779A

0x924EE0AB
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x72AEAF81
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0xD504323E
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0xC8725783
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x6D5290D1
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x3DBE8045
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x151FA648
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0xB87810FE
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x9A7FAD4C
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0xFCC9B4BD
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0xCC889B5A
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0xFC7876B7
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0x0C91DE43
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x6A3FC110
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x0196275D
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xEDB16ED5
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x92CCF4B7
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x77F11424
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0xEE85A421
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0xEDF94748
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0xA723E01A
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0xD7F1906D
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0xEC353572
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xEDC018B4
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x5E88540C
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x25839AEE
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0x84AA8F6D

0x924EE0AB
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0xCA524B24
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x34FDA732
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x498493FF
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x5D76849E
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0xFE894478
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0xD1E839A7
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xD16A0D5E
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0xD934B473
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xF700ECD1
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x4804DA37
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x2FA84CC5
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0x7D289FE8
I will tell him so."
0x14DF9576

0x924EE0AB
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x4924146D
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x2BEDC55E
his feet and approached me.
0x53A54438

0x924EE0AB
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0xE738A051

0x924EE0AB
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0xB22C2399

0x924EE0AB
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0xBA29FB68
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0xF8DA0353

0x924EE0AB
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x1B61F7CF
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x5CE44F45
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x1F6D6355
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0xBD64324A
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0xC40AE2A7
sense will guide you."
0xD64023F6

0x924EE0AB
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0xE7908BF0
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x9BFAEC01
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xCA0D46F7
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0x2AE6217D
continue."
0x382248DA

0x924EE0AB
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0xB4C0A6CF
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0xE0F237D7
have said that."
0x30BC4503

0x924EE0AB
"Conditionally."
0xBF6CEB30

0x924EE0AB
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0x34626451
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0x7CC44C11
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0xFC6FBA68
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0xFDD7283B
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x5C44C837
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0x968D0F2E
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x13B8F758
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x1925BDC1
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0xA66D9E0B
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0xA5C84159
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0x9A53D92E

0x924EE0AB
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x9B8BF891
my limbs.
0x49D05477

0x924EE0AB
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0x72F79739

0x924EE0AB
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0xDDD72AD3
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0xDF6C4B15
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0x5919B16A

0x924EE0AB
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0xEF7B493C
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0x7D1C7211
them he has no use: I retain them."
0xB56F4B7E

0x924EE0AB
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0xE5DAD72C
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x1E0ACEE0
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x314124D6
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0x102026ED

0x924EE0AB
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0x5E461543

0x924EE0AB
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0xCD314CFB
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0xCF762BD9
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0xE431DBF9
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x00B10D4A
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x3B667D99
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0xC10AAD56
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0xDD7DF322
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x6721D1DB
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0xA2DF0342
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x7C2F7963
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0xDABCC123
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x90FAF55C
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0x7FC121FE

0x924EE0AB
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0xACFADA82
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x6FF2A262

0x924EE0AB
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0xB506611B
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x56E8BD71
this signify?"
0x69D55408

0x924EE0AB
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xF25AC526
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x8EAAA4F7
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0xB99D9D53
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x6A91ED6D
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x3DB168F9
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x5E8BAB54
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x6C2E6BB4
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0xCA97EE80
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0x83908B28
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x9A415D77
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x9308AB66
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xE2DC4F5B
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0xB46B0519

0x924EE0AB
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x5FE952B7
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0xFB6A431F
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0x785F0F88
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x9D4E7AFA
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0x006E6476
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x52C31553
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x4EA1058B
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x76671547
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x4E0FB6A6
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x8682789E
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x09D00144
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xE0DB7CBA
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0xB983236F
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0xD37312CB
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x5BF15C2F
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x8617452C
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x15E7243A
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0xFA3D7369
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0xE1A2AC3C
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0xD698CE4D
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x4B67C9EC
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0xDB5F6433

0x924EE0AB
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0xF7E41E19

0x924EE0AB
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x8ACADDD2

0x924EE0AB
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x88B9C924
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0x1BA7D7D2

0x924EE0AB
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xEC10AB0E
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x2C652752
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x3B2A8361
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x7214B0C5
tribes--and unwed?"
0x7F9F9C5E

0x924EE0AB
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xDEC86F17
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x6B53F099
yourself."
0x562E96B2

0x924EE0AB
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x1FD1EEAB
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x62C75306
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x432F31CD
heart and--it would not do."
0xB45633AD

0x924EE0AB
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0xFA68AB63
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0x123FAD7D
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x9E914AD8
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0xD9D8854B
nothing more--don't fear."
0x08A2D75B

0x924EE0AB
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x5206C40B
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x8150A39E
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0xF1B9AF04
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0x83AF0730
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xB4866168
eyes."
0x83490C07

0x924EE0AB
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0xAE46CE92
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0xD1B228E1
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0x14778445
offer it."
0xFDF679AE

0x924EE0AB
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x871F6A5F
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x972FA751
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0xC5E8F090

0x924EE0AB
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x72C5CF56
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x9C233272

0x924EE0AB
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0xA62EE445

0x924EE0AB
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0xDFC5DE56
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x98D072A7
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0x94D638BC
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0xF49A9AA0
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x7F63A5EB
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x06042444

0x924EE0AB
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0xB2B9AC21
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x86020A34
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x5D4A6D0A
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xB9FA34BB
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0xDAA1724D
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x7A76D897
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0xBE7B919C
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xD74DEA48
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xEE91C0FF
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0x862BD439

0x924EE0AB
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x213E3DCF

0x924EE0AB
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x4029AEEB

0x924EE0AB
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x0DCE836A
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xB2716338
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x453D1FBE
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x95DF8256
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xE1F3F75F
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0x922223FC
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x51E1D3EB
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x61E5BA77
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0x83E62B6F

0x924EE0AB
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0x7D7796A4
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x3BFAB0C6
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x5848F11D
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0x2BB437D5

0x924EE0AB
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0xB5F589CA
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0xA1774497
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xEC97FE27

0x924EE0AB
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0xEE839480
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0x0198A8D2
stairs.
0xD7E9B442

0x924EE0AB
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0xED749748

0x924EE0AB
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0xD247B1B7

0x924EE0AB
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x570A251D

0x924EE0AB
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x409DC435
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0xD6181AEC
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x25F7838F
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x4A310DDC
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0x38353A58
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0x4234CFE2
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x600B8204

0x924EE0AB
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0x1D67AC23
down.
0xD2238484

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXXV
0x469E4CF3

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xFF2C26E4
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0xF95C3244
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x326FA32A
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0xA51D73A3
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0xB95BC4E3
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x70CB99C1

0x924EE0AB
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0x7D934AC5
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0x10D2805D
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x99288933
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x720A1673
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x54096C31
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0xEEF7BD3D
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x161B3AA6
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0xC5E8D66F
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x4EF757F1

0x924EE0AB
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x7FFDB33D
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x92CE6FC8
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0xD811406E
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x6CB55C62
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0xF913B50B
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x75F0C692
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x70C7274B
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0xA630F897
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x2A307F97

0x924EE0AB
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0xC3CC6214
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0x326FDF2D
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x60911FA2
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x8F1F8852
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x96C2EA98
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0xD544A8D1
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x218FCD80
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0xF0585086
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0xAF98E660
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x32E3C113
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0xB3326589
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x6526E288
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0xC4EB13AE
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x69234946
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x4271A5C5

0x924EE0AB
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x785DC01C
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x9718A2E2
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0xB67D1C84
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0xCD6AF755
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0xA53D1B96
spoke to the point at once.
0x6069862C

0x924EE0AB
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x6670E7F4
friends."
0x23578795

0x924EE0AB
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0x6F896831
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x5F71AB9D

0x924EE0AB
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0xCF0B5E75

0x924EE0AB
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x38EA26D3
good."
0x7BDC9D16

0x924EE0AB
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0xBA74785A
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0xEA432E07
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x29F3EF6D
strangers."
0x338A0587

0x924EE0AB
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0xBDFD8F23
regarding you as a stranger."
0xB0E2224C

0x924EE0AB
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x08F0899A
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x618DC3CD
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x54213498
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x60394676
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x14EAD251
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x113041EB

0x924EE0AB
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x3B26B1F2
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0x7B29A661

0x924EE0AB
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0xD644A7DB

0x924EE0AB
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x92F548BE
India?"
0xA174ED3C

0x924EE0AB
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xAB302569

0x924EE0AB
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0xC489C066

0x924EE0AB
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x0B0A763F
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0xA9632BBF
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x14B9B5BB

0x924EE0AB
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x9336055E

0x924EE0AB
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x6D8C2B66
crash down.
0xDA5FF6FD

0x924EE0AB
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x12EB92E6

0x924EE0AB
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x1C7EC4B1
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xED907536
You are killing me now."
0xA5926EAB

0x924EE0AB
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x2D5395A4

0x924EE0AB
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0x18C6BFAF
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0xFAF9DC17
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0x69126058
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0xDF3F96C0
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xDA24B928

0x924EE0AB
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x59F19909
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x454C649D
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0xB3F88E7C

0x924EE0AB
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xE893BB27
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x9A3FA4B6

0x924EE0AB
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0xEEFFC445
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xFCF70CA2
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x8273CE65

0x924EE0AB
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0xCA2A7A39
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0xAD1E960E

0x924EE0AB
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x9C8A9F71
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x4FD9DE59
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0x4A388461

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x44169514

0x924EE0AB
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x56789B55
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x340A372B
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x98F06E2D
spoke at last.
0x7D8849B4

0x924EE0AB
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xAE1B56D4
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x2F6694EB
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0xB3839808
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x408F4610
sake."
0x32605A4B

0x924EE0AB
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0xC448F23A
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x2BB1BE25
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x98145249
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x6BEE1098
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x5B930F1C
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x8B85C5EE

0x924EE0AB
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0xD526BBEA
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x08240BB9

0x924EE0AB
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x98FF9F05
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0x2045A02F
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x6E7D1005
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0xFF9D2A5D
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0x13B16251
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0xB7B1E696

0x924EE0AB
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xA7F671BE
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x04A486D9
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0x9CEA3E6C

0x924EE0AB
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0xD1450CD2
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x66484661
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x3B549C3C
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0xDC0F29EF
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0x8D7D7C60

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x04CB0FE9

0x924EE0AB
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x6DB0D527
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0xDF2DD30C
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x1747A3AE
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0x86647140
leaving it."
0x57DD7B23

0x924EE0AB
"What do you mean?"
0x49FFBBEA

0x924EE0AB
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0xCD62E32C
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x2EE2E98D
some means that doubt is removed."
0xFFBC0FBC

0x924EE0AB
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x4CCCD7A0
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0x85E22B31
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0xF5BDD38B
Rochester?"
0xFE16AF7F

0x924EE0AB
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0x1483FB91

0x924EE0AB
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x9192C93F

0x924EE0AB
"I must find out what is become of him."
0x6F5F9CB1

0x924EE0AB
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x182BA5EA
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0xFD4C9364
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x46D15D14
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0xD2C8826C

0x924EE0AB
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0x2342EFB4
was soon out of sight.
0x1467B6D1

0x924EE0AB
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0x91FC1789
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0xEF4C36BB
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0xE2344C53

0x924EE0AB
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0xBE797359
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0xB221907E
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x69EBB0AA
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x55FE79C4
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x09BC6BC9

0x924EE0AB
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0x0B193A31

0x924EE0AB
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0xECE8D449
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0xBDC7DA57
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0x31BB7134
Jane?"
0xC24ABD1B

0x924EE0AB
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0xC59A67CC

0x924EE0AB
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0x4271B7FD
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0xA4D96A32
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x804CB92A

0x924EE0AB
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x3944F21A

0x924EE0AB
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0xE1C3C873
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x351BCBBC

0x924EE0AB
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0xF001B9E4
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x07576D53

0x924EE0AB
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x86F4A70F

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x61536BC0
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x9E4CB9DA

0x924EE0AB
"I have refused to marry him--"
0x059F7631

0x924EE0AB
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x2B6E87EF

0x924EE0AB
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x64410862
as his sister."
0x8AFB8FD9

0x924EE0AB
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x28B283FE
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x2FB87E4C
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xEBFAD3C2
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xCFAA9BF1
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x84640EBE
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0xEF74D224
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x315D11F2

0x924EE0AB
"Not as a husband."
0x939889A0

0x924EE0AB
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0x8F261A22

0x924EE0AB
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x65B48E37

0x924EE0AB
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x09EA4CBE
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0x5E369468
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x7A6C1B59

0x924EE0AB
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0xCB88E16B
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x5B31643F
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x82A97A52
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x732A0A80
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xB0216259

0x924EE0AB
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0xFAF433B6

0x924EE0AB
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x9F3DA75A
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x8E2BBA80
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0xA2D1FAA2
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0xA5FF5DE8
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x1BF91CD8
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x61C3682D

0x924EE0AB
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0x69429F40

0x924EE0AB
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x5BD1ECAB
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x6DD51BF4
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x4163237C
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0xC8E4B421
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x8A949110
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0xAD33E717
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xBA8561C6
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x7FFBDFF3

0x924EE0AB
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x7841E643

0x924EE0AB
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0xD6B933D8
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0xCEDD679E
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x22E13A06
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0x9FE22219
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0xC3A5F9C1

0x924EE0AB
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x7E52380D
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0xB5F51559
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x3D9B120A
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x2A773436
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x71CD2985
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0x770162F2
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0xB00A5376
had forgiven me once more.
0xD8ECC48A

0x924EE0AB
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x61D018C3
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0x5E0B837F
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x805A0988
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x4E5424FC
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x42D7F799
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x7B98657C
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0xCF1C6C6B
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x42BEEA2A
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x57028E3A
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xE1FA1C49
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x5835EFD6
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0xA4553A8E
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0xF5F92BE9
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0xE7C2068D

0x924EE0AB
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0xE3E22ADA
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0x03C26080
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x08AB67D6

0x924EE0AB
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0xE20041CD
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x19AABF21
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x8CEA206A
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x8F0943BF

0x924EE0AB
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0x8EF081CD

0x924EE0AB
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xFFF22FA7
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x700D56C5
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0xCD7C87B6
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xDA3C5B46
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0xD3094E71
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0xE8C27F4D
Lamb is the light thereof.
0x15708FC7

0x924EE0AB
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0xC4A7BCFE
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0xB24821A6
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x8E6ED642
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x40BE9FBA
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x234C669B
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x246AA579
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x545E2C1C
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0x35972E9F
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0xDA30384B
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x23007BDE
could not but feel it too.
0xA045DCAD

0x924EE0AB
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x4F946EE9
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0xB0E9F141
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0x97A91B4C
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0xD1F17C6E

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0xFB691DB2
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x6015967F
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x7B76147F
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x49AA4E8C
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0xCA29C959
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x409BA105
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x5C6AD5DD
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x9F90EF20
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x1B6C34A7
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xB3EC19C5
from you!"
0x2BAD5901

0x924EE0AB
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0x8CFF2BA0
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x7A1C0AE8
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x3F564AE0
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x371AB1EF
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x9C94AC36
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0xBE664FE2
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0x26E63BD7
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0xA327D4EC
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x9E4C2E72
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x2986634E
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xB1029C04
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x74FF4F9C
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0xBCA15B7F
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x06E5A203
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x6DA09AA1
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0xC77EA59A

0x924EE0AB
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0xCB970E02
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x13F77032
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x9CED0A72
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x06BB6AB4
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x5FA6C6FF
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xA1BBD8A7
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x8C07350D
dim room was full of visions.
0xF36F1851

0x924EE0AB
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x4A2F3EF4
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0xF213CDE2
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x09C64DFF
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0x523F473F
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x26D8DDFE
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xB68A6EC4
prayer: it was only elevated.
0xD298BA17

0x924EE0AB
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0x68F33894
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0xDE651A9A
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xDB623A87

0x924EE0AB
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0xFA175D05
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x8D02D063
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x71FA6594
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x46D97888
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0xC1678A02
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x725AFD87
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x4A1A1DF6
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x8083DFD4
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0xBE9E1341
shall judge.
0xFD7CD431

0x924EE0AB
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0xA195B3BD
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x4E632A65
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xF16F1F60
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x08976CF9
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0xC1B09E3C
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x7EB5825E
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x58ECF93D
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0xE5C8B1D3
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x12E54524
bones.
0x2CFA4AC3

0x924EE0AB
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x1046D525
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x35001695

0x924EE0AB
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0xDE611866

0x924EE0AB
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0x5FFAF5EE

0x924EE0AB
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x7234C2C4
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x8DA1836F
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x33C9290C
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0x0ECB5406
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x6B3EB47F
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0xD47AC988

0x924EE0AB
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x741AF4F4
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x4C33B7E3
garden: it was void.
0x15BDAD56

0x924EE0AB
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x07E75FEC

0x924EE0AB
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x8DB7B5A8
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0xCD8B1CD5
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x855926EB

0x924EE0AB
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0xE3F4FC87
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0x6F9B886F
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0xC7DC6F8E
best."
0x6BE10D66

0x924EE0AB
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0xE01637D5
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0x5E60EF51
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x89E7AA65
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0xC0AF6508
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0xBAC6D316
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0xE2EFB72D
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0xD085183E
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0xC601338B
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x9D77DC92
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
0x43154706

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXXVI
0x1E7DF957

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0x46A84B5E
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x0F894E8C
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0xDD08FA79
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x1CA0A354
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0x02FC5687
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0xCB3EE999

0x924EE0AB
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0xF3823E0F
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xC7F65CDA
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x14EC696B
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x5D0BFD5B
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x9488A458
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0xE48F077B

0x924EE0AB
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x308D4CC7
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x7C1EC787
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xB1BF2631
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x5A72ACE0
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xB6B66C9E

0x924EE0AB
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xFB2D53D4
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0xAF3E2027
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x1635915B
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0xFBB16B01
would meet the coach.
0xD73773E2

0x924EE0AB
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0xD321F7A5
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xF9CBDF10
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0xE7448F46

0x924EE0AB
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0xC067ECB7
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x6B6E47FC
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0xF68E38AE
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x27C2EE23
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x2C4985BC
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x8976EFAF
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x080D098E
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x2ABB531A
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0xD00EC456
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0xE557EC53
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x16619410
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0xA06489BD
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x018573DA
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0x82812BBA
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0xAB905C52
body.
0x52ADAB58

0x924EE0AB
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x31223995
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x80C3C815
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x91D62D21

0x924EE0AB
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x26B53355
and should be absent at least four days.
0xE287175C

0x924EE0AB
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0xD2BB1E85

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x10E40327
time been uneasy."
0x6226EF60

0x924EE0AB
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x1865D548
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x8BD643BE
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x1E01B704
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xF9B34D5C
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0x087DBA6A
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x293AC7AD

0x924EE0AB
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x66E52D4D
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x4E3EA8EC
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x4A44E25C
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x2EC1A93F
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x8F8CD3B9

0x924EE0AB
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x19F9484C
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x62579ADF
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x71EB7CF6
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x128F66B4
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0x766FBCE1
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x262E814E
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x5F1BF632
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x82411A09
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0xC6B67022

0x924EE0AB
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xCBF7C85D
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x057D0AEB
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0xB967A3B3
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0xF5A155A5
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0x9D7B6009
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0xE6B981DF
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x375119C8
we were near my bourne.
0xB2782AEF

0x924EE0AB
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xE0AA1F50

0x924EE0AB
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x777CBBF3

0x924EE0AB
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x1F6D5ED3
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x1AE953E7
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0x1DD71AB5
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x03B4989F
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x19E77095
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--

"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x563019F0
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0xEAECA228
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x9D69C055
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x4F8BD61D
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x4C2F9149
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xA08FBDB1
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0xCC1F98CD
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x8F41596B

0x924EE0AB
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x6C73ECCE
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xF1C7A0EE
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0xFF529AC7
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0x38DBC61C
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x556A146D
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xDA62E7BB
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0xC9F5C8D5
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x6D29F0AC
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0xF75566FC
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x1D8E27B7
them!
0x0207C5E7

0x924EE0AB
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x5ED2389B
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x63A04091
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0xDF5EB607
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0xFC5F57FD
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xA75504AD
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x12367F36
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0xAAD83D2D
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x382C07A6
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x0DA08985
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0xAD7DCD6A
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x43B45FDB
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0xC0831892
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0xCD46EB2C
tideless sea of the south."
0xCF19D3D8

0x924EE0AB
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x50AC8A36
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0xFE53B7CC
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x895FBA99
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x29054732
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0xA30277C3
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0xE88A8AE4
station were at my command.
0x3ABB1570

0x924EE0AB
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0x15A2125E
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0xB1171B6A
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x5174AA46
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x8950D2FC
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0xCC93095B
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0x28507C6A
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x2504DAC5
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x787ADE89

0x924EE0AB
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x1E3F6A9E

0x924EE0AB
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x543BD569
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0x135B3A7D
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x16E26D42
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xD5ED0105
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0xA9066B14
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x2DFAF922
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0x9E3318B1
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0xC20EFAE9
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0xEB899DFF
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0xDF63CE52
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x8F462515
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x7175F547
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x81BD6838

0x924EE0AB
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xF096A44B
ruin.
0xBEFDA839

0x924EE0AB
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x5FF96707
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x4B803CB9
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x4B38F8FC
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0xC64BBF38
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0xF89383FF
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x291DADC6
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0xC30C3FC9

0x924EE0AB
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x1C2D346B
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x3339620B
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0x59339210
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x2DC6B1BC
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xC2DDF70C
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x1D59AA14
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0xDC1346E8
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0xF06B5A9F
token.
0x6F8AB702

0x924EE0AB
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x15703768
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x19716BAF
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x88F5DF8F
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x8AB54F39
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0xD2659C0F
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0xF533EBDE
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x5A4B2BB2
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x9BBB8B36
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0xA6C12C59
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x7E92849C

0x924EE0AB
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0xED5D5209
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0xE3D6CEFC
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0x09EC066A
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0x26FB6BA4
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x556C1B48
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x203ED348
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x01846490

0x924EE0AB
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x2F7961AA

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0x932C36C2

0x924EE0AB
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0x8091EF03

0x924EE0AB
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0x330C2886

0x924EE0AB
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x47E4C89B
trying to evade.
0x639C5719

0x924EE0AB
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0x4C78F834

0x924EE0AB
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xB8EB0F75
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x90736A94
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0xB4B30249
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x9B78D097
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x56AC8229
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0x13474570
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0xA0FCB62D
Antipodes.
0x551C0FDC

0x924EE0AB
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x78057266
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x94586E54
direct question as to where he really was.
0xC1775FB2

0x924EE0AB
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x34F19F5B
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0xE78605BE
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x79492F90
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xD49B7311
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xED4EE719
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0x1717752E
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x7D1983D4
witnessed it myself."
0x3893DC1D

0x924EE0AB
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0xB2CAB93F
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0xE6866743

0x924EE0AB
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0xE23DCD03
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x528BE49C
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x1C815686
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0xC77EBE03

0x924EE0AB
"I have heard something of it."
0xD7BD2B38

0x924EE0AB
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x1E291F3E
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0xDBFD0B77
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0xED2F15AA
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0xCCEEFA41
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xA7035070
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0x9CA350D4

0x924EE0AB
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x672B9E2D
main fact.
0x3B2FF153

0x924EE0AB
"And this lady?"
0x2E06179C

0x924EE0AB
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0xECE2C397
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0x6C8E81D4
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x2EB5D39F

0x924EE0AB
"But the fire," I suggested.
0xE36D9E6E

0x924EE0AB
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x78C5A056
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0xE6446E99
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0xD206FCB4
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xA0EF1D25
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x67D1A736
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x78D35638
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0xA19100DC
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x5ED40D49
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xB12D0B28
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0xC2D816E9

0x924EE0AB
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xEA6B0067
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x90DA010F
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xCA859C28

0x924EE0AB
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x5FE0B3F2
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0xE020A8FE
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0x91C1E610
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x59ECD930
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x3060CC84
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0xBE469014
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0xB574B96B
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0xEE98FCB9
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x82B3BF02
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0xC36F2236
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0x5DB7E4F0
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0x8E86DC31
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x36AFAD41
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0xE3609DCF
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x74A324AA
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x49F708C7
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0xBC0B2D69
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0x030F1668
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0xB5D3FE91
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0xE2108B10
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x69176AA5
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x6CD59187
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x0DA604CE
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x9ED84252
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xEE5AB0CE
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0x854D6E96

0x924EE0AB
"What! did he not leave England?"
0xA4DBF24B

0x924EE0AB
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0xADE77A87
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xDB4D591F
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0xBC9EEFDC
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0xFDCFA4F5
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0xB4DF605C
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x40424875
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0xA3659666
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x16BBD246
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0x543FB4F3
Thornfield Hall."
0x2370AD1E

0x924EE0AB
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0x8B21B0B1

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x3C94407E
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x54D6CBD1
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0x4B6174BC
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x6B5B507A
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x53E26D23
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0x54E95D99
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x9052E95B
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0xFCFD86A7
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0xCEDACF30
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x8BB769A4
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0xC4DDE8D2
pavement."
0x812AB814

0x924EE0AB
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0xEE8EA181

0x924EE0AB
"Dead?"
0x76047FB5

0x924EE0AB
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x484EC8A8
scattered."
0x62404577

0x924EE0AB
"Good God!"
0x4A81D26E

0x924EE0AB
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0xCA3CA788

0x924EE0AB
He shuddered.
0xD757780A

0x924EE0AB
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0x02E544C3

0x924EE0AB
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0x7A634330
only some bits of walls standing now."
0x8518CA40

0x924EE0AB
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x20FC0C61

0x924EE0AB
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0x39409211

0x924EE0AB
"What do you mean?"
0x49FFBBEA

0x924EE0AB
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0xB325B20A
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0x19597AC7
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x2B96A9D8
pity him, for my part."
0x0C3EFC29

0x924EE0AB
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0x180EA439

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x7BC989B5

0x924EE0AB
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0x3602AD02
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x145F2070

0x924EE0AB
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0x35048227
fixture now."
0x363ED721

0x924EE0AB
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0xCBFBB664

0x924EE0AB
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0x828747DF
Edward."
0x8399CED8

0x924EE0AB
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0x290566B9
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x183F17AC

0x924EE0AB
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x7BA745A0
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x08B13C97
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x10F3ABB3
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x9DF02832
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0x91AC00F5
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x28432EAD
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x249C602B
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0xF42CF381
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0xB7E5DAAC

0x924EE0AB
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0xB2137930

0x924EE0AB
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0xF1FC1F28
quite a desolate spot."
0x7462809C

0x924EE0AB
"Who is with him?"
0x97CAADE7

0x924EE0AB
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0x5AD15EB2
down, they say."
0x3B1A20AC

0x924EE0AB
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x569C29E2

0x924EE0AB
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0xB335A719

0x924EE0AB
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0x0ED25CEC
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0xD859759C
you usually demand."

The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,

moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xC5E78ED7
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x926D5D42
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0xBD46CA03
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x92E3F7A8
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x221AF132
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0xB0123522
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0xD3356294
there in the season to shoot.
0xC3A33C8C

0x924EE0AB
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0x076E3091
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x1386B2EA
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x12B63713
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x9851C488
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0xB7158A81
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0xA4D81C8D
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x5E691C43
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0x0A34A823
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x433940FF
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0xC0410920
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xE0EBC752
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0xCD6D7118

0x924EE0AB
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x9B9B6C46
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x65370AA5
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x96D28727
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x38843258

0x924EE0AB
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0xDC4A281A
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0x31E9C0F6
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x10100E82
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x9B0995B3
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0xBB4DDE58
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x1CD848DC
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x188EB633
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x681E083A
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0xA230CE62
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x5DB2721E
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0xE36FAEF0
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0x4E3F8C3D

0x924EE0AB
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0x62B0A3CB

0x924EE0AB
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x12A155C6
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xE05E6947
grange.
0x863A6619

0x924EE0AB
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0x38213E50
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x03F7E3C6
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0x9A5C9653
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0xA07117BA

0x924EE0AB
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xC8B3DADD
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x72E10245
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x53E152E2
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x40B972DF
advance.
0x2ADD1708

0x924EE0AB
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xFEC3516F
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x2C40B01F
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0x98AF8074
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x9323D076
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x69918EB2
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x4C84A529
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x1D9A7F54
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0xBA3A7549

0x924EE0AB
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x375E14CB
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0xABD52B48
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x4EE2C3A6
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x36AE0EB2

0x924EE0AB
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0x2EE87FE4
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x6B84E5FF
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xE7E83996
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0x5AC5A377
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0xA0529A1D
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x23071985
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0x3AA050AC
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x42951363
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0xD96C1B75
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0x9659EAAD
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x1A2D17BF

0x924EE0AB
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xD9C05CD6
had you not better go in?"
0xF328DB03

0x924EE0AB
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x7F44A968

0x924EE0AB
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0xAE37C0B0
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0x58FD1320
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0xD4221F93

0x924EE0AB
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0xC44CA591
"how are you?"
0x356D547D

0x924EE0AB
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x94243F6F
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0x89DA4948
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0xF473498E
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x3AC8FAC9
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0xFAEFD08F
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x7F3A0FE2
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0xA7000549
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0xD92D5060
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0xF49004FF
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0xF4D2ECB6
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0xA53C3013
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0x681FCAC3

0x924EE0AB
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0x03C3F633
to him, but do not give my name."
0xD5291544

0x924EE0AB
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xB2917926

0x924EE0AB
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x42422FA3
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x593EA923
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0xE798D028

0x924EE0AB
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xA495A3F8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0xD3552035

0x924EE0AB
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0xE419ADAD

0x924EE0AB
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x21FF1A58
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x95DB91F1
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0x068FC234

0x924EE0AB
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x13506ACE
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x2E5B9854
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x8F8E33C2
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x7A06C7B9
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0xD5B84CED
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0xF76C9FB3
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0xD05664D9
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0xB8ADC395
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x3524E90E
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x87382C4A

0x924EE0AB
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0xC7A93884

0x924EE0AB
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0xC387DB7D
still excited.
0x6205D403

0x924EE0AB
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0x3B1260DD

0x924EE0AB
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0xFB601AAE
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0xFD860A58
you, Mary, is it not?"
0xB8E6908B

0x924EE0AB
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0xB421EFDA

0x924EE0AB
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x9D497C77
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0xD27CC5C5
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x0EF8948F
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x21761457
and aloud.
0xBCDB67BD

0x924EE0AB
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x41688183
glass," I said.
0xA78D9F26

0x924EE0AB
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0x2265E167

0x924EE0AB
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0xE9638C71
evening," I answered.
0x382B4076

0x924EE0AB
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x8A8758EE
seized me?"
0xE181E51C

0x924EE0AB
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x301564F8
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x7FF57084

0x924EE0AB
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x2C315747
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0xC8826563
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0x0330AE30

0x924EE0AB
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x4A80E4C3

0x924EE0AB
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x05F6F8F4
must be more of her."
0xCA8CD3A4

0x924EE0AB
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0x11AD27FD
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0x1A105B2B

0x924EE0AB
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x186B5BA1

0x924EE0AB
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x27B05D15
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x3A266677

0x924EE0AB
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x1F330D3C

0x924EE0AB
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xF87E8C86
come back to you."
0x32A7D584

0x924EE0AB
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xAAA9CC36

0x924EE0AB
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x85A11ECD
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0xC3B4CA15

0x924EE0AB
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x6E155252
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x0B92D7BB
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xC929076E
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0xBAEE3937
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0xAB1DF4B0

0x924EE0AB
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x6C83D2DA

0x924EE0AB
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x58BF00CF
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x27A67F3F
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0xB7423B94
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0x7959C56D
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x472EACFB
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0x87347156

0x924EE0AB
"There, sir--and there!"'
0xB2A93EF9

0x924EE0AB
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0xDA992EDB
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0x3CC4FC3E
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x7F43B5D6

0x924EE0AB
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x0619A231

0x924EE0AB
"I am."
0xA131E71F

0x924EE0AB
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0x2F710719
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x3293BA6D

0x924EE0AB
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0x92B8C7F7

0x924EE0AB
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x2DAD0ED6

0x924EE0AB
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0x0511CFD6

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0x48B2F37A
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0xA5B8CA36
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x6E99C0AC
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x18F31683

0x924EE0AB
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0xE016D207
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0x6D6EA322
company of an evening."
0x717407E8

0x924EE0AB
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xE0857E51
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0xDC4048FA
me?"
0x7C187227

0x924EE0AB
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x58842CAD
mistress."
0xA218305B

0x924EE0AB
"And you will stay with me?"
0xEC7AEB86

0x924EE0AB
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0xDA15534F
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0xD792B4D2
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0x9C0B3B6E
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0xEA990826
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x743F795F

0x924EE0AB
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0x9196F024
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xA5B36553
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0x9B638F18
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x1E5B251F
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x8B8E351D
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xD18BC82F
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x73932F78
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0xFE6A1B90
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x3E9307B2
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x72BA2C4F
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x78525418

0x924EE0AB
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x3850FB27
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x3BA88480
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0xA875ED62
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0x9C25FF59
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x5BB7E809
vengeance on its frame."
0x4433E24B

0x924EE0AB
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0x0BE83AC8

0x924EE0AB
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x97FC84B9
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x1402C2FC
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0xB243D6F7
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0xE57C82AD
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0x437B2A80
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0xD10E2565
Come--tell me."
0x18F43C35

0x924EE0AB
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x1E79184E
you think it better."
0x47D06DC3

0x924EE0AB
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x3EC8E09B
one day."
0x91B4F186

0x924EE0AB
"I don't care about being married."
0x36920C26

0x924EE0AB
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0xF8779B72
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x74C92333

0x924EE0AB
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x970AA7DC
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0xCEC26D7D
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x15E690F0
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0xA7B9CD05
conversation.
0x4C902FBE

0x924EE0AB
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xE85ABE4A
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x9A852117
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x3F792425
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0x40ECB32A
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x3FAD3D04
not yet noticed."
0xB11959A9

0x924EE0AB
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0xA252A6E4
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xF175D651
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0xEA1FCE26

0x924EE0AB
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x1C749F26
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x3DDD4B89
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xEF68879C

0x924EE0AB
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x5A5B5793
cicatrised visage."
0xEE52773B

0x924EE0AB
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0xBFDD5AC1
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x6CC46C31
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xB9A23273

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x1BB6DFA2

0x924EE0AB
"And you see the candles?"
0xA79D2E8E

0x924EE0AB
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xFEF797B5

0x924EE0AB
"Can you see me?"
0x54061C68

0x924EE0AB
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0xD2756F34

0x924EE0AB
"When do you take supper?"
0xE2EB15E8

0x924EE0AB
"I never take supper."
0x5CD8EA3C

0x924EE0AB
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0x770097A3
only you forget."
0xABE4C478

0x924EE0AB
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0xB28A5947
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xB17875B7
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x44B4B077
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0x011C7353
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xAD7963DC
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x8A9EC3A0
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xD1A3C835
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x95678795
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xCA19695B
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xF4066CBB

0x924EE0AB
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x1EE3A560
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x52B26780
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x33BDE40D
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0xDC3C14BF
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x675CF9A5
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0xC91FE046
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0x049D2F90

0x924EE0AB
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0xA9F69903

0x924EE0AB
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0xFBC3FB4D
p422.jpg}
0xA33232FD

0x924EE0AB
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0xD396988F

0x924EE0AB
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0x678E810F
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0xA99D3144
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x4E0F17DC
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x4A1F4C03

0x924EE0AB
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0xB0CA847E

0x924EE0AB
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0xEE1F7F29
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0xFBAE5450
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x8D449F22
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0xF9C603DA
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x77938374
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xE801A8F9
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x185302E3
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x022BF732
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0x645D0635

0x924EE0AB
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x85CCB9B8
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x862F4246
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xB074914A
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x193B8D9A
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0x23B56378

0x924EE0AB
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0x8F744F1F
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0x17508C08
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0xB2EA8D75
undiscoverable?
0x0683B2A3

0x924EE0AB
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0x4AF50943

0x924EE0AB
"What for, Jane?"
0xB160E495

0x924EE0AB
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0x41D69329
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x44E22A70
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x1FE607AD

0x924EE0AB
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0xB414E156

0x924EE0AB
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x5465B691

0x924EE0AB
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0x90E5E001
sojourned."
0x6A4F339C

0x924EE0AB
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0xBB571A1D
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0x4B75BEE7
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0x7933F3E4

0x924EE0AB
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0xD1477724

0x924EE0AB
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0x9B11C180
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0xA4B61F7F
substantiality."
0x545504F8

0x924EE0AB
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0x631F11A0

0x924EE0AB
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xBD4A1E25
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0xFD87C2DF
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0xFD7EA333
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0xCFEE7AF6
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0xD089CE11
ham."
0x4F2331AC

0x924EE0AB
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0x020A5566
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0x6C1F7AC5
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0xFC941F2F
harp."
0x82CC631B

0x924EE0AB
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0xB1783915
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xF8A0C1D4
night."
0x3B57BF70

0x924EE0AB
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0xEA9050A0
been?"
0x7162E22E

0x924EE0AB
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0xE39E3698
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0xF6EBF7B5
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x79AF5340

0x924EE0AB
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x94692EC4
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x6CC62666
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xDCC6CC0C
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0x92C68A43

0x924EE0AB
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x82BEF16F
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x8FB325A5
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x93FF88EC
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0xEED89D76
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x181CDD23
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x55D10E99
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x9A25849A
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x302E41D3
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x9A6D61C8
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x7B955812
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0xB5AA5F70

0x924EE0AB
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x551ED977
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0xB4F69784
soon."
0x523B67DB

0x924EE0AB
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x065EE65B

0x924EE0AB
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x5ADAD152
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xF479AF91
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x09171785
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x4801198B
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x6D55AE42
can feel is in her presence."
0x92546FC0

0x924EE0AB
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0xC4D87AB6
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0xB1F789D6
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x55A1846E
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x8CD33D2E

0x924EE0AB
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x3DA0A49C
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0xECBAC1B1
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x74651B77
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x543A565D
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0xFAD8C16A
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xCC3CC887
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x63A12A08
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x66535A45

0x924EE0AB
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x07EB592B
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x63FE2C92
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0xAF5E2A4A
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x189BCA95
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x9812A968
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x5652AFB9
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0x501E4ABA
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xAC765B99

0x924EE0AB
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x836BAE20
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0xB402CDE3
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x38D6A7EC
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x971E418A
deeper than I wished.
0xABC43490

0x924EE0AB
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0xA51F3C85
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x071A564E
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x32FB7CEC
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0xC012188E
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x3C32936A
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0xA9AFFDB2
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x0B832FE7
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x88FF6260

0x924EE0AB
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0x811F279F
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0xCA130AA4
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0xA1D61B1E
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x25E21F23
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0x7AE13CFC
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0xF5C2014C
up.
0xE50E124D

0x924EE0AB
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0xDAFCA3DD

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0xBCE5C60F

0x924EE0AB
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0xC2B211F8

0x924EE0AB
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x2F7842D2
Or what does it mean?"
0x88678EAF

0x924EE0AB
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0x16A4DE98

0x924EE0AB
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x15066A48
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x176E8312
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0xA1BB94A5

0x924EE0AB
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0x067797F3
perform."
0xDCD7D0E3

0x924EE0AB
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x8EE5FB11
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0x11F69229

0x924EE0AB
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0x4C6EE218
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0xF4AE1139

0x924EE0AB
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x4CBDDD10

0x924EE0AB
"Truly able."
0x4AB43DD7

0x924EE0AB
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0xF5415E7F

0x924EE0AB
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x70C2EC44

0x924EE0AB
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0xEF0804E1
parsonic?"
0xAFBA9C31

0x924EE0AB
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0x7A6E9260
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x56CE4265

0x924EE0AB
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x6BF73F0E
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x85606E23
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x8FB313E4

0x924EE0AB
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0xE881617B
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0xD5C8292C

0x924EE0AB
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0x355B86DF

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0x7CCEF824

0x924EE0AB
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x1B77259D
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x17AB6C2E
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x1EEEBCC4
immediately charm the snake.
0xB42B8E68

0x924EE0AB
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x78CE1D70
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0x1C8257EB

0x924EE0AB
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0x08F14ED6

0x924EE0AB
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xD310137C
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x3AF6CC62
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x963542EB
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0xC97994AD
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0xC47B9EB4
bargain."
0xFAB36346

0x924EE0AB
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0x77088DF4
sir."
0x130FB126

0x924EE0AB
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0x80F8AC8A
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0x7B2D6589
question or two."  He paused.
0xA5A95F3E

0x924EE0AB
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0x7461344D

0x924EE0AB
Then followed this cross-examination.
0x02B779F9

0x924EE0AB
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x71588066
cousin?"
0x58B29C7A

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0x77FCE29C

0x924EE0AB
"Daily."
0x5E009B03

0x924EE0AB
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0x51A88E3C
you are a talented creature!"
0x6A7F60FD

0x924EE0AB
"He approved of them--yes."
0xD0A442B4

0x924EE0AB
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0x76FCBA0B
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0x84F19C3D

0x924EE0AB
"I don't know about that."
0xA162C7F9

0x924EE0AB
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0x3278DCAD
there to see you?"
0xBF7547A3

0x924EE0AB
"Now and then?"
0x99922457

0x924EE0AB
"Of an evening?"
0xF3C3B234

0x924EE0AB
"Once or twice."
0x70CB020C

0x924EE0AB
A pause.
0x9BBC82F6

0x924EE0AB
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x3AE8B808
was discovered?"
0xCA8F1DCA

0x924EE0AB
"Five months."
0x7D9E727F

0x924EE0AB
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0x05BEEC81

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0x455B8CAD
window, and we by the table."
0x129F382D

0x924EE0AB
"Did he study much?"
0xFA09802F

0x924EE0AB
"A good deal."
0x8C0895D8

0x924EE0AB
"What?"
0xF668A3E1

0x924EE0AB
"Hindostanee."
0x992A720B

0x924EE0AB
"And what did you do meantime?"
0x72E80377

0x924EE0AB
"I learnt German, at first."
0xEE4406C4

0x924EE0AB
"Did he teach you?"
0xF1103698

0x924EE0AB
"He did not understand German."
0x72F8B5A4

0x924EE0AB
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0x5358794C

0x924EE0AB
"A little Hindostanee."
0x869048E5

0x924EE0AB
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0x7C80A447

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"And his sisters also?"
0xA418CBBE

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"Only you?"
0xB16A9CF8

0x924EE0AB
"Only me."
0x3690456C

0x924EE0AB
"Did you ask to learn?"
0x42342613

0x924EE0AB
"No."
0xBE3BC8D0

0x924EE0AB
"He wished to teach you?"
0x659912B3

0x924EE0AB
"Yes."
0x112D69E3

0x924EE0AB
A second pause.
0x94A27D9D

0x924EE0AB
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0x1CFB4BF0

0x924EE0AB
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xCF9D2AA3

0x924EE0AB
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0xF6458E88

0x924EE0AB
"He asked me to marry him."
0xCCE1C1DA

0x924EE0AB
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0xCEF560EB

0x924EE0AB
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0x66C6AEB2
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0x7E58426B

0x924EE0AB
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0x623A6E54
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0xB09F1C72
have given you notice to quit?"
0x1A593A05

0x924EE0AB
"Because I am comfortable there."
0x1A4506D3

0x924EE0AB
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0x295F5A00
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0x6C810173
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0x0234ACFF
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x5E0C3C5B
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x758BA5AC
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0x691B6F4C
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0xA201BD5C

0x924EE0AB
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0x8B7E45D4
accord."
0x93EC9DFF

0x924EE0AB
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0x267840F8
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0xC855B948
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0x92BFE924

0x924EE0AB
"Where must I go, sir?"
0xDAB62629

0x924EE0AB
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0xC6C0E56B

0x924EE0AB
"Who is that?"
0x9B30F8A7

0x924EE0AB
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0x47CBF650

0x924EE0AB
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x073D9288
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0xC596027D
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0xE4A3B8C1
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xD0033522
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0xB267BA24
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x94A90CFC
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x1CB10C1F
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x633A3B0F
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xFCE25EDD

0x924EE0AB
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x507F70A8
beloved master.  He smiled.
0x6F9ECC98

0x924EE0AB
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0x3DB1520E
you and Rivers?"
0x5D1540E1

0x924EE0AB
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0xA29BFD16
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0x5CE74B6B
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0xE63781BE
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0xAD941194
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xDD0EDBD9
of me from your presence for ever."
0x1BEEA4AE

0x924EE0AB
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0xDC5B4C0A

0x924EE0AB
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0xBCC8E889

0x924EE0AB
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0xDAC82DEA
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0xDBA01D6A
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x6BBE6B5A
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0x8A8FB6E7

0x924EE0AB
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0x2DA34892
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xF3FB5242
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0xBAD59B09

0x924EE0AB
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0xF3BF6B94
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xC17B02A8
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x221AC1B4
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x62B6B4C6
offers them so safe a prop."
0x15123F43

0x924EE0AB
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0xABDFA6B4

0x924EE0AB
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0x59699740

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0xDDBF607A
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x6857FE06
helped me.
0xE36BD734

0x924EE0AB
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0x70E99F46

0x924EE0AB
"Do you, sir?"
0x8E88D0F9

0x924EE0AB
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0x1191EEED

0x924EE0AB
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0x7A3142BB

0x924EE0AB
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0x0E83355F

0x924EE0AB
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0xED41A500

0x924EE0AB
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0x9D20959D

0x924EE0AB
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0x41E0423F

0x924EE0AB
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x0F1270E5

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0x5A181C68

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0x7A04836A
on?"
0x04AD6E42

0x924EE0AB
"Yes, sir."
0xF0E1BC3C

0x924EE0AB
"Truly, Jane?"
0x4AF67ED5

0x924EE0AB
"Most truly, sir."
0x145D28CC

0x924EE0AB
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0x84D51139

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0xA4144D14
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0x0F816AB5
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0x774578FA
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0x159F598F

0x924EE0AB
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x3ECE1178

0x924EE0AB
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0xFBB1F6A6
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x54DB68EB
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0x87F88BA3
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0xD42095C3

0x924EE0AB
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0x1569753F

0x924EE0AB
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0x94FBF7E5
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x4382F9F0
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0x121320A2

0x924EE0AB
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0xC3AE97D7
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0xCFCA28C0
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0x873BC99A
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x0743E82B
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0x7B7324A9
her?"
0xC6297B71

0x924EE0AB
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x59511464

0x924EE0AB
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0x32D98436
married instantly."
0xFE46B592

0x924EE0AB
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x91C0F8D7

0x924EE0AB
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0x13DF87EF
licence to get--then we marry."
0x125D9194

0x924EE0AB
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0xD0ED3C04
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0xE1F672ED
your watch."
0x85F90C0F

0x924EE0AB
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0xF58ABBCE
use for it."
0xFA29CCA9

0x924EE0AB
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x1DFF58AC
hungry?"
0x53C3C0B3

0x924EE0AB
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0x4E804310
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0x31FC4547

0x924EE0AB
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0x1D130603
is quite hot."
0x5A07CEA4

0x924EE0AB
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0x5A1D6685
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0x5EA6524E
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0x15AD469C

0x924EE0AB
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0x9F6183D6

0x924EE0AB
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0xB0B4DD74

0x924EE0AB
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x8FAB4812
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0xD22E0C0D
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0xDF09B528
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xB1EC0315
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x48A43EE7
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xE2DEA5F6
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0x096B180B
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0x6D49EEE9
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0xA2E08D6B
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0x66F44196
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0xD0360867
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0xE6C133F2
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0xE0951B21
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0x2E98BE10
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0x5DDB0182

0x924EE0AB
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0x9C511273
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x44C1D246
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0x7B631EF2
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0x1F6AC68E
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x6AD36B1B
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0x43CFA848
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0xBB736C44
rejoining Jane.
0x0D88C2AD

0x924EE0AB
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0x75A098A3
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0x37C1E530
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x5252B6E7
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x1ECF82AB
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x46DFAC85
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x345B93BD
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0xD3F0FE1E
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0xB5F67D3D
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0xC0243E4B
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x79638B6C

0x924EE0AB
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0xA54DEA41

0x924EE0AB
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0x43D5A6F0
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0x4157ADC3

0x924EE0AB
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0x1094625E

0x924EE0AB
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x10917069
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0x8C268E7C
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0xB19B0B26
that I heard what I now relate.
0x0826BD33

0x924EE0AB
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0x8F817F43
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0xAD7CBEBE
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x87C43114
are you?'
0x0E51D08A

0x924EE0AB
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x5FA71C30
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xD01DE711
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0x42113EA8
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0x1BC01F26
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x051F12EE
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0xCCA1DF07
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0x132336E8
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0xA8608BD1
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x09974419
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0x23F62A51

0x924EE0AB
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xE83955A6
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xF583B8A8
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xCB048A02
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0xFAF70B2A
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xF9DBCB2E
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xEC97FE8B
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0xD1F94036
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x300D8B2B
them in my heart.
0xE8646E56

0x924EE0AB
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xAB456B2F
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0x1540D463
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x7B8B5AFB
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x5CAEF861
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0xF1731E3F
God!"
0xEB17E43F

0x924EE0AB
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0xFF021868
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x88C06426
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x0427ED43

0x924EE0AB
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0x3E688F42
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0xF5C04250
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0xBC7B34DD

0x924EE0AB
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x3C8B3309
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x3F9691FF
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x53F31E10
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
0xB909E0A3

0x924EE0AB
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0xF450DADB

0x924EE0AB

0x924EE0AB
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0xD401AE58
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x9037130C
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x1621BE04
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0x93792A8A

0x924EE0AB
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0x5F63C46F
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0xBE3E2BBB
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0xBF2690BB
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x7D83F72E
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x0F7B7C6B
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0xF04BA495
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0xB1FE0282
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xC169B7DE
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x9A964991
again over the roast, said only--
0xF2FAF37F

0x924EE0AB
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0x6590DFFC

0x924EE0AB
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x39C4382C
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x4B6EA4E8
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xDDFAC33E

0x924EE0AB
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x93E87C35
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x1173DB40
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x0E4FA0F6
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0xA37E99E6
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x77140EE4
politely pulled his forelock.
0xAFFDB471

0x924EE0AB
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x4380934B
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x7816D00A
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xBA706836
caught the words--
0x6CAFCE48

0x924EE0AB
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x77E41489
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x19072149
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0xA7B5A057

0x924EE0AB
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xDBB9F583
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0xD7204DBC
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x3EC96D1A
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0x85949295

0x924EE0AB
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0xE05E0BA5
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x9311EBBA
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x2397A5B6
grave or mine."
0xEE777B00

0x924EE0AB
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x64C6DDC6
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0xDCE8F69E
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0xF3CF0570
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xCAD81F5A
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0xB60D0B5F
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x0B324CC6
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0xB85696C2

0x924EE0AB
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x0CE74F3C
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0xF851DBCD
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xB16F88CC
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0xF11E38F7
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0xD7C4B043
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x637DA983
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0xE8C73669
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x31F78728
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0xA41913DE
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x598B5EB8
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x7531A496
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0xD8C54BBE
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0x85FFD18F
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x47288C53
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0xE89ECC3A
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x908E372B
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x6D5D45DA
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0xFF046D5B

0x924EE0AB
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x9C70EAA2
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xECAEBB9E
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0xBAFC39AD

0x924EE0AB
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x8A54B2A8
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x4E2DEBA4
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0xD13E8CC2
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xFA3BA8EC
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x7E7B68E2
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x0A367199
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xF380DBAB
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xA5DB2874
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0xB15F11CC
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x66C6F7E5
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x89FB2AE3
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x7A6CEBEE
concord is the result.
0xB267E98D

0x924EE0AB
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x1E54DC55
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0xD2A5DA59
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0xEFAB92BC
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0xA9634FDF
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x35CE8C7F
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0xC06873C7
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x9094589D
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0xB59DD183
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xDF1F983F
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x3007B1B2
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0x3755B1A9
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x53462494
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x87F08151
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x7D6D9823
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0xD2AF6A49

0x924EE0AB
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x45122B14
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0x10588D70
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x225EE30D

0x924EE0AB
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x0BFCE9C0

0x924EE0AB
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0xAB3119F4

0x924EE0AB
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0xE81C7EC6

0x924EE0AB
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xBD78F261
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0x8948575C
sure of it.
0x05F1AF0C

0x924EE0AB
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x14631637
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x2FF24A80
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x91A91709
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x9E255C16
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xC4ECC87B
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xF830F1F4
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x135EEB6F
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0xB7C00152

0x924EE0AB
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0xB1EF2BA3
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0xBEBA7C85
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x0190DAAB
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x1D967D1D
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x9E362232
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x292DF112
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x3D604857

0x924EE0AB
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0xA27BA991
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x88AEE4AF
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x2265589B
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x05322852
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x09B4A080
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x6F76B9FA
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x9D225CA3
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x47BB9177
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x498DF3D2
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0x9BAE0D10
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x02B0EFAC
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x168FF9DD
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0xE8AB963F
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0x2DD60A9C
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x466AFB14

0x924EE0AB
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x5C006745
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x62947578
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x35D368EE
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x13DED773
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xCEF32409
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0x1F746CF7
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x249D512B
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x8177BBF3
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0xF0C565FC
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0xFD1E3991

0x924EE0AB
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x8EEA7C4E
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0xA5EA4505
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
0xA97CED24
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
0xE0997181
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
0x5458BEF8
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
0xE4D17F78
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
0x657709B3
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
0xDE152035
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
0x5D89E566
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
0xD9225030
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
0xF21C7C13
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
0xFDF91D46

0x924EE0AB
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x730C1869
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x4E8821CC
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0x3E7E2945
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x33D4AD66
people in all walks of life.
0x46D64E32

0x924EE0AB
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0xC126335E
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0xAE57F3CC
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0x8A527784
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0x4D53D4E7
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0xFF40F710
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
0x9AE7008D
Literary Archive Foundation
0xE000CF87

0x924EE0AB
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0x250BB082
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0x96D25B5B
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0xFB1756B1
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0xE54B95CA
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0x6042BE75
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0xCCB28D61
status with the IRS.
0x1C75A6C4

0x924EE0AB
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0x008A3936
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0x79478679
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0xE2384545
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0x18197E8E
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0xCE1893B5
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
0x9CCC54E8
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
0x32868F7F
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
0xF59664D3

0x924EE0AB
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
0xDA0358A1
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0x8A6CC3DD
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0xF1ACF686
approach us with offers to donate.
0x3798C5D4

0x924EE0AB
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
0x9509B94B
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
0x22855B3E
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
0xFB354BDD
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0x223753BB
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
0xEAEC4A2A
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0x1050911A

0x924EE0AB
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
0x2DB68ACF
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0xBF47AF6C
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
0x6B98385F
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
