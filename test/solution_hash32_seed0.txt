PREFACE
0x34392B83

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x1D830909
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0xD8750AE8
miscellaneous remark.
0x18464A9E

0x0F7B6850
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x8E27A488

0x0F7B6850
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0xB1851D19
few pretensions.
0x6536C7F7

0x0F7B6850
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0xC763D722
obscure aspirant.
0x7835EE37

0x0F7B6850
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0xA2CABE6F
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x462752F4
Author.
0xA4F33BD9

0x0F7B6850
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x719DAD69
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x1DA5B54F
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xDB8EBA53
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x3750AF39
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0xF725B73B
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0x56F06141

0x0F7B6850
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0xA514615E
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0x2954CC14
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0xF3FD738D
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x314206C7
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0xD815D68A
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x82FA0ECE
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0xFCA50B6C
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0xFCBF6BC1

0x0F7B6850
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x00D5BC3E
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x66EAB59B
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0xA6FE0ACB
Thorns.
0x66F36B97

0x0F7B6850
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xB889C9D9
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x3E7FDD93
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x203212B4
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xA27610C7
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0x098D9E5C
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xFA0BA370
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x48643B73

0x0F7B6850
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x59167D7F
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x2CD2F8E6
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xFE3C29C8
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x847B7DB4
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x320522BD
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x581AF21E

0x0F7B6850
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x33946E88
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x689EE1F9
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xB3B423FF
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x354BFAFE

0x0F7B6850
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x130557D1
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x55EF0E31
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x4BE1FF87
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x60A04AAE
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x2C8700E3
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0xB9B12FC5
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x5222DFA6
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x9808BE98
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0xE796AA83
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xD9B06967

0x0F7B6850
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x3FFEE6B7
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0xE9350460
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xC8448209
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0x8D70E879
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x30A7BDA5
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0x13395BED
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0xCCE2FCB6
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0xDB224D80
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x0FF7E8AB
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x376F0B9A
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xC3B22F2E
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0x6C6B9698
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0xA78FDCF1
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0x6E6BD5F8
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0x97B62CA9

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x2C77D632
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x244B4BC3
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x07558E1A
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xD302925B
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0xC363D8D7
denied where it is justly due.
0x95B6EF26

0x0F7B6850
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0xAA68E917
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
0x5F2188C2

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0xE200330C
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0xBF58E5DC
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x609D03CB
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0x46BE69CE
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0x401AD8E2

0x0F7B6850
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xCCBBD948
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x783628BD
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xD9309AB0
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x4E43533B
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0xFDFE5EEA

0x0F7B6850
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x06C8F08D
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0x28509CFE
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x3D7A3D89
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x4AB375DF
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x1512C658
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xBA99798A
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x41FEA224
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0xD7D104B5
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x84A885B1
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0xEB6C87E6
little children."
0x6A670E1A

0x0F7B6850
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0xDC1F937C

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0x9D11D8F6
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0x0415592D
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0x235316A7

0x0F7B6850
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x4B813EA8
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xC1CCE992
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0xE5BC62BA
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x0768051E
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0x00B13CC5
retirement.
0x85840FCF

0x0F7B6850
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x1F65D7DA
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x12790C2D
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xA3FBD057
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0x2D0091F1
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x1694EB38
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0xA204443B
lamentable blast.
0x698DBD46

0x0F7B6850
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x2BB5FF8C
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0xFA3AAD89
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x512C3224
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0xF73387D9
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x869D2070
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x8AAC02E5
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0x7E9C6762

0x0F7B6850
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0xE70E4A66
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x868D83D9
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0x326F019F
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0xB24BD2F8

0x0F7B6850
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0xEBCC96B2
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x9A499493
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0xFD60A7F2
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x21B3D154
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x3108AB22
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x9AE39DEF
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0x37EAB972
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x38CA0B04
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0x1A14FD69
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0xEBF33862
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0xA75FAE8D
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x3BE9A63F
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x706A8ACD

0x0F7B6850
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0xF6242474
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x61F484F8
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x965BA6E6
hour of eventide.
0x5B46246B

0x0F7B6850
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0xB6966D3B

0x0F7B6850
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x550C2841
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0xFC3C7763

0x0F7B6850
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0xCF9EB0AF
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x43E0B39E

0x0F7B6850
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x6AA6E563
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x1AF24523
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0xF634F427
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x55EBEA47
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x7FEC6A88
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0xD2309DDE
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xAA945C43
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x858E356C
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x9A7C7881

0x0F7B6850
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x57C08A4E
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0xCCE9774E
room door opened.
0x95E4A79D

0x0F7B6850
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0xA57247C3
found the room apparently empty.
0xC9FF1907

0x0F7B6850
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x24EC241E
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x45130C95
animal!"
0x86A028A9

0x0F7B6850
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x9BD19FC6
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0xF1F96F32
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x774318E4
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x7271D13D

0x0F7B6850
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x7CBBB91D

0x0F7B6850
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0xAF685EF6
forth by the said Jack.
0xC1E28C0F

0x0F7B6850
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x6D66DBB2

0x0F7B6850
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0x3132E731
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x2DC6C12F
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xFD61ACF3

0x0F7B6850
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0xDF7AC90F
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x3E8BB443
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0xBE5B2DAC
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x7277B061
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x2230FD91
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x79395489
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0xB89A78FE
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x008A265D
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0xE696230E
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xAC049FB3
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x451266D3
home.
0x66E7391B

0x0F7B6850
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x384BAABF
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0x2C45CF57
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0xDE9F28C5
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0xC41B6877
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x3BB054C2
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0x3838187F
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xE75F576D
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x56FC8428
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0xB2A6707C
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0xEBBE681C
her back.
0x7A434C90

0x0F7B6850
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x28EDDC8D
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0x4E82E0CD
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0xAB508848
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x7FA3F774
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0xC5A1E668
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0xF32EFA3E
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x65ABFF7D
chair.
0xFA2408F1

0x0F7B6850
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x827D73C1
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x3E6F9026
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x2495F27F

0x0F7B6850
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x474A2DAA
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x20977D4B
insult.
0xDFBBF823

0x0F7B6850
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0xDBDDECB9

"I was reading."
0xC6CB03AB

0x0F7B6850
"Show the book."
0xFECADC8C

0x0F7B6850
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0xEDB8DB85

0x0F7B6850
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x5A42951B
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xD33BC2A6
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0x91AF12F1
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0x0F2439FC
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xB3A3D8D0
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0x82684CFA
the mirror and the windows."
0x7103290E

0x0F7B6850
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xCF6A9385
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x209DABFA
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0xDFCD4458
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x2169DFD8
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0xB70AB169
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x95E86F6F

0x0F7B6850
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x56B3753B
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0xABBEC048

0x0F7B6850
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x5BB9EA57
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0xE1961E97
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0x7E4C83A0

0x0F7B6850
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0xBC1FF3BA
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xAC5F23F9

0x0F7B6850
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0x2538B2BA
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x87C281CA
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0xB0D326AA
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0xB24C30CE
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x6AAB18B9
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0x9277BE75
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x54F8C30B
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0x1F4A415B
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x1BFB9EEC

0x0F7B6850
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0x10B928BD

0x0F7B6850
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x3F438A43

0x0F7B6850
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x9CD0D22A

0x0F7B6850
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x5090AAB2
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x5C8AD680

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER II
0x554EA5B0

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xDEE5E682
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x1FFC79C9
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x7AC9CC19
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0xDC4DC13E
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0xE644B428
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0xFD171971

0x0F7B6850
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x52EEDF15

0x0F7B6850
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x485B8F71
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x173F78AE
young master."
0x64CAE91E

0x0F7B6850
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0xF3FAF414

0x0F7B6850
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x60CF1882
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0xED2C7F88

0x0F7B6850
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0xD19303D8
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0x27733C82
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0xC7CBCAA7

0x0F7B6850
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x64F06A07
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0xC11CACF0

0x0F7B6850
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0xA0704E60
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x2F500375
little of the excitement out of me.
0x3F5669CF

0x0F7B6850
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x35C0C414

0x0F7B6850
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x92FD1B00

0x0F7B6850
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0xBE24D083
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0xF3CAEA89
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0x9EA39616
incredulous of my sanity.
0x247809D7

0x0F7B6850
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0xBE8CFB93

0x0F7B6850
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x7867EC71
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0xF053DA78
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0xC2E80849

0x0F7B6850
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0xAD90D3DA
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xC034627C
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0xC2CBCE1C

0x0F7B6850
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0x9B2DD2EC
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0x156AA00D
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0x608CBDE1
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x6C36A264

0x0F7B6850
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x3ACA0645
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x8EE164DC
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x8B474939
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x526C939E
them."
0x39FB7C45

0x0F7B6850
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0xCF7D6F41
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x79A70328
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x51011214
away, I am sure."
0x7EC4124C

0x0F7B6850
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x571A5FB7
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xF2A6D843
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x9D3E3335
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0xBA867E5D
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x35EFDBF6
fetch you away."
0x77488D8C

0x0F7B6850
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0x69F9C36F

0x0F7B6850
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0xF7319A93
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0x19A1B5D5
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x16BCCBA7
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x1944C616
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0x7784513B
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0xAB00C289
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x965EF483
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x74CF5451
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xCE0CEB15
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x9199218A
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0x14E674C2
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0xB4F63085
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x80B53C4B
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x47F40BC3
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x28E2B16B
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x9C34E83B

0x0F7B6850
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0xE3F0A1AF
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x9265DF09
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0x0A26E0C9
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x42B9A993
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x9236706F
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x73C643D6
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0xDA5A9A85
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0xA5B435E3
in spite of its grandeur.
0x6EA9557E

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x140D4F47
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0xA4820C88
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x061135B6
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0x627E2A26

0x0F7B6850
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x0758B987
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0x532670D4
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0x3A5DA317
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x64291174
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xA81B78E7
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xCFABBD29
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x0351DA9D
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x5DFF4368
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0x77F0778A
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x7B01B4C4
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0x731F72CE
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x326D9C4F
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0xDED0A04D
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0xF764B1F2
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0xDE7EC86A
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x4282B778

0x0F7B6850
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x25D217EB
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x70696854
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0x76F945CA
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x8157934F

0x0F7B6850
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xFAD398C7
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x37AB41CD
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0xCFDC9A42
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x2BC49109
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x788F0762
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0xBCFA61FC
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0xBEBD5E0F
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x27138468
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x813A06A9
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0xFC012FF9
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x9AEA2C0E
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0xB2A2348E
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x2371351E
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0x3435EB04
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x9DB9B361
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x6AD94449
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x9E917C13
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x8A523099
night.
0x4AC5A855

0x0F7B6850
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x3731C664
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x170BE3FE
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x85A62810
general opprobrium.
0x7661F7C7

0x0F7B6850
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x912B7A52
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0xE95303A9
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x2CB0D5DE
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x32F7E52D
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0x18A20EC1

0x0F7B6850
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0xF77042AF
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0x262196A1
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x1FD25046
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0xCE7EBCBB
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xC792513B

0x0F7B6850
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0x48D4A8C2
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0x793C5FF0
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xF123961C
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0xAB1AD19E
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x3C3BB2C8
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x37AAF2A4
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0xEE8A69F6
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x10254018
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x69375DC8
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x315DF39F
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x43FFB087
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0xA148C303
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xD2F03936

0x0F7B6850
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x47ADD1A8
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0xC1123869
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x012879F1
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x1C040BFA
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x03F61CD0
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0xBBA6D566
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x947F07BB
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0xE8EE45CE
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x42320F3E
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x63E3144D
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x699BBDB2
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xC8E965FC
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x4360CC25
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x178756E7
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0xCFD533B1
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0xE237B62C
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0x06D7D8A2
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0xE042AF07
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0xDDEC34BA
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xCD6F8811
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x44863CF0
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0xF25B996A

0x0F7B6850
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x421DDA69
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0x6ECB21BD
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0xE781305F
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x33668FBF
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0xBA9720A5
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0xD42B6907
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x657132A9
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x5CFA3A5D
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0xF91AE57D
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0x38B3DF40
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0xDDB91528
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0xE8D491BE
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0x8219D302
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x22AA410A
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x43CABAD1
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0xDDB2D736
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xF3C8C1F4
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x2BD1579C
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0xCC787E1D
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x5BE7F79F
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x1C519288
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0xF3C18229
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0xF556BF0B
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0xF6ECB59A
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x6633950A
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0xEC48B05F
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x259DF5AD
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x280977BA
Abbot entered.
0xC8727339

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x418F0F30

0x0F7B6850
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0xC8FC0DA6

0x0F7B6850
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xCEAD9A1F

0x0F7B6850
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xB335FDB9
Bessie.
0xBD10B495

0x0F7B6850
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x47A6AF87
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x38C2C512

0x0F7B6850
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x496C92EF
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0xE5F39410
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x09E4D56E

0x0F7B6850
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xE5CCEC20
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x6EACB5C1
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x25303061
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0xAA878F57

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0x0043EC3C

0x0F7B6850
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0xF6B790E7
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x3CD1D8D7
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x6D9B363C
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x755F1832
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x1E909ED2
then."
0x19FC1E46

0x0F7B6850
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xAD5CE758
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0xB71A223B

0x0F7B6850
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0x62D487B7
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0x04D859F6
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x614EACA7
duplicity.
0xD864F2A2

0x0F7B6850
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0xEA83CD62
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x1E3112B9
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x30F3C9C2
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER III
0x21FE385E

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0x77A3710C
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0xE6F5FD55
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0xC0C3CBC7
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0xBAB848BA
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x46EC0E98
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x6644F643
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x229EA8EA
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0xF0C09AEB
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0x8E916D68

0x0F7B6850
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0xD47020F8
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0xAC9D4BB1
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0xFE025273
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x8AD53A89
pillow, leaning over me.
0x1713BBAB

0x0F7B6850
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0x00405E03
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x3ABA82C4
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x941F6E1E
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x1B1FAF22
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0xDBA119E7
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x12D9C88F
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x875BCC1A
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x2664040D

0x0F7B6850
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0x80480688

0x0F7B6850
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0x366608C9
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x558ACC88
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xF45D0BEC
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x670A57D4
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0xF0FAAB31
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x14FD51EE
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0xB65AEA00
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0xD8C87927

0x0F7B6850
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x297FF324

0x0F7B6850
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x5BD07F8F
rough.  "I will try."
0xB751189F

0x0F7B6850
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0xCC8EF069

0x0F7B6850
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xBDE3DB16

0x0F7B6850
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0x2BBE269C
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x3DC3C733

0x0F7B6850
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0xADE4A225

0x0F7B6850
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0xEE789E50

0x0F7B6850
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x2C4A489A
soon, no doubt."
0x723C1325

0x0F7B6850
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0xDB1FD10B
say--
0xCA378D44

0x0F7B6850
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0x32623E8D
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x31ECEEEA
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x03977A3D
rather too hard."
0xB37A34E3

0x0F7B6850
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x0EE27CD1
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x03039E1B
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0x6C354E59
the main subject discussed.
0xCF2BE110

0x0F7B6850
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0xE1092B5D
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0xB641A142
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x6B1E232E

0x0F7B6850
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0x6B3BDFC9
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x9C178708
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0xA9E18971

0x0F7B6850
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xDFFCB5E8
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x7F34F4AC
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0x3BFF1774
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0xDC7CDC29
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x725F8A5D
bad propensities.
0xD30DC5D5

0x0F7B6850
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x21927D87
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0xBBA61052
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0x30083E53
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x57FDCB5F
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x0E751AE6
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0xF69210B4
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0xE4EB23EA
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xF4679D1C
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x551C421B
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xBCD5454A
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xAB8BB1E9
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x6C4C4B81
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xAEFC2000

0x0F7B6850
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0x53FE7815
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x2C07C38E
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x05EDD65B
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x4AF67AF2
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0xBD9D97AC
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x1112259B
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0xBA908151
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x1A2AE0BC
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xAE59136C
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xB2FFAF37
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x4885E5AE
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0xDFDE6C8D
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0xBE6C2030
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x91C4CADC
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x390CB446
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x8AEA7B6D
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0xA4F53218
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x3E7E8CD7
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x9954105A
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x252A24BF
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0xDBAA8C76
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xEE16384D
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x0A6C5E77
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0xBA8357D6
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x24D9605C
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0xEDCF60E4
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xC0DFAD06
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x9A6A5F33
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0x944D9166
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x9DE5D149
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xDC477A97
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x172CAA79
untasted tart.
0xA7FDF6BD

0x0F7B6850
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0xCD008CB5
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xDAE20163
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0xB342B9D9
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x6078FEEB

0x0F7B6850
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x73BC9B70
      A long time ago."
0x06E1E6F6

0x0F7B6850
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x0496DF10
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0xAD6FDD7A
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x37E3C0D6
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x8C36F206
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0xADC668C2
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0xC1C724FA
one.
0x4B321657

0x0F7B6850
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x49EE04A0
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x06497050
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x9F444B6D
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0xA0B16E14

0x0F7B6850
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0xEC179512
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0x20E6A139
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0x2EEA2E28
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x471BC0A4

0x0F7B6850
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x06036C52
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0xD3EB4D78
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0x358BA710
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0x171D9BA5

0x0F7B6850
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x66D3C1FF
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x15D89A03
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x87AD365A
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0x21CB9744

0x0F7B6850
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x26FAB4F4
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x97B645EF
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0x6412AEE1
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0xF06833AA

0x0F7B6850
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0xB97FE36C
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x26B09123
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x2AC94A1C
Lloyd came again.
0x3E15A042

0x0F7B6850
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0x798F1354
how is she?"
0xA1DF6FC9

0x0F7B6850
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0x01912337

0x0F7B6850
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x0ED1C3BB
is Jane, is it not?"
0xFAAEA1CF

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0x1E2A0D77

0x0F7B6850
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x4A3CBB6B
Have you any pain?"
0x3F27BE00

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0x0F7B6850
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x5A7955B9
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0x7F9A1AD1

0x0F7B6850
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x2B0333B0

0x0F7B6850
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x5943E1E5
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0xFAB48ED0
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xA075A42A

0x0F7B6850
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x6282B654

0x0F7B6850
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x78E14435
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x8BFCB84D
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x2671C7CE
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xEAABF0CD
leisure, he said--
0x08A18DEC

0x0F7B6850
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0xDB681A92

0x0F7B6850
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x37F08AE8

0x0F7B6850
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0xCA93D3E5
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x1754E4FC

0x0F7B6850
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0x0EDE74F2
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x6124D73A
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xD7C28386

0x0F7B6850
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x4C8A5090
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0xEBC309BD
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x153FA3F1

0x0F7B6850
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0xAF0809B4
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x1B4F7B1A

0x0F7B6850
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0xF7FD19AB
Bessie was gone.
0x19F11A66

0x0F7B6850
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0xE18731AC

0x0F7B6850
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0xF1C391C5

0x0F7B6850
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0xF19E202D

0x0F7B6850
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x43567203
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x8F9858B9
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0xED86E81F
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x49198342

0x0F7B6850
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0x482B14BA
daylight?"
0x00BEFCA8

0x0F7B6850
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x677DC7C3
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0x976D5E6D

0x0F7B6850
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0x3DD1F8DA

0x0F7B6850
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0x0CAEC04B
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x598AD09C
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xDE7F2FF2
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0x57215B80
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x1ABDE45A
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0x114308CA
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x222C3C58

0x0F7B6850
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0xF4ED3A02

0x0F7B6850
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0xEB80AF35

0x0F7B6850
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0xDF15BE45

0x0F7B6850
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x1D63830A

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xB38743BC

0x0F7B6850
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xF2DF6CD7
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0xAF9A8A3E

0x0F7B6850
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x1942DB3C
than a servant."
0x467C7537

0x0F7B6850
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0x69CF7A60

0x0F7B6850
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x65C3D44F
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0x0095AB76

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0xD46F3B85

0x0F7B6850
"I think not, sir."
0xF35BCD5B

0x0F7B6850
"None belonging to your father?"
0xA75E5EB3

0x0F7B6850
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xF9C70533
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x136072BA
them."
0x39FB7C45

0x0F7B6850
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x7B60878A

0x0F7B6850
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x8C840FA4
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xDB8A06B7
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0xBAC78733
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x5ABBE20A
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0xA7B054BF

0x0F7B6850
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0xA7E30480

0x0F7B6850
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0xF8639A1D

0x0F7B6850
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0xFD9D80F4
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x355EFD63
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x583FFCCF
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0xF119BB77
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0xA5EFD6D8
the price of caste.
0x4CF656B2

0x0F7B6850
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x4A8EDDE3

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0x39FBA1CF
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x7A0F9FA2

0x0F7B6850
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x29618A49

0x0F7B6850
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0xF57EDB75
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xA0DB889A
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x9937C49A
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x988F3947
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x0EB50339
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0x4D405BEB
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xFFB7D052
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0x8143A3CA
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0x1C75FE4C
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x7135FEE6
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0xAFA6956E
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0xE95FCADE
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0xD11655F2
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0x1EBA37D5

0x0F7B6850
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x2D34F0EA
musings.
0x37681E2D

0x0F7B6850
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0x90BC8DD1
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0xBE7690FD
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0xEC8735EC

0x0F7B6850
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0xD65BDDD4
the gravel-walk.
0xA7EAA0AA

0x0F7B6850
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0x4002E48E
to her before I go."
0x9553E8ED

0x0F7B6850
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x77D8D0E1
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0x3A1343D5
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0xCDE33C4C
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0x8AC41859
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0x2408A802
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0xA3A33195
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x8B78BB47
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x1331FB46
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x0938EC00
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x953B0D22

0x0F7B6850
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0x8EDF4B7D
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xDECAFB42
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x9CC8102F
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x0073F50B
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0xD3B94822
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0xB1B09E52
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x18842B75
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0xED3DF7C7
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0x90F1E686
of each other.
0x942DC4FB

0x0F7B6850
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x9B88B74F
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0xE68FD287

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x85E923AC
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x26DA187F
little toad as that."
0x5B28AC18

0x0F7B6850
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0xE6F63FDE
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x223F0E67

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0x59880ECE
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x3811EC26
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0xFDD2C236
rabbit for supper."
0x34E4B4CB

0x0F7B6850
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
0x1FF17FB8

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER IV
0x8B53D704

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0xFEF62909
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x6BD07F37
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xCEEA2E21
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x024B3D92
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x3973150A
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0x8C7D03DD
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x9B1ED6C7
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0xF73CC482
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x650C8719
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0xF1E6C00A
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x3DDF44BC
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x8F25B554
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x76068700
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x8328BCE0
and rooted aversion.
0xBE3EFA5F

0x0F7B6850
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0x7991CB4D
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xD2721693
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0xF7806B75
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x22A3D885
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x23460A9B
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0xDAB60551
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xB766ADF5
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0xFC2E70B5
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xABB8FFD1
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x69B95216
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0x8700458C
was stopped rather harshly--
0x8E748849

0x0F7B6850
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x0A9AE88A
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x9E13B129
should associate with her."
0x5D913F84

0x0F7B6850
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0xB1EF2631
deliberating on my words--
0x770656AD

0x0F7B6850
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x81C00169

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0xACF3EA04
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x99BEC0C8
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x77AD4DDA
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0x08BE3666
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x6ED171AB

0x0F7B6850
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0xC2390949
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x3486CB1A
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0x638BA0F7
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x8D4F4231

0x0F7B6850
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xCE2F36CD
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0xB7D9A05E
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0xD4D074E5
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x7B63957A

0x0F7B6850
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x1BBDABCB
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0xB6E6BEAF
wish me dead."
0xF0AB671D

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0xC3A4E45E
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xB884C780
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0xA78BEE05
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0xBEEEDC33
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x0301E552
in my breast.
0xC1F340B0

0x0F7B6850
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x86DA53B2
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x0AC4A0DE
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0xD4E029B2
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0x65F61490
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xB65B2561
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xAB5A1375
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x2A8CB185
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0xC55ED9FB
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x35D98887
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xF96B7AAD
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x31459FD1
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0xCD601FD9
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0xD21B4B67
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x2FA65CB0
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x37332D82
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xF61F7CA5
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0xDA1652C6
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x28253816
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0xA164E838
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x292E74F3
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0xA2AB3667
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x66E01BAC
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x9B46495C
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x6F8054AD
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x6957F844
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x889678A0
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0xBB0AFE38
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xEA82B76B
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x59656DE7
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x13B09842
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xDEE353F6
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x7CCA5342
to be happy likewise.
0x490AE872

0x0F7B6850
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x400800D8
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x54076039
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0xD60FDE88
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x713C72EB
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x24A37671
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0xD636A5FB
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x995220A0
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x299F3912
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x3FA7F8CB
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xA8B31DFC
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x3015A076
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xAD372A0D
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0xB76EE0A8
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xC8C3A4A9
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x44357273
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x5179DDE4
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x2B796E01
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0xC2555D13
Gateshead Hall.
0x895CE259

0x0F7B6850
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xB4C45DBE
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0x36094204
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0x594263BA
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x0FA77A1A
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0xE686C08A
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0xB71C565F
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x36703B2F
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x0D075524
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xABDD0F6B
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0xB5D0ED4A
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0xC2602061
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0xF7C5E8CD
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0x9E78CDFE
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x9738A8CA
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xA51A34B3
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0xCD5CCB84
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x8483C341
accuracy.
0x22C8D26C

0x0F7B6850
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x3360A031
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x4B5CD33E
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0xF930786E
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0xE49E9F1C
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x436CEBC5
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0xCD24671E
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x28737536
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xDC8408FC
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x35A77740
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0xAD8A387B
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0xA6F5F03C
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x08EC0076
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x4A04CC2B
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xD894D05B
frost.
0xA7F23E2B

0x0F7B6850
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0x5A81048A
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0xF4B125B3
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xAB30A1C8
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xE2098DF4
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0xA8A7CFFE
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x6758247C
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0x823FE0B1
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x645FDA60
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x925FE047
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0xF15FE901
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x78EA52C0
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0xB33E8A47
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0x577F6B2B
nursery.
0xB50CA292

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x9CB7C9B8
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0xFCD4073E
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0xA6299AE9
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0xD8CDC9CB
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x5800C56E

0x0F7B6850
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0xEC8928DE

0x0F7B6850
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x845D78BA
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x03C04BF9
window for?"
0xE5810356

0x0F7B6850
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0xB1A1E248
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xAB89DB2C
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x6DAB0561
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0xB4620961
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0xB5B7D3EB
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0xD9DFAA62

0x0F7B6850
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x154D7BA4
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0xB3CB3BEA
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x2C6EB8E6
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0xB48CF270
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0xF10FA17B
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x8FD2DF42

0x0F7B6850
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xFAE9B661
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0xBEAE3B90
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x4AD10E5C
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x961B2FD0
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x001A8B35
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0xFADD3408

0x0F7B6850
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x67A5EE85
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x2EDD77CA
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x12CAD6D7
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0xC5BE6CDF
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x29B879E4
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0xB2A8CB4C
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x2317B6A7
by way of capital.
0x008D15E9

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x70525471
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x10B298C5
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x5AB63F63
you."
0x889FF9EF

0x0F7B6850
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x223BA688
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x1AA3DF32
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x5F25828B
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0xC4D2E2C4

0x0F7B6850
"Ten years."
0x78771246

0x0F7B6850
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x15B6D6F4
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x78F5CF5C

0x0F7B6850
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x681852D6

0x0F7B6850
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x2EB8959D
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0x728A3052
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0x0E34ED37

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x5B9C112A

0x0F7B6850
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0xD7B142AF
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0xBDFC8921
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0xF35370F9
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x85FBA731

0x0F7B6850
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x5954C06F
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0xBEB6B448
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x749A1CEC

0x0F7B6850
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x0C126C9D
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x631E8C6A
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0xF2F46B82

0x0F7B6850
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x9C62B2C1
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0xA9CAF490

0x0F7B6850
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x80A5EAB4

0x0F7B6850
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x9F10C6EB

0x0F7B6850
"A pit full of fire."
0x1E936ECC

0x0F7B6850
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x5F20E887
ever?"
0xEA2C794C

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0x0F7B6850
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x0A309090

0x0F7B6850
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0xCEA89A31
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xDE2E7542

0x0F7B6850
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xCB04C307
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0xF0D47E83
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0xD05B366D
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0xDDA04EAE

0x0F7B6850
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x674CE2CC
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0x2513FC4F
enough away.
0x15C5D5D7

0x0F7B6850
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0xAC710924
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x23728F2E

0x0F7B6850
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0x1C31478B
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x95CF5ED0

0x0F7B6850
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x6AE75C0B

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x251C00D0

0x0F7B6850
"Sometimes."
0x8A7935D4

0x0F7B6850
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x8377FA3B

0x0F7B6850
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0x1507132F
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0xDBEC049B
and Jonah."
0x16128325

0x0F7B6850
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0xDA0F2223

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0x0F7B6850
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x353723BB
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x06EFB87E
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x8C5E187B
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x50D7793B
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x00064E34
piety."
0x2DDEA1D3

0x0F7B6850
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x0A2702CE

0x0F7B6850
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x61C8287E
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x17FA0C4F
give you a heart of flesh."
0xF507563A

0x0F7B6850
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x67CB944B
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x88698417
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0xCA610E29
conversation herself.
0x72DC8BDF

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x5FC927ED
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0x37D4D8D3
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x4A0A5396
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0x087CABB4
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0xE093C2EE
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0x81BE068D
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xB56093AD

0x0F7B6850
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x97521144
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x0C51ED1C
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0xC8018B3E
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0x123C1C8A
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0x39F74CB9
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x1C1F5318
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x7FFDC4D2
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x545706C8
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0xA8725DAB
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0xB5317892

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x098F9A44
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x76DAF31C

0x0F7B6850
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0x96BE750F
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0x6E4B418C
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0xB80A1015
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0xD4BDB380

0x0F7B6850
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xFAE43AAD
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0xE240F9DB
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0xA2D72A0E
Lowood."
0x56B82620

0x0F7B6850
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x01C29E20
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0xB69BE41F
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x709EA359
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x68B6AEF5
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xA23C5D78
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xB5FE6911
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x8174CB2C
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x7EB3C1EB
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x98AE8C12
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x0A5C05E0
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x0D561D5F
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0xE69DEE45

0x0F7B6850
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x4C84BED4
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0x37C6B251
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0xD78E971A
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x0A4AF709

0x0F7B6850
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0xAC7D79AF
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xB7C10DB2
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0xEA1BCD3E
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xA55C4FF6
inhabitants."
0x778016B9

0x0F7B6850
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0xF78560F1
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0x82513E7C
and prospects?"
0x8D19FCEC

0x0F7B6850
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x9B1D99DE
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0xD6272562
of her election."
0xD0088DA5

0x0F7B6850
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x730C395C
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x3DC5C233
becoming too irksome."
0xA94DA94C

0x0F7B6850
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0x9AAF97E2
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0x5AA993AA
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0xF505CD80
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0xB9F21282
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x5924BD6B

0x0F7B6850
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x6FC011C2
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x8F2051FC

0x0F7B6850
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0x00431E05
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x973BE6E4
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x6A56894C
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x6F601D33

0x0F7B6850
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0xA727F9C6
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xA936D2E4

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x1B79D914
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x061344BA
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x5947FB98
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0xD652A7ED
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x29D47135
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0xA308F8F2
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x88A9A920
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x362C9E7F
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0xEC84A3A1
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x290409F6
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0xFE3CB7C4
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x069C78D0
handsome attire.
0xA518D02E

0x0F7B6850
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0xD4DE7C1E
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x62B11963
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x12C8A57A
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x56243077
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x946AB2ED
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x8B554A18
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0xF0AFD464
fomented now within me.
0x2E34B4B7

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0xC1DF4FFB
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x88DE6208

0x0F7B6850
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x94326A13
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0xA1B873E2
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x99315DE2
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xF001B96C
to her.
0xA1376DFD

0x0F7B6850
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0xA2A23BFE
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x3C49DC46
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0xF6887EB5

0x0F7B6850
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x218D1252
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x507E3936
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x4C59371B
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x648475BD

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x9537C334
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0xDC314D9B

0x0F7B6850
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xD16D2C43
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x88E5F952
used to a child.
0x99F2E60F

0x0F7B6850
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x699EDF6D
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x63554C55

0x0F7B6850
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0xBF5986E2
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x956D91E2
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x0963C28E
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x59FCCA06
miserable cruelty."
0xB2FED853

0x0F7B6850
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0xF265C71B

0x0F7B6850
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0xCCF3FE3D
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x67DB7F51
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x36A26F60
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xEE807715
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x64702D3E
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0xA8B466F4
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0xD4E122B8
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0x2DA75D61
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0xB22D3452
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x8030B253

0x0F7B6850
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0x96FC18AA

0x0F7B6850
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xB5229841
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x6F35F18C
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x1B8018AB
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x7009B658
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x17EA8551
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x3EB2A64B
would cry.
0x69EF39C9

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x0C13C4F6
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x16FEB48B

0x0F7B6850
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x298500CE

0x0F7B6850
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x847E3865
your friend."
0x365A4187

0x0F7B6850
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0x045DC5C9
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xC072D812
you have done."
0xBBA08BA0

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x8F9A62C2
their faults."
0x277C0040

0x0F7B6850
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0xEF614A66

0x0F7B6850
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x774F88DE
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0x9B968530

0x0F7B6850
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x56AFAF44
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0x9A126F30

0x0F7B6850
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x0C3DADC0
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x3DC7B6E7

0x0F7B6850
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x39CF4C5F
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0xB7972FDC
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x18F7B258
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x7ED94ED5
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x009173E3
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0x7BBA4443
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0xC67324F4
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0x9FCB8BAE
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0xC85E1AA4
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x072E158E
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x769DA929
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x9D78B996
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x4ACED6FC
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x81520A3F

0x0F7B6850
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0xC3D20B05
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xBD223DB1
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x92EF2621
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0x4C4DA9E7
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x95AAFA58
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0xCA50F3AB
of my nature.
0x194BADC3

0x0F7B6850
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x86E7E95E
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x773FE968
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x2E18923C
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x45944456
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0xD2D85B40
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0x72D31544
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0xDA623BF5
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0x263137AD
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x71D28D00
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x4C47D4FC
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x1214CD9F
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0x675E9632
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0xC1901E60
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0xC7A7B10B
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0x48CBF878
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0xF6024633
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0xE6862207
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x730DF853

0x0F7B6850
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xA9400654
to lunch!"
0xB007DD9F

0x0F7B6850
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xAB178432
came tripping down the path.
0x1780786C

0x0F7B6850
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0xEC2E35B1
called?"
0x132CE3BD

0x0F7B6850
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0xB6E3E17B
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x24F488B5
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0x4BE3B9DF
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x5E48B65D
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x73FE914F
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0xA6ED451C

0x0F7B6850
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0xB2A37942
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xDC8F92E0

0x0F7B6850
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0x92DD3CD0
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x3C9C0AFE
suppose?"
0xE18E32FD

0x0F7B6850
I nodded.
0xAC78D1FB

0x0F7B6850
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x291AF0B6

0x0F7B6850
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0xB0D4F5DC

0x0F7B6850
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0xE94E6001
be bolder."
0x23764969

0x0F7B6850
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x1F1DEC75

0x0F7B6850
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x75A9E3D1
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0xFFC501E8
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x2C920996
for you."
0x2BBA3763

0x0F7B6850
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0x46EF85B5

0x0F7B6850
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x5212B7EF
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0xE9FAA5FC
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0x7CED3F99
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0xD5B84DCC
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x424ED04B
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0xD4ED3C94

0x0F7B6850
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x2E0B2B98

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0xA9EFF65A
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x9B22D8F3
provoking."
0x23E6C679

0x0F7B6850
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0x05F7D29A
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0xE4A03215
dread."
0xB20456A2

0x0F7B6850
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x84AEADB1

0x0F7B6850
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x57D7BAC2

0x0F7B6850
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0xBE69C71F
others."
0xF77F7166

0x0F7B6850
"You don't show it."
0x65CB1DDA

0x0F7B6850
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xDC716EA1
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x11C089EA

0x0F7B6850
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x586D6969
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x42B1BDFD
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x48734DE6

0x0F7B6850
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0x82102391

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0xEA96F11C

0x0F7B6850
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x1D740B8B
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0xC9D1667E
you'd _rather_ not."
0x07E76E0F

0x0F7B6850
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0xA5B03731
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x82C21E8B
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xB00FB92D
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0xEB911471
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0xD1BA6469

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER V
0xFB358560

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0xCB6D72DE
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x3105D891
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x5A135484
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0xBECB2726
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0x3CD8FCCF
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0xD27EAA90
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x2DFA703E
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x2313A753
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xEB88C7F9
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0xCEE9FE66
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xDB3F1835
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0xF225DDDE
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0x687FECC6
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x598A4599
bye?"
0x8D7926AC

0x0F7B6850
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x84ED1E0C
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x3C2637C6
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0xEA668253
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x141F890A

0x0F7B6850
"What did you say, Miss?"
0xFE4CAFF9

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x914B2647
the wall."
0x0E7E448B

0x0F7B6850
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x9D70840D

0x0F7B6850
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0xB8187ECE
been my foe."
0x4F775CBE

0x0F7B6850
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xEECCB1C8

0x0F7B6850
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0x014FFABA
out at the front door.
0xAFAD0CE4

0x0F7B6850
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x2F4C5192
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0xA891C311
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0x22B60DA7
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x7352B7B4
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0xCF205D57
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x1C7B5AA2
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0x1A0184FF
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xE7E7087C
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x3EBAF397

0x0F7B6850
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x8C96F652

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"And how far is it?"
0xC41D7860

0x0F7B6850
"Fifty miles."
0x410136F9

0x0F7B6850
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x0B1FD0D4
alone."
0x55155755

0x0F7B6850
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xAE57DF4F
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x16067247
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0x7F70C946
with kisses.
0xD31CBF15

0x0F7B6850
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0xB7DD77DD
me into the inside.
0x7D0010FF

0x0F7B6850
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xB2B1FB09
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0xA01E7A08
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0xEA1E1294
mysterious regions.
0xDC201234

0x0F7B6850
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x8E04D9B4
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x43C45C00
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x26918E97
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xDF2DDEB6
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x646FD24E
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x49C0984F
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xF9244FC7
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0xBA30D895
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x4D28ADCD
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0xB5A8AEEA
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x8A0CC2D4
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xCDCD84FA
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0x8C73A5C2
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0x367A2A33
"stony street" of L-.
0x3B3B295E

0x0F7B6850
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0xF9341880
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x80F1E0DF
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x5352AF77
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0xA054AC98
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x961E7887
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x78B9CA3D

0x0F7B6850
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x3B8D30F8
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x0397EC54
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x8DDD35A5
by the light of the lamps.
0x4F5A3338

0x0F7B6850
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x9028015E
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x00E69C8C
instantly drove away.
0xBA008A8E

0x0F7B6850
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0xF5445C6B
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x7020A195
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0xE05AD3EA
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0xC5E12123
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x656601A0
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0xE2AFE4C7
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0x5BB4274A
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x118771AD
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x7298FC50

0x0F7B6850
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x3A8F2595
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0x2299F985
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x3F73722C
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0xE12ABF89
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0xFD584015
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0xDC16F231
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0xCD926FDE

0x0F7B6850
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0x5DBA0012
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0xC22988C0
grave, her bearing erect.
0x62B09B44

0x0F7B6850
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0xDF9CEACA
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x031D1DCA
then further added--
0x94FD2078

0x0F7B6850
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0x5BBE0C7F
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x552A79A8

0x0F7B6850
"A little, ma'am."
0x3F77ABEC

0x0F7B6850
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0xA925FFC2
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0x034E343F
come to school, my little girl?"
0x2757482E

0x0F7B6850
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x64077DF0
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0xD6F5AF3E
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x37003D0A
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x5DE24D55
me along with Miss Miller.
0x0632F261

0x0F7B6850
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x97E037E8
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x4B6F58DF
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0xF5677C94
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x45D456AF
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0xEE1CEB79
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xD5E1FDD9
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x565BB773
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x5144BB1E
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0x6EEA5D49
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0xC60A6B31
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x02E4DE96
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0xD919C928
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x2E449292
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0xA9C61EA4
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0xA3D453D7
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x08905512
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x4E7A4695
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0xEEA44A15

0x0F7B6850
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x31C78867
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x78925A56

0x0F7B6850
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0x87972743

0x0F7B6850
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xA56839A7
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x535F9686

0x0F7B6850
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0x36E3BC94

0x0F7B6850
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x7497326A
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x273A2EED
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xC2C8A417
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x607075FE
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0xF3D202C9
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x202953F5
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x5B55127E

0x0F7B6850
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x0E9064E7
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0xCA0C8B0E
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0xA8ED4C6F
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0xB88E577D
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x5A2C0D46
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x0D7661FE
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x0B37593F
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0xC1BA9D62

0x0F7B6850
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0xC1E26DCA
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x45B7C871
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x915D6FB0
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x710687A8
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0xCBE7B9FF
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x9F21F63A
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x7284C68C
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x9C2A1BE1
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x93B1EE8A
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0xF6A5B8D3
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x304B7036
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x30C93F4E

0x0F7B6850
"Form classes!"
0x04119F5A

0x0F7B6850
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0xE2696E3F
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x8FBA2ABB
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x9915CF2B
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xEB821E5B
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0xD7C49C21
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0x4B668806
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0xB9625AFE

0x0F7B6850
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0xAEF70626
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0xE9B7CA2C
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0x8B85711B
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xEC53B96C
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x8DB10BD8

0x0F7B6850
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0xD5F71C24
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0xF777E0E5
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x6A0E010C
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0xC1EA01B5
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x3EDF5536
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0x9BB065B0
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x92CCE9A2
little the day before.
0x474D9AE8

0x0F7B6850
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x7E942467
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0x453A5BD1
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0xE507CF06
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0xD1F404C0
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0xF91370A3
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x0E5470C5

0x0F7B6850
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x1B0A5E3B

0x0F7B6850
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x60CA92D1
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0xA4A9FEB7
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xF0812F0B
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x850A264E
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x2A2D41EC
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x5E146323
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x523783B2
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x8C91BD65
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0xD7521011
the meal began.
0x9F872D0A

0x0F7B6850
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0x5EED7EE6
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x5896452F
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x4DF60F8B
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0x06DCB2EF
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xAB3F5A85
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x3D7955AD
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x516F4666
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0x306FA601
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0xA4BEA9C0
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x3E5BBE38
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x155B7BC0
them, the stout one, whispered--
0xD8FA448A

0x0F7B6850
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x451ED377

0x0F7B6850
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0xFB4AC090
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x18D762DB
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xEC2B807F
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x1815BB0C
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x664AD5FF
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0xBCC0EDD5
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0xD22A9DF3
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x5513E639
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x61934712
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0xCE72989E

0x0F7B6850
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x9D123BE4
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x9198447D

0x0F7B6850
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x1C875896

0x0F7B6850
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0xFF704A9A
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0xDCD94A5E
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x7749E770
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x8B84B1F7
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x5DB6D05D
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x687A1A82
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xD4A6DC5D
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x436BAC63
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0x0B67E7E1
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x426EBCCD
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0x8AADB7B3
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xFDF9171C
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x24B43535

0x0F7B6850
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x1B6EDCFD
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x7CAE5602
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x36E49C12
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x573701E8
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0xBCFB02BF
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x22DA7EE5

0x0F7B6850
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0xD44F8CCF
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x28338C38
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0xFFEDACB6
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x66385D0C
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0x9F809419
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0xF940F38A
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0xBD4B46B2
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0xCA27AC60

0x0F7B6850
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x19B7D0F3

0x0F7B6850
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0xD4A1DA43
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xD3FFD04E
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x7A0EE9B5
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0xC5BEB233
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0x92472EE0
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0x9D90A9A7
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0xB1C3D54A
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x60F0007B
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0xA54E42CD
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x6A19572C
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x1825071C
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xE7A2A6F8
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xDEBCD1DD
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x6789A626
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x3310D5D9
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0xA0A0FDBB

0x0F7B6850
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0xD68FFBF8
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0x3BA18915
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x3912EF83
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0xEF09AF1B
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x39380DCC
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0xC54953C4
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0xC3F1DD54
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x0BDD7ACF

0x0F7B6850
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xFF7E9DEC

0x0F7B6850
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x3217EFB6
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x0473A5CB

0x0F7B6850
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x8C11614C
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x70ED776F
to all."
0x7E890533

0x0F7B6850
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x002CBA53

0x0F7B6850
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x7F065985
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xBA3D6B6E

0x0F7B6850
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0xE06CC392
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x7B270C72
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x56E4045A
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x8C05488D
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0xB87C09BD

0x0F7B6850
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x78631A58
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x7ED84318
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x31040CCE
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0x16EF95ED
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0x7C5A11E8
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0x08C22899
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xB53750B6
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x33536E8E
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xDDB92DDD
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0xC99CF86D
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0x356F2C7A
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x3432991F
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0xB3034451
hollow cough.
0xEDA6796C

0x0F7B6850
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x1472960E
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0xBD5351D0
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x64D238EF
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0xBDD1840D
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xC26FE5BC
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0xAFEF7525
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x72EFF9DF
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x19E0436E
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x59294368
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x01A57062
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0xD367F767
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x6B916B5C
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xF2E1F4D0
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0xDFBC2C9F
this inscription:--
0x6955B13F

0x0F7B6850
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0xE661CA1C
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0xCE9731D3
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x3798B32E
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x803F0B53

0x0F7B6850
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x074F9714
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0x9E7738AC
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x394DD202
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0xEDC4081D
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x7400D017
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0xB7B0E5D7
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x7AD5B034
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0xDCE50220
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0xDD71EECC
I said to her directly--
0x4560ED34

0x0F7B6850
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0x6ED387BF
her to lend it to me some day.
0x37E9C39A

0x0F7B6850
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0xA821CD51
she examined me.
0xA7108AA8

0x0F7B6850
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x38A312C8
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0xF3187C8F
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x02A219E4
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x68329076
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x7A040A73
or substantial.
0xEF986EE9

0x0F7B6850
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x796363A1

0x0F7B6850
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0x9A4C7854
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0xF3D0DB53
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x7BA30A8A
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0xB5E01DD1
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x328F0C4B
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0x03A1A254

0x0F7B6850
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0x482F650E
is Lowood Institution?"
0x83069886

0x0F7B6850
"This house where you are come to live."
0x47FB1C23

0x0F7B6850
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0xDAB50BE3
other schools?"
0x61208DAE

0x0F7B6850
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0x7501B537
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x30E01159
father or your mother dead?"
0x7417DFC5

0x0F7B6850
"Both died before I can remember."
0x7FAE80DC

0x0F7B6850
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
0xCF5DAEB7
is called an institution for educating orphans."
0x8FF9E584

0x0F7B6850
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
0x8061DA56

0x0F7B6850
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
0x0A288770

0x0F7B6850
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
0xB6B5ED0B

0x0F7B6850
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
0xE03B37FE
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
0xF6ABE3EB

0x0F7B6850
"Who subscribes?"
0x6F1DA173

0x0F7B6850
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
0xE2E89A33
and in London."
0x3230E065

0x0F7B6850
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
0x07AE9A0D

0x0F7B6850
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
0x31244D86
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
0x68A41A52

0x0F7B6850
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0x0F7B6850
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
0x28B0411A

0x0F7B6850
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
0x73C27034
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
0x0CEBB0B1

0x0F7B6850
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
0x67EDDDAA
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
0x5CF70696
all our clothes."
0x529D23F2

0x0F7B6850
"Does he live here?"
0x1DC7209A

0x0F7B6850
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
0xA25D31A3

0x0F7B6850
"Is he a good man?"
0x07A44FFE

0x0F7B6850
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
0xE06DBE42

0x0F7B6850
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
0x08253E70

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"And what are the other teachers called?"
0xB8A2D4F2

0x0F7B6850
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
0x530FD62E
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0xC5DDEDB4
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0x39F9E852
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0x274AD6B6
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0x75488CF7
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0x60293452
teaches French."
0x0DE7B5A0

0x0F7B6850
"Do you like the teachers?"
0xF57478B6

0x0F7B6850
"Well enough."
0x2476EFE4

0x0F7B6850
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
0x4F711A34
pronounce her name as you do."
0xF1C7BBCE

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
0xB331EE25
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
0x116CBB99

0x0F7B6850
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
0x24B33B7F

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
0x02FFF4D6
she knows far more than they do."
0xCC2F8124

0x0F7B6850
"Have you been long here?"
0x2EFF20D8

0x0F7B6850
"Two years."
0x1FE6A7C2

0x0F7B6850
"Are you an orphan?"
0xF7AA8714

0x0F7B6850
"My mother is dead."
0x341C2283

0x0F7B6850
"Are you happy here?"
0x22795BD7

0x0F7B6850
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x59FF6E6A
the present: now I want to read."
0xD5F95F46

0x0F7B6850
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0x388C7DE7
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x3705DD8C
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0x6EA80EFB
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x1BAE8575
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0xD237451D
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0x1081EACC
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0xBB5573D6
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x35E825B5
day's fare would be like this.
0xF37FD963

0x0F7B6850
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x2FAA4520
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0xB628BD08

0x0F7B6850
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x0765ED54
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x57B61245
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x3A266A99
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x336D1B7E
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x769C56E7
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0xFC42CE9F
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0xE6DCB2A8
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0xC54B7510
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x30DF875A
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0x17FFA18D
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x9DAD7605
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x4A0AB814
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0x88CC52DD
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x57F9C0FE
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0xF51FB421
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xBE57C832

0x0F7B6850
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xF7FB3DB6
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xE0081F5E
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x4C3BB1DA
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x21C835B0
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x8EB9BDB5
first day at Lowood.
0xC70DC44F

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER VI
0x1CD968EE

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0xF293B644
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0xB5202575
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0x9A5E76BE
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x0FBBA2B1
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x0A7B5896
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xC71DAF66

0x0F7B6850
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x7D1963BE
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0xA1AA0B03
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x5D5F85C1
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0xBF93674E

0x0F7B6850
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x58992DA4
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x75B86204
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x2059BB01
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0x1A81395B
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0xC9123D34
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x39405BDB
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x831075B0
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x5EB0FC63
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x478B74C4
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x07CD4370
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0xC9D5AA07
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x12C2279D
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0x20C3D863
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x5E120118
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x0B740F77
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0xB8EA4217
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xC75AA00C
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x9629F7EE
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x77DA4198
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x8070DF9F

0x0F7B6850
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x641EE634
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xAF30729D
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x07E79A71
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0x399B1795
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0xCABA614B
&c. &c.
0xA2B8B717

0x0F7B6850
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x0CAFC39E
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x0A027280
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0xFA0BB362
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0x7C7820B4
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x47BD204E
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xB82A6C74
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0xC2191BE3
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x0D6DC728

0x0F7B6850
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x8C4C74DB
morning!"
0xE0C4DAA5

0x0F7B6850
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0xCFF590AF
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x93CAE569
as the water was frozen?"
0x694945EE

0x0F7B6850
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xDA9BBAD7
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0xD41520B6
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0xE0A5B622
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x18D840F3
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x5862084C
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xC638EBD4
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x5D676596
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0x6AAECF83
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0xB2BB6F4D
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xF4FB737A
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xB6A21350
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0xA41F48BF
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0xDF957E70
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x5C493476
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x6A4CAB5E
altered its ordinary expression.
0x5774DA3F

0x0F7B6850
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x9C0D4EC0
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x5C6417E8

0x0F7B6850
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x4503770A
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0xFCC08C62
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0xD2606B03

0x0F7B6850
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x974C1E28
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0xDFBD0F5A
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x4D68A5E1
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x080D1542
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x194C33EB
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0xF10BEC8C
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x0C97DBA5
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xD95093F0

0x0F7B6850
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x933E728D
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x29C9A197
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0xA39F0E68
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x246DE657
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0xDCE38D4F
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x91435F0A
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x40BFFE3A

0x0F7B6850
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x54AECE12
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x58F98CC4
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x51DD6F7F
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x88C8A292
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x5E9D487C
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0x67BAFAC8
to clamour.
0xE264C8B3

0x0F7B6850
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x950D77E7
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x0584D75A
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x5D8506BA
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0x455DC234

0x0F7B6850
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x5736A055

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0xE97A85D5

0x0F7B6850
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x779C6CBE
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0xDF466CBC
floor.
0xFFDDE07C

0x0F7B6850
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x7ECE497C

0x0F7B6850
"Helen."
0x1EA4866A

0x0F7B6850
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0xB09E19E5

0x0F7B6850
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x23E58764

0x0F7B6850
"Will you ever go back?"
0x0C471C40

0x0F7B6850
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x1939DC6E

0x0F7B6850
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x9E499AAF

0x0F7B6850
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0xA409429D
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0xD30A4099

0x0F7B6850
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x479E6223

0x0F7B6850
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0xC653A5DB

0x0F7B6850
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0xE0560A12
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x8A68EE7C
break it under her nose."
0x60390C6E

0x0F7B6850
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x3F14FF4D
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0xE0A1CECE
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0xCAF7C77C
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x313CD377
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0xA87E0859
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0xAC18E9AC

0x0F7B6850
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xBE71CB09
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0x4F39C290
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0xA8928FE3

0x0F7B6850
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0xDF349ABD
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0xC837EBF0
required to bear."
0x38D206B3

0x0F7B6850
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0xA4D9EB8A
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x396D8BD6
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0xD17C855C
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0xF9A4AE93
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0xA3CEABBA
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x4BA00FCE

0x0F7B6850
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0xB24C21BA
good."
0xB76B9A58

0x0F7B6850
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x8C448ED7
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x384A6C33
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xCF81821F
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0xE50A3E60
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0xC570344D
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0x1C8DD0B0

0x0F7B6850
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0xB566FC98
addition: she kept silence.
0xB8A012B1

0x0F7B6850
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x9C307180

0x0F7B6850
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0xDB8F10FA
grave face.
0x3F55C898

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x0C96D32C
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x8498836D
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x89A15F71
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x1DD78DE3
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0x34F21BE4
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0xA8A982D9
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0xED31E65F

0x0F7B6850
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x06FC49DF

0x0F7B6850
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0xF655752E
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0x10FC2CF5
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xE7892886
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0xAE95FA06
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0x272CA30D
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x284451BE
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xAB531F7B
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0xB1F068D5
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0xE5F4F013
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x004EB43F
answer ready."
0x51BD9836

0x0F7B6850
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0xD29F1506

0x0F7B6850
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xC1043661
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x178AA83C
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x91239628
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0xBAC56B25
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0xD6C48945
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x22665AC4
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x90126A2A
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0xEEEB94C5
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0xE8AE0D48
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0xE8FB3E2C

0x0F7B6850
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0x6646B6C5
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x4B3E5021
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x131F075C

0x0F7B6850
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0x3CF68F86

0x0F7B6850
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0xE5DE97A0
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x85D0A78F
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x74100DF2
I wished to gain."
0x5595F19F

0x0F7B6850
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0xE31125F3

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0xF30B2DFF
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0x9E047314

0x0F7B6850
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0xA67ADB95
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x1A00626D
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x75CB4B2D
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0x9FDA8DE2
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x278AFBD7
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0xEA4E04D8
person who struck us never to do it again."
0xE8C4E58A

0x0F7B6850
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
0x6FA3B643
but a little untaught girl."
0xD5C7E9D3

0x0F7B6850
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
0x30CE4EE2
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0x55846CEB
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0xB2A26E6F
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
0x0DEAA269

0x0F7B6850
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
0x4E944A41
civilised nations disown it."
0xAD6781F7

0x0F7B6850
"How?  I don't understand."
0xE8D8AC5E

0x0F7B6850
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
0x018F0370
certainly heals injury."
0xE834984D

0x0F7B6850
"What then?"
0xEE55D952

0x0F7B6850
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
0x8E11152D
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
0xF5399CC8

0x0F7B6850
"What does He say?"
0xD9103BA0

0x0F7B6850
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
0xA6F78463
you and despitefully use you."
0xB9057386

0x0F7B6850
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
0xD2C3F0BF
John, which is impossible."
0x2734FC99

0x0F7B6850
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0x523622B7
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0xC22146B6
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0xABDEFB7E
softening.
0x4B8E79C0

0x0F7B6850
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0x71F71347
remark, but she said nothing.
0xD1225466

0x0F7B6850
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0xE98E8E62
woman?"
0x2639C9CF

0x0F7B6850
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0xFD517A5A
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0xA3E3E48D
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x0B6CD73F
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x3E28C8C2
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0xCFDEC37C
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0x60545F6C
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x6F1BFBFB
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x0B6167C5
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x9D093AF9
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0x962C442A
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x0AEC7007
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0xAA0D08BF
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0xC760A5FB
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0xD31034CF
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0x9D13CC37
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0xD75A8EA3
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xCD9A0AF7
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x421E8E0F
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0xD1B6AB7B
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xBE5A59AC
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0xD6A2952D
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0xC7EABE96
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0x5C573726
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x69FEAA5B
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
0x93030CE2

0x0F7B6850
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0x272A521F
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xE7CE1436
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0xDBC7D4E4
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x9B7D8CE8
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0xC3F97240

0x0F7B6850
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x3337DD75
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
0x91310C80

0x0F7B6850
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0x59707F8A
without reply as without delay.
0x3D56713C

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER VII
0xD8A2F0DB

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x363762F2
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x0EAA9978
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x055C3442
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x182FC3F5
were no trifles.
0x9537F20D

0x0F7B6850
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0x0AC7BBA3
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x146C8078
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0xB042BD11
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x4E90CD70
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0xB9C3F202
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0xF82F70C0
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x2D2ED597
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x34C5D9D5
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x67B29654
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x2C76E199
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0xD0C1BB73
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0xB99EE0A0
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0xB68CA0B5
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x789377EB
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xD4AC17E0
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x65AAC388
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0xD97BECF9
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x39CC693C
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x26274D49

0x0F7B6850
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x156763FF
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0xB0F97469
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0xDEB9FF78
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x78353731
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x1CE76B20
meals, was served round between the services.
0xBB9F3EDD

0x0F7B6850
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x7E13BC8F
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xC1FC92B9
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x7A4EC18E

0x0F7B6850
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x4ABEC5E5
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0x1BD3255D
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x981B726C
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0xC4B84C7A
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0xD1C185AE
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0xE8B84FC4

0x0F7B6850
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0xBF5080D1
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0xBFC75D29
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0xFFB0B90F
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xBA27E98B
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x60AB0DE5

0x0F7B6850
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x94AC63AC
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x6AC7BB46
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0x08CBD8DC
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x0BC6CC6F
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x2C43AB8D
invariably obliged to part with.
0x50E97A51

0x0F7B6850
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x45595C96
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x9EDCABAC
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xD943F847
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x660647DF
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x6D539CDB
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x95C7A8FF
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x37A5AC52
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x9DC80330
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x81918BFA
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0xB0B52540
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xE1418663

0x0F7B6850
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0xB9237024
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0xCE169559
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0xC4635AD9
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0xC0CC9F72
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0xF136DF7D

0x0F7B6850
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0x388A5D1C
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0x0558F044
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x69DCA3FC
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0xD7C1E0B3
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x6735969C
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x728070AD
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0xBD9847F8
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0xA5331590
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0x73828748
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0xB141C5CC
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0xB803A984
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0xE79E783C

0x0F7B6850
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0x8275C872
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x56AA9107
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0x2114F733
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xB91DA5F6
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0x7122E6CE
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0xBACEF4E8
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0xCA482D18

0x0F7B6850
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x52C1A77F
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0xCA05DD6A
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x6026F3DB
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0x97DDE099
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0xE17B903B
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xBF554798

0x0F7B6850
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x94DC89F5
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x0E54BE47
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x8C42837C
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x77BEFE0E
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xFB2B90C4
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x5D6674E0
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x5B9BF364
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x6F91D6A2
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x317D8E2B
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0xD4771DD7
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0xDBA2C6C4

0x0F7B6850
He paused.
0x14C3B008

0x0F7B6850
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x10B4179E

0x0F7B6850
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0x17743A98
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x3E37067E
to one."
0x9075B59D

0x0F7B6850
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x7C4449B7
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0xEE376F49
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x6B64825F
occasion."
0xCEA67F40

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0x6366245A

0x0F7B6850
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0x5F5B0D0B
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0xF6DF79E1
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x6A0B8A49
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x267898C2
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0xA47E68AC
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0x6EED0247
what authority?"
0x615A7551

0x0F7B6850
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xF2C73DEC
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x316BCCAF
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0x9FEDAA8F

0x0F7B6850
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x94F299BA
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0xC860E563
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x682B55A3
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x1751D23A
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0x46D57486
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0xF09A6EC9
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0xEFC1247F
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0xAFF8F92C
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0x93E3B2C5
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0xCC9CAE32
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0xF75D6189
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xC4967087
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x208FA310
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x14CEAAF1
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0xB4E4AF9B
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x27678302
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x37E770F2
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0xEEA18E75
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x5DB9E0EC

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x123B6C8D
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0xB45A2065
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x153501BD
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x35AA69FD
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0xDC614B33
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x4FBD7B30
severity.
0x44956586

0x0F7B6850
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0x95D98517
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x14355CEC
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x43881095
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xD4AA859F

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0x279558E9
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x232B4003
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0xE713BC12

0x0F7B6850
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0xE3F72708

0x0F7B6850
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x58719C08
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x26529BD8
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xC5DFC844
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x61F51748

0x0F7B6850
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x86D7566B

0x0F7B6850
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0x0BAF9477
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x067FC115
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x69CDAAF0
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x66DC1AFD
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x28B7A30F
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x22E2E2DA
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0x8F819667

0x0F7B6850
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0xA2C29994
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x2CAEC284
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x3D773203
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0xF0338A74
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x826F212F
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0xEEF1592F
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0xAC05239C
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x02B15C1B

0x0F7B6850
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x999EFD4A
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0xEB1D975E

0x0F7B6850
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x7C694D4A

0x0F7B6850
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0x2E448E44

0x0F7B6850
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xFF7173C7
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0xB9E253A8
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0xE0379BD8
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0x1F9493BB
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x8D4E2F63
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x88CAB441
time wasted, of--"
0x5AEC0DF7

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x481D6F2F
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x7D48CAA2
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x83EEFCE4
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x75D657EB
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x91938FA6
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0xD8194E35
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x751983A3
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x062800D0
false front of French curls.
0xA8350598

0x0F7B6850
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0xBB78BEFE
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x7B7E8E22
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x3C4B45D2
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0xE640E01C
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0xA48CADE1
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0xF90F0F6B
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x1EC895D2
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0xCDAF70A3
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x20D4DB54
my attention.
0xBB25B4CD

0x0F7B6850
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0xD551FBCD
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x61049175
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0xB36B73F0
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0x87223EEF
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0xDB81C7D0
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x34B830A3
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0x16E65242
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0x230A4B33
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x911B049E
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x421CCE3B

0x0F7B6850
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x2B97B0EF
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0xA3D9572E
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0xA05D7B41
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x4433381D

0x0F7B6850
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x808BC732
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x27D58C5B
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x3E2D97B8
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0x556413C8

0x0F7B6850
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0xC7A70359
punished."
0xED7C03C7

0x0F7B6850
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0xD32AE37A

0x0F7B6850
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0xC5DCF98D
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x7083D0BD
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0xB1D7662B

0x0F7B6850
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0xEC454330
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x1FC9ACBF

0x0F7B6850
"Place the child upon it."
0xE765C916

0x0F7B6850
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x2C12ADD3
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x03D688B8
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0xF6DB4E9A
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x741A0367
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x9F964E35

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x57DD402F

0x0F7B6850
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0xD704789D
children, you all see this girl?"
0x13A7EA79

0x0F7B6850
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x22F452F2
against my scorched skin.
0x3A3BCC27

0x0F7B6850
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x43D0B935
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x2D52EACE
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x55BB0304
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0xD8DF0A14
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x89EF6B1C

0x0F7B6850
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xAE2D048E
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0x1CC2E807
must be firmly sustained.
0xEB9EB5E4

0x0F7B6850
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0x03C0B7DF
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x8FDC9951
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0xB93CC2AE
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0x47347A88
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x04B0A85A
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0xAEB06CFF
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x1721E225
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x57D364CB
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xFA1DA6E9
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x027BA42C
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0xA8BF1FA0
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x1ABC6240

0x0F7B6850
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x8EC9E0C9
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0xDE38DC9B
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x0EDA1850
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x94874151
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0x0E068E15

0x0F7B6850
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x86AAEF4A
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0xC457DDAF
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xA2A26FB8
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0x00E49280
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x5739078A
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0xCF82DCDB
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x8E8869A3
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0xA097D6FF
waters to stagnate round her."
0x3D1B3096

0x0F7B6850
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x75591F48
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0xFA859A03
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x81EF560D
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x891B8B46

0x0F7B6850
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x17E934D1
her during the remainder of the day."
0x9D63BEC4

0x0F7B6850
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x85316836
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x97378576
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x5D683DE7
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0x3FBAE6C8
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x0668BCD9
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x66B1284E
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xD3758C83
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0x1A112AAC
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0xDA254EC7
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x6CECD023
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x8A245BD5
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0xA076BE2E
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0xC43E94D2
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x5464282D
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x1A1625F2
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x7B82DB81
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0xCBA7AAFD
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xFD1928B4
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0xCB22600C
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xA5FD2F63
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x5FCBE15A
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0x104D83C8

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0xEC5C6CF6
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0xFB1552F0
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x56A80B44
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x25ED0011
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0xD9AA8726
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xAE513173
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x0808A967
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x18793B28
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x8B867DC1
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0x07E38829
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x1C6C8CBB
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0xFD3FF1AC
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0xED9483BC
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0xF7C3ADF1
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0xD834708F
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xE6666414

0x0F7B6850
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x69044620
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x1A178B50
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x53E6F89B
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x8633F631

0x0F7B6850
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x20973D0B
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0xCCEC315C
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x6278FF6B
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x50740234
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0x827D381E
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0xF5B2242D
first who spoke--
0x3FD1359A

0x0F7B6850
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0x421FE405
liar?"
0x53A400EB

0x0F7B6850
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x39898BFE
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x780A90B4

0x0F7B6850
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0x305CDB98

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0xE8AEE652
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0x490B8844

0x0F7B6850
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x949D692D

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x58D0C065
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x87D90F38
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0xB31C17A0
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x30B48A1C
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0xE81F341B
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x44940D40
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0xFC81E5EC
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0xF42FEFBE
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0xC0F140D5

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x31CF7785
gently to warm them, and went on--
0x2BACFF5B

0x0F7B6850
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x412B2835
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x13EE86C6
without friends."
0xCD80E066

0x0F7B6850
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0xAE35BB2D
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0x356E7FB2
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xC7FBA9E5
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x6F0DF83B
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x92A4F549
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x40EF7179

0x0F7B6850
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x34BF4E68
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x4AE1D4EA
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x160C8E3A
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x3A9DF4B7
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x5524E43C
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0xF9C8B6CA
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x6D198969
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0xAC964E8F
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x1BD8358E
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x472C66BF
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0xAD623324
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0xD8FC8FEC
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x6F65AACE
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0xB6E0C92A
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xB29EB0E3

0x0F7B6850
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0xD60D87D8
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x0858AA75
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0x14034899
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0xD9224A92
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x410DFE0C

0x0F7B6850
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0x5BA60958
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x171F9E6F
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0xEBAF868E
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0x08CC6F4B
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0xA0E26589
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x2C7C4B53

0x0F7B6850
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xBDC1675E
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0xDD504562

0x0F7B6850
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0xDAEE7E19
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x99485DB2
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xC8501A27
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x2F28E7EE
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x2BB313EC

0x0F7B6850
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0xDC6083C1
your grief away?"
0x3D5CD349

0x0F7B6850
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0xA7D448E9

0x0F7B6850
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0x0F7B6850
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x512D4B24
will now think me wicked."
0xE083E03E

0x0F7B6850
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x1FE96117
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0xE5D20D62

0x0F7B6850
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0xE1903D2A

0x0F7B6850
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xECAD6C7B
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x6D863667

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0xE1D03121
care."
0x05FCCCE7

0x0F7B6850
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x7AE6F985

0x0F7B6850
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0x2D610516
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0xA0374ABA
always keep me."
0x33CEA23F

0x0F7B6850
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xBBB029B9
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x7A32E450
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x6C041791
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x3C91BD67
exaggerate nothing."
0xBB0B398A

0x0F7B6850
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x200FEDB6
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0xC21E7386
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0x8C527B70
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0xF027A128
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0xCF511830
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x821BFCDF
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xB0860481
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x6AD521DB
Temple fully believed me.
0x342696E2

0x0F7B6850
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0x6AB85155
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xC204FB82
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x3A4CAAA4
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x3A9F0CA2
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x0B36B823
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x374E94FF

0x0F7B6850
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x22209FAC
then said--
0xD90003C0

0x0F7B6850
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x1F796E73
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0xB963531B
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0xB78DCDC4

0x0F7B6850
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x186DFA06
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x871D5375
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x8538B465
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0xAAE58FEB
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xB4FBA86B

0x0F7B6850
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x447C4091

0x0F7B6850
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x3AFBD74B

0x0F7B6850
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x44202E45

0x0F7B6850
"It is a little better."
0x696385F6

0x0F7B6850
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x7580D52E
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0x40DE6BDD
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0x45BA84C7

0x0F7B6850
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xE501D88E
rang her bell.
0x98A973F3

0x0F7B6850
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x87CBCED2
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x509DA157

0x0F7B6850
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xB5687A78
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x05DDD492
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x48B4DE27
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0xC70E03FA
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0xBEBAB5F0

0x0F7B6850
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xBB03D5C6
There is not enough for three."
0xE0D31AA9

0x0F7B6850
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xB27D0B3D

0x0F7B6850
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x417841DA

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0xA7E8CA5F
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x140E33A6

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x6BADE876
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0xB35E505D
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0xF41857E5

0x0F7B6850
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0xE88BF1FA
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xCB6985F6
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x02944FF2
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0xF2567C52

0x0F7B6850
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0xE989B3C8
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0xFC101849
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x3E6A9971

0x0F7B6850
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x3EED1C22
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x7C088290
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0xFAD99B9E
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x67081340

0x0F7B6850
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xD5B43C8B
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0x13115088
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0x3D2828FD

0x0F7B6850
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x9C44751E
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x10383910
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0xFB68BED1
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0xF80B2046
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x136ACE90
struck with wonder.
0x64694098

0x0F7B6850
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x5BF7A1A0
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x8AD01AC5
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0xB5A0751C
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0x1C8155C5
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x371ED8E8
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0xE9C226CE
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x8801C52C
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0x4F41B69E
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x260C4AD9
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x914963D5
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xE2D3127F
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0x7F6AAB2B
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x40A989B1
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x70E944A2

0x0F7B6850
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x3F935F36
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x3A27A6EF
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x0DD5A963
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0x3911F7B5
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x26289935
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xAE196DFB
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0xA5ACCDBC
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0xBFA90B22
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0xB89868CC
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xF9006560
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0xDB3350F8

0x0F7B6850
"God bless you, my children!"
0xA4FE9E30

0x0F7B6850
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0x6C467DCB
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x5D0DB7D6
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x683265C4

0x0F7B6850
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x73B3A713
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x99AC05FF
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x08FB2835
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0x8AFC08CF
shoulder.
0x3B02D165

0x0F7B6850
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x3F75DD2D
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x1B0CAD03

0x0F7B6850
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x9AF1FE1C
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0xCBABD9C2
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0xD4B37BE2
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x0DB23D1A
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x6ECB7F93
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0x6BF2FE82
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x887138F6
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0xC458F2C1
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0x8708D087

About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0xB4EA7172
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0xE67E1124
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x32CB91AE
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x5EE5CBA9
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0x7C9508A2
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x395BBF3B
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x61DC516A
through the ranks of my companions.
0xAC9B558F

0x0F7B6850
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x381E029F
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0xCC522E9C
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x64180058
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x175E37DD
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x86A94530
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x7F5BA8D2
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0xD2BDC8E5
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x7B4BFB98
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x553A8725
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x1157F3D6
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x69C5F5EE
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x9523FF18
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0xA9215276
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x2CFEF91F
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0xA828BA7F
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0x85853C4B
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xBE979C28
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x922618CD
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x21C91852
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0xB1A7D5D6

0x0F7B6850
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0x19C9A285
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x933D55DF

0x0F7B6850
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0x57FE9199
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
0x0B207E2F

CHAPTER IX
0x068C7B94

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x45F7B75D
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0xF04AC524
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0x6699FBEE
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0xFA16CFE3
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x3D329A0F
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x97E6EECA
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x2EF2289D
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x73F49763
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0xCB234CFD
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x783F0166
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x1E4F8C7D
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x4D9B2208
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x06DB43F7
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x341FA2F3

0x0F7B6850
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xE7257756
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x2FF78492
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x931FF976
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x54F0431E
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x8167201E
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x75B41D08
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0xC080208B
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xA951DA17
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0xE1FEA92A
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0xBF946792
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x0D6A81E8
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x39C1D3BC
of skeletons.
0xC624E4D5

0x0F7B6850
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x70D2A056
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x890466D7
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x9012A824
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x13FAC87E
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0xF08C5BA9
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xFBE8086C
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0x73617997
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0x0A21718D
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x965013D5
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x2CB21A3B
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x2669DBF3
advert.
0x79DF12BE

0x0F7B6850
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x02C31CDF
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x95EB7092
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0xB0F7D473
question.
0x9A94E2A9

0x0F7B6850
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x182D9F12
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xBCBD6CD7
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x566AB176
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0xE17EDCFF
hospital.
0x2F16DE51

0x0F7B6850
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x323AF482
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x15F7CC99
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0xDC6DFDDD
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xE60971D2
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x683B8969
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0xADA0ACB8
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0xAAB612C5
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0xDB3A269C
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x9D07AD3D
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x22956C7F
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xEB125B49
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x9CADA2CA
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xD4E35609
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x8FC5E5AF

0x0F7B6850
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x502C3E13
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x13253C58
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0xB0E2307F
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0x84A98AE9
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0xEBED2A3A
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0xF724244A
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0x6049C425
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0x18CA130F
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0xBC9D9D2F
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0xB148914E
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xDA1FB808
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xD1313D41

0x0F7B6850
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0xA86D20D5
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x5996B833
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x695B5A5F
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0xDC5C59CB
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xF7E4BAEA
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x5163FF05
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x7A0805BF
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x5FC14446
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x3C0C600A
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x3E779264
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x16B98B6E
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x208541FA
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x07E0820D

0x0F7B6850
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x3E174E5D
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x183495CC
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xA43C0CBF
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0xA4132BD9
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xBEC4F89F
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xE58B34EA
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x5C113AD3
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0xFAD786D3
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0xFA924B1B
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x8B281618
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0xFC56A7D7
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x6ECFF7B0
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x915E9396

0x0F7B6850
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0xA8FFF00E
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xCE995E82
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x1FFA92F7
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0xB8674E85
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x325C9681
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x35E24B9F
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x8F6164DD
higher things.
0x8FB680D8

0x0F7B6850
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x26280232
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0x393277B6
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x6289D813
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x2EE545B4
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x4CAD5C3C
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0xF5BE45E5
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x200E37CA
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xBBC01373
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x0EDBB9EE
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x6DCA8E24
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0xFE44720A
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x05A0EB07
alleviate.
0xD7802934

0x0F7B6850
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0x5D12DECD
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x3E7AB6CE
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x55F886AC
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0x30F0A087
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x406A894D
verandah.
0x7D0CD8ED

0x0F7B6850
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x7826EA70
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x27312388
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x0C4F6447
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0xDB7626E3
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0xBD821757
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0xE6DADF5D
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0xDDCDC4F8
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0xBAA5DBF5
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0xB46040E3
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x6AED5186
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x01EF2588
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x965DA171
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xCC6C8E4C
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0xAFB7734F
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x38AA2CF3
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0xEF3FF50F
done before:--
0xF0E35746

0x0F7B6850
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x2FA9E7F6
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x262D384B
have to go who knows where?"
0x219EE4C3

0x0F7B6850
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x839A0B40
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x7F6E551D
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x0353E4F6
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0xBB31C985
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x7552FC02
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x3BFCA63D
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x4949A4A5
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0xCA109C21
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x94A561E8
ran up to her.
0xB3B7EDEC

0x0F7B6850
"How is Helen Burns?"
0xEAD8B984

0x0F7B6850
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0x10D1501D

0x0F7B6850
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x95A55F44

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"And what does he say about her?"
0x8C5FB62D

0x0F7B6850
"He says she'll not be here long."
0xBA523643

0x0F7B6850
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xA77AF600
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x9E61FA93
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0x686B4EB2
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0x112C8937
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0x0E554C1F
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0x13288ECA
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x46D0CDD6
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0xF922BCBB

0x0F7B6850
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0x66D4E940

0x0F7B6850
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x3505C492

0x0F7B6850
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x963DD591
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x62DC1168

0x0F7B6850
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x9D853A29
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x9286EF6D
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xA829E92A

0x0F7B6850
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x3E22E8AE
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0xF392273C
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0xDE0321C6
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x960E3988
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x5FDF8DB9
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x3EF34A49
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x099D25AF
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x28E85554
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0xB3847EBB
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0xE8FEC33B
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0xC1BBCFB0
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x66AB18EA
with her one last word.
0xFCB60470

0x0F7B6850
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x4EC3A9B3
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0x92E5E9D0
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xFB15714C
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0xFD0819FD
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x0C5C39F2
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0x2FB11193
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x1868FC2B
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0xADC730EB
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0xACD06931

0x0F7B6850
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x287AF4CB
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x9B9381A0
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0xECE96E49
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x9BA529B2
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xEF0FE907
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x715C7DD0
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x942A77A3
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0x67CB3B82
of seeing a corpse.
0x97AE98D2

0x0F7B6850
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0x50CFE68B

0x0F7B6850
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0xFE0AC75E
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x13988B54
instantly dissipated.
0xD4850BC4

0x0F7B6850
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xE177DB33

0x0F7B6850
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x460ECEB5
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0x295E0018

0x0F7B6850
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0xFC6777AB
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0xE3843479
old.
0xA0B0BE9A

0x0F7B6850
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xB63269DD
strike some minutes since."
0x9FFB0543

0x0F7B6850
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x807F7DF6
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0xEE156136

0x0F7B6850
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xF6DAA015

0x0F7B6850
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x3CE146F9

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0xE59B2360

0x0F7B6850
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x8FBD424F
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0xEE9C12DC
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x0561A199
whispered--
0xD4350A29

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x5704D1E0
quilt."
0xCFB245EC

0x0F7B6850
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0x5CD57792
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0x377AE458

0x0F7B6850
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xFED38B75
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x1C44CDF1
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0xA8955CD0
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0xC6C2738F
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0x3AC8896C
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x22FDF697
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0x2FC9D1C8
been continually at fault."
0x1C8EB688

0x0F7B6850
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xC1D652DC

0x0F7B6850
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0x72225376

0x0F7B6850
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0xB2C532D3

0x0F7B6850
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0xEC1EB3D4
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0x9CB1BFBE
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x5BB5C7AE
reveal Him to me."
0x5548D178

0x0F7B6850
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0xCA999C88
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xE8C216A3

0x0F7B6850
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0xD19529A7
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x59533D50
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0x5EE8F583

0x0F7B6850
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x7F76A5F5

0x0F7B6850
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0xB52497DB
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x13660CF6

0x0F7B6850
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x74FB56BE
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0xC7BAEA04
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x11EB0D87
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0x2A7B4F8B
tone--
0x3AD49BFC

0x0F7B6850
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0xAABA0FB5
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x7596A534
near me."
0x7CD768D5

0x0F7B6850
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xD7E5819C

0x0F7B6850
"Are you warm, darling?"
0x2A5520E2

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Good-night, Jane."
0xD2ED9EAA

0x0F7B6850
"Good-night, Helen."
0xB34EC22A

0x0F7B6850
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0xAB4949EC

0x0F7B6850
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x22B24E3F
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x249614E0
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x92FE1383
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x20449573
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0x1C2EB15C
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0x82979B2E
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x2E2C1F6D
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xAE30E27A

0x0F7B6850
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xAA9F37AC
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x7969E510
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
0x63965AD8

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER X
0x4CE28B7D

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x42955C30
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0xD98E50AA
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x6B18DD6F
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x9FE74947
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x62341533
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x43D51A2E
connection.
0x8AE1173C

0x0F7B6850
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0x8C5EFB3B
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x2BCC2218
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0xD838D67E
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x304B3A9D
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0xBCAE9F00
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0xF9636A0E
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x0D6963C0
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0xD92BF849
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xB250886C
beneficial to the institution.
0x3E736F51

0x0F7B6850
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x09BAAC45
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x927CD882
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0xA951AF34
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0x22BDC9C0
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0xE821E0C4
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x109F4BDB
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0x514521CC
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0x1C945E99
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0x9A52ACCA
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0xBA8890ED
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x452C7277
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xEC79B7C4
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x26AE6B3E
testimony to its value and importance.
0x3F7CBBE6

0x0F7B6850
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xCDFFEBC2
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x33558D4F
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0x9D4E6FB3
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x8B5DA70E
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0xFDAE5AED
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x7BC128C3
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0x2FB66676
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0x43ECE230

0x0F7B6850
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0xCAC55132
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x5A6BE3E3
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x25188DAD
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xCFAAF1B4
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x0FB01BA2
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x1E54A3BD
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0x9EA66BF3

0x0F7B6850
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x6ACB34F0
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0xB284EDC9
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0xCF882DAA
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x7EAE2AA8
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xA13F0D30
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x4CF7CCD8
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x92DA2CBE
character.
0xEE2C4C5E

0x0F7B6850
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x56AFF9BE
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x74070D14
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x2CAA8881
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0xD05792CA
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x81E1323F
of the occasion.
0xF52C66CD

0x0F7B6850
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0xD4C9658C
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x2EA8B692
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x1D09703C
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0x6ECCD0C4
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0xDCFD8E90
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x6DC5C317
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0xDAA9D63D
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x9180099A
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x09BEF70C
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0x2A60F272
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xD822AB92
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0xBE37B07E
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x9C3FA181
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x2958BD84
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x0717BD74
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x3190FC5E

0x0F7B6850
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0x90345DB6
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x096658F9
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x97837A00
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x8B146137
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0xCEA29070
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x279E2FD4
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x9AE1CAF5
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x7BFBA886
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0xE25FC264
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x66F68F6E
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0x3B7792F0
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x663A9793
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xD9BD7BEA
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xC4E58DFF
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x3705930F
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0xEB338371
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0xD12AECB7
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0xEE9010BD
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xF9511616
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x32414452
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0xC52A4663
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0x9F7FC9D1

0x0F7B6850
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0xDCA21928

0x0F7B6850
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0xE726714C
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x50F62EAB
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x2C011AD6
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x43AB12A3
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0xE1F93C19
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x2EF1C8F8

0x0F7B6850
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0xAD7FC5FE
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0x9117A8A8
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x84FFDC39
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0xEAC677EE
instantly revived.
0x96005B94

0x0F7B6850
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0xFD235204
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0xEBB1B0C4
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x7D758B86
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0xD13CDF82
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x9B4465AA
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0xE8DF1747
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0x1303D142
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0xF2F9FF50
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0xC6DB72B4
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0x3592C535

0x0F7B6850
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x278914AB
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0x3F2A1792
think_ again with all my might.
0x31BB21BC

0x0F7B6850
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x5140EAB4
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0xA075E172
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0x2E0209C3
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x3F53F175
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0xB799B50E
their resource?"
0x3E4E64AD

0x0F7B6850
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x53D995BC
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0xDADA1AA4
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x45387FEA
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xDE7DC035
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0xBBE1138B
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0xC193F76B

0x0F7B6850
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x046C1182
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0x39D64FF0
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x7350F04C
_---shire Herald_."
0x4E06918C

0x0F7B6850
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x9BA4BBA7

0x0F7B6850
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0xC504358C

0x0F7B6850
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0x8794AE11
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0xB53450DD
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0xF68F1B21
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0x11B7D449
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0x36A60153

0x0F7B6850
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0xFDA6BF96
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x4A6CA652

0x0F7B6850
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x536D3F04
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0xD769C845

0x0F7B6850
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0xFA3B39B1
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x905C9D97
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0x6BE38A45
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0xBCD895CE
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xDF01D31E
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0xB3289231
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x15E4C9ED
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
0xEC2FA19C
shire."
0x64CCAE6F

0x0F7B6850
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0xA7AA5170
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0xE408C4D1
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0xB7C0BDBD
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x122D3290
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0xF2260FD6
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x5E4214C1
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0x9D4F9271

0x0F7B6850
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0xFF9DF4B7
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0xC07FFD86
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x90B5483E
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0xB28E02DF
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0x4E752D07
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xCB9D67C3
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0xC9C22EE5

0x0F7B6850
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0xF7A8BA17
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x904E74EB
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0xE55B8985
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0x9DB20198
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0x991540B0

0x0F7B6850
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0x09BAF992

0x0F7B6850
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x98BCC03F
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x29EB1F99
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0xF83579D5
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0xD8CA6C5D
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0x368C7666

0x0F7B6850
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0x52EFD712

0x0F7B6850
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x60A09EFB
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x78500D25
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0x8499AAA3

0x0F7B6850
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x0CFA5039
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x262C858B
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0xE1F20C6B
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0xE8B4C75C
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x6BC894DE
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x11CE2176
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x2EA04FA7
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x1FA448A2
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x359E8CDD
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0xBE4230F0

0x0F7B6850
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0x0D6E3BA1
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0xBBAEE906
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x6508264F
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0xF5587C48
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0x6DC48EEC
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
0x9CB6D4EA
direction:--
0x109EADFE

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0xF40508FF

0x0F7B6850
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0xCE92775C
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0xBD8F6C9B
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0xFA260216
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0xAE5BD4FA
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x26247FD2
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x0C6F8D61
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0x23C44AEF
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0x8BC7098B
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x764F46DA
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0xD724A889
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x61383C83
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x8581CBAB
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x787F3F1C
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0xB33C3BC0
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0xA5161B0C
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0x04D8A8C2
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xB662066C
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x2DB70F25
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0x76321454
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x62868B29

0x0F7B6850
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x5A441A3B

0x0F7B6850
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0xE2DDB86D
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0xADBDDBD3
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x4843C028
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0x4A6D3035
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0xE80C4499
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x772ABD74
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0xA01FC6FE
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x2982D34B
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x8D091109
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x0B9CD233
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x7D0FFE11
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x0A28ADAE
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0x89E5C7EE
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x3B0C0FE5
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0xC69EF27B
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x4792ADFD
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x664507A4
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xBF279766
forthwith be furnished me.
0xF73FD8DF

0x0F7B6850
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x67A4FBF4
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0xDD74CD24
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x1B167F6D
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0xAE07F7E9

0x0F7B6850
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0xDE4739E4
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x3ECBE37B
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x7611B099
years ago from Gateshead.
0xDD66CA30

0x0F7B6850
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x7A004C25
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0xE3C39D24
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0xF8EE293F
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x4A0C1AA4
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x4749C386
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x6151FCC2
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0xFC020D10
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xCC07CFB0
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x4101B536
while the change was being accomplished.
0x464BD75B

0x0F7B6850
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x6398A95C
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0xBC3554E6

0x0F7B6850
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0x1351E2AD
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0xC16A4ADF
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x39159871

0x0F7B6850
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x4E99C07D
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0xF8666F5A

0x0F7B6850
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x78F71C9E
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x92EF7036
complexion.
0x2B0C78B0

0x0F7B6850
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x70F84512
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x75C2018E

0x0F7B6850
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x264FD72F
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x9BD2EC4E
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x1A464695
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0xF17ECE3D

0x0F7B6850
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0xD3928382

0x0F7B6850
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0xA499D18F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x1385E1AB
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x16B9B693

0x0F7B6850
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x9EEEF94F

0x0F7B6850
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0x67B49A03

0x0F7B6850
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x0527203A
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x5954612D
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x76387048

0x0F7B6850
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0x59731A24
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0x0E529FB6
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xBED7FD6B
would make two of you in breadth."
0x956DAF18

0x0F7B6850
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xC2DCE53E

0x0F7B6850
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x6F533E91
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0x5B048DE3
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xC7A0341E
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x333F3EDD
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x714C3AE3
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0xCFD67667
quarrelling--"
0x9BFE61F9

0x0F7B6850
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0xE1AFC274

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xDA7B9989
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0xFBA6760D
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0x8A4C08A9
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0xD167BED3

0x0F7B6850
"What does he look like?"
0x48C3BEE1

0x0F7B6850
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0xA32DDAA1
has such thick lips."
0xBE3C327F

0x0F7B6850
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x1425C09B

0x0F7B6850
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x0FD28C40
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x7B13344B
a deal of money."
0x37CF1C72

0x0F7B6850
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x2F078A8D

0x0F7B6850
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x9F57113A
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0xE04968CE
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0xB275E8C8
you were quite out of my reach."
0x5D380CA5

0x0F7B6850
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x8A688ACB
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xFA8BCA28
shape denote admiration.
0x24F0DE22

0x0F7B6850
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x296F6772
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x6A7362A7
a child."
0x76052DD1

0x0F7B6850
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x4DF83D45
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0xACC61194
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x5630EED4
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x74F61014

0x0F7B6850
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x23721075
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x557A42C2

0x0F7B6850
"A little."
0xE37E75C7

0x0F7B6850
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0xBAB8E789
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x460F1ABA
charmed.
0x25B549EF

0x0F7B6850
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0xED9C2C57
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0xF1B09104

0x0F7B6850
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0x878DA447
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0xD6281B4C
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x1FD28F97
and which she had framed and glazed.
0xED7AB92E

0x0F7B6850
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0xE4B2DF5B
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x325FB697
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0xEC043E9C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0xF4BBF63C

0x0F7B6850
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0x2B39A268

0x0F7B6850
"I can."
0x7EDE15FB

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xB14B1504
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x016E857E
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0xC81C815A
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x92D0C516

0x0F7B6850
"Never in my life."
0x9BDB6ACD

0x0F7B6850
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x17FA7B2B
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x04D4E8A3
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x8B616DD8
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xF33E466F
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x42A96A7F
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0xAEB4F2CB
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0x9B84F55A
father's brother."
0xEBE98816

0x0F7B6850
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0xB4A228DF

0x0F7B6850
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0xCEB104B6
tell me--"
0x60451549

0x0F7B6850
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0x52D53349

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xD49D2F60

0x0F7B6850
"So he went?"
0x4A92724E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x83E03464
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0xBF1ADB5C
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0xFFF6FBE9

0x0F7B6850
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x034CA4A6
wine-merchant."
0xA1D92A4E

0x0F7B6850
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x1EA4AFC1
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0x3FF6B0CA
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0xB669F0B1
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0x812CED50
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0xB99F6BC6
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0xEE74DCB3
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
0x4437FA44

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XI
0xECDCFFDD

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x03265FBC
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x9980BFC9
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0xBE5EA2BF
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x3A5C3288
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x64328617
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0xF6037377
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x3F295754
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xC23E9E09
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xED9AB3B6
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0xB70B6A75
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xCCE252E7
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0xDAEBC063

0x0F7B6850
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0x8AEA1B86
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0xB6BFB654
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0xCFA22A2C
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x5844E599
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x4366E1E7
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x6E16B028
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0xEA9A2DBB
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x2F661B03
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0x39CE4FAB
troubling my thoughts.
0x927EDEEA

0x0F7B6850
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x4B524F20
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x3985203A
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x64834C86
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x4AF7B9ED
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x6D4C67C8
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0xFF0BA9FB
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0xCB8C9E0B
the bell.
0x62105BE3

0x0F7B6850
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x68FB5DDB
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x0523C7B4

0x0F7B6850
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x26C87F5B
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x0985AEC9

0x0F7B6850
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x879A0CFE

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Person here waiting for you."
0xB6D07112

0x0F7B6850
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0xC0DF6F68
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0x6A0C6C9F
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0xE62C7E2F

0x0F7B6850
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0xC9E7409E
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x07B329DB

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0xB06DE098
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0x5F0BB2F9
Thornfield.
0xB086A0F2

0x0F7B6850
"A matter of six miles."
0xD191F84E

0x0F7B6850
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x610F1719

0x0F7B6850
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x7C7061C2

0x0F7B6850
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0xD566E741
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x1A1461B5
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0x07B8E789
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x911EBDCB
much at my ease.
0xF860ED9F

0x0F7B6850
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0xE8A6E326
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0xEC21473A
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x76FFD808
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x7E348465
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xDCFF3D2D
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0xC51D7248
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0xE6A37C67
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x6DDA69CD
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0xEBF37DE4
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x7EDEB53B
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0xB35585E2
road now, I wonder?"
0x8690C293

0x0F7B6850
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x86F86F02
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x3254B2B6
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0x86C5F892
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x6A56FF44
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x3B37DBEB
more stirring, less romantic.
0x6410E0A8

0x0F7B6850
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x2FBD175D
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0xA55746FF
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x08C4FE04

0x0F7B6850
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x22213337

0x0F7B6850
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x330B0E42
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x7AE11CA4
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x095C5778
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x26135145
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x21B899AA
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x3B266240
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0xEB831B13
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0xBFE1CEF2

0x0F7B6850
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x73C85092
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0xCF16EEA4
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0xA19611AA
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0xCF454E50
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x49F149A5
itself to my view.
0xFEF77C88

0x0F7B6850
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x546CCCF4
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x05E96E2B
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0x5D97EB2C
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0xDAB442C5
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x7AFC6A37
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0xA285D094
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x744B47EF
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0x82379593
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x1AC77370
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0xAC5035A2

0x0F7B6850
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xB21D0623
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0xE9056510

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0xD9B23FDA

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0x22EE9B61

0x0F7B6850
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0xBE53BF24
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x9ADC70F5
trouble.
0x4D4E1D6E

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x5D44D7D2
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x19A4B0F1
the keys of the storeroom."
0x97BABDC2

0x0F7B6850
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x65DACB0B
delivered them to the servant.
0xA8A2E50C

0x0F7B6850
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x93FCC53A
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x41187616

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, ma'am."
0x0360FE25

0x0F7B6850
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0xECDCCD39

0x0F7B6850
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xCE751DBB
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x9BD46825
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0xA5FF8490
too soon."
0x59721134

0x0F7B6850
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0xE9C46D9D
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x0CA677EF
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0xE98B40D6
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0xC1CCA618
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x3D3AD2D3
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x1C7C02A3
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xA32C2886

0x0F7B6850
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x927EEF20
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0xC0BDF9EE

0x0F7B6850
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xC0EB44E4
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x62C105EB

0x0F7B6850
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0xCD293310

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0x833BB815
future pupil."
0x0752D5DF

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xA83CEA7F

0x0F7B6850
"No,--I have no family."
0x02E324C7

0x0F7B6850
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x877E2308
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0xC12B4CD2
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x1D43B39E

0x0F7B6850
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x50EAE758
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xFC075C84
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0xA209DD3C
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x6E44D30A
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x8038C008
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0xDFE35E0D
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x5ECCC9F9
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0x939B48E7
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0xF5E70D3F
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x9A8F71DA
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x6F7A5B6A
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0xF294D57B
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xA11A56A9
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x4AA69CB3
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0xE66EB44A
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x0D17F98F
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x1A7A60E3
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x8CB3A0F8
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0x6BE7F8E5

0x0F7B6850
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0xD6672DB2
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x87F1C657
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xEE4B3EAF

0x0F7B6850
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0xAECF24C4
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0xAD39E649
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xDE63F1F5
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0x0376608A
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x2F7AE37E
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0xBE2CD7C3
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xA5F6A0FB

0x0F7B6850
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0xE236C209
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x810CC664
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x57BE5863
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xC5EBD846
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x373489E2
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xFB5DE9E9
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x25D86667
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0xE9F9846E
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0xC08F8754
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0xEE57FBA1
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x4F970D01

0x0F7B6850
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0xFC2CFC23
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x4FA31446
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0x29EA8EA9
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x6E02082C
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xAB284DE1
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0x6A4F279F
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0xE858BEEA
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0x3AEE5BAA
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x13B268E1
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0x24A06963
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0xBB22FE6C
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x45518EFA

0x0F7B6850
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x1ACB1FE7
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x264E5AB3
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x435206F9
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0x92593EBD
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xA26865E0
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0xE236EB8C
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0xB54A0811
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xE3836C78
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x87643E6F
an indefinite future period.
0x55F6FD98

0x0F7B6850
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0x835A3918
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0x89C5A82B
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0x68FE4083
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0xC20BE46F
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x98165CAE
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x966DFB66
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xF728F492
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0xD5C374EA
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x2C513F71
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0xE362BD9C
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0xEFADD0BF
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0xE910969C
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0xEC7B78FC
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x71D9CB9D
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0x73F67424
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x73F8380F
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0x6A51FCD2
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0xB8FCADED
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0xA194CC51

0x0F7B6850
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xD8CD4B26
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0x7101378B
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x033CD474
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x3E57ECB5
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0x6C6A21FC
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xF615042A
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x816317C2
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x46ED0531
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x35EDC26B
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0xDFD59684
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0xFDFBFEDC
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x6115C0B9
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0xB55C9CE8
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0xB6280F90
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0xD747D96B
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x98A7ACE7
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0xFA25222B
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0xC0995C8F
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xB5ADA059
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0xD1739626
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0x863F265A
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x2877C3C9
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0xD0101FB5
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x431B9E4C
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xD72F0D8C
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0xB3D33036
house and gates.
0xA01F24A2

0x0F7B6850
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0xFBF2C12E
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0xD240AE06
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x8610EBAB
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0x9C51AE76
appeared at the door.
0x933C6094

0x0F7B6850
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x0E2A2A7D
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x679B8FF6

0x0F7B6850
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0xC4C00540
much.
0xB9496908

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x9256C028
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0x2167D2CD
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x27151F3B
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x0BBF0FB8

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x0DDC1146

0x0F7B6850
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0xCF7360CA
was called Rochester?"
0xD2513266

0x0F7B6850
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xD5ED1B32
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0xB11247F3
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0xCB7CA2C2

0x0F7B6850
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0xE2C37AB6

0x0F7B6850
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x45D41596
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x1523BA69
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x80FB0EDD
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0xBE58C9A7
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0xF1A4CAE2
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x1F6B1FA1
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x6131C10E
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0x7A778C58
expect nothing more."
0xB4F5F2E7

0x0F7B6850
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0xFEF65550

0x0F7B6850
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0xC9287BEB
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x7935D736
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x7D9CF3F5
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x0125DBAD
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0x10F888A7
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xF7D97B94
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x04A56BE2
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x97A028A3

0x0F7B6850
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x563051DA
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x0E55E7BF
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0x6044500B
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x1BF2A372
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0xB8C00077

0x0F7B6850
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x5CF75E47
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0xE0EFB7D6
approached.
0xDBB381A0

0x0F7B6850
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x553EC9D6
nurse; who answered--
0x1F9E8A88

0x0F7B6850
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x38523188

0x0F7B6850
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xA648F94E

0x0F7B6850
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x483E9372
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0x6CC122C5
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x474B6B95
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0xE0C710F0
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0xFFE29B7B

0x0F7B6850
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x3A93816E
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x3887AD08
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x4CB8DBD6
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x05E9716D
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x28871E69
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0xFB29E7B9
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x258559EA
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x6944F47E
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x85ECC12B
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0xD88BA77D
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0xEC8CD1B8
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0xE3DB881D

0x0F7B6850
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0xEE95260C
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x725052CB
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x337D1FF0
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0xEED17F00
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x5C815716
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0xA3C9450D
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x6B07894C
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0xD85327D0
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x5A2B705B

0x0F7B6850
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x33557949

0x0F7B6850
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x7282D6CD
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x73462E0B
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xB9255CA5
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0xDE752FA6
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0x6BCDB1B1
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xDEDF506D
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0xD20D500B
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0xD752407C
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0xBC59386C
fed with crumbs."
0x7E18DC7D

0x0F7B6850
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0xE889E1D9

0x0F7B6850
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x2C9C3D07
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x46F885F9

0x0F7B6850
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x0A9050F6
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0xA2A0C718

0x0F7B6850
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x9F162B84
clean town you spoke of?"
0x8CA7D3FA

0x0F7B6850
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xF1BD5E16
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0xF7FBB864
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x2B7A8B1C
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xF5AFE882
hear me sing now?"
0x17DD82D8

0x0F7B6850
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x47A4D172
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x933F3AD0
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0xDD637302
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0xBB8909CE
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x60008D3E
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x28FF53FC
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x7D1BB56B
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0xBDDA392E
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x030E3A02
affected her.
0x9F121F9F

0x0F7B6850
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0xB6018A2C
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0xE899425A
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x33F2526C
at least I thought so.
0x5750B69C

0x0F7B6850
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x7FE91259
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x05A7BFE0
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0x180FC17D

0x0F7B6850
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0x4E472BEF
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0xD73AA056
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x3E744499
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x88F7020F
carefully trained.
0x7668E778

0x0F7B6850
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0xFDDADDD6

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0x2B49D13A
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0xDEAE9C5F
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xE9B72BE8

0x0F7B6850
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x5310CC3B
say, with whom did you live then?"
0xBC63EBF6

0x0F7B6850
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0x1A6BBBFF
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0xC68EECCF
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x70B30D90
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0xB0CF77F2
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x590581AE
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0xD7A00CAE
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0xA7BA6F77
and I never see him."
0x4786D56E

0x0F7B6850
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xB0C6DCBA
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0xC7264B78
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x5A0126C4
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x647D26BD
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0x4888B3C2
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0xF70B6B9F
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0xDD8802AB
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x3EC60472
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x3DE27450
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x44CB6A3B
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x5AF68AAF
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0xA4B93ED7

0x0F7B6850
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x77CB6DFD
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x9C8A0941
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x3A570413
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0xD46ACD8F
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0xB9AE93C9
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0xFB493C45
use.
0x66A55A62

0x0F7B6850
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x36567A44
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xE3A15111
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0xB1689E4A
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x2F072A22
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0x126B0B74
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0xD8BE9772
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x172E81FC
sideboard.
0xF6150803

0x0F7B6850
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x89AEA264
before seen any half so imposing.
0x5266FAD8

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0xA22128E5
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0xFFDD1AD0
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0x3C9A8A37

0x0F7B6850
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x44CCEC80
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x7FDC7628
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x072B1BCC
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x0F3BCD63
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0xEE79EB12
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x8E07011A
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0x2632142E
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0x4014CD8A
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0xF94716ED
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x1BB1C969
general blending of snow and fire.
0x703F59FB

0x0F7B6850
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x2AC9E7C4
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x13BCA62A
were inhabited daily."
0xA0D3DE2B

0x0F7B6850
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x4E5A858E
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0xE24F27EB
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0xEEC7023D
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0x31B1B887

0x0F7B6850
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x7BA8DFF5

0x0F7B6850
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0xCE7D3CC1
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0xD9B41F15

0x0F7B6850
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x3E4C7A37

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x8BCA668D
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x3E5841A4
Rochesters time out of mind."
0xDDAB214B

0x0F7B6850
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xF86D20C6
liked for himself?"
0x6802DBA4

0x0F7B6850
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x9C120F3E
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x1570CD18
lived much amongst them."
0x51A48327

0x0F7B6850
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x2426CDE9

0x0F7B6850
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x158A52E9
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0xFA08579A
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0xD7840FFD
conversation with him."
0x3DF40A1E

0x0F7B6850
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x0B836CBC

0x0F7B6850
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0x67A9889B
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x07FB6838
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x07FB4F7C
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0xC1D5CC25
he is a very good master."
0xB99A313C

0x0F7B6850
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0xF4CD0F57
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x23D1C241
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x9AB4175E
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x685CA2D6
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x3F2DF795
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x9BEA5AFA
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x2CE5083A
definite notion of his identity.
0xF167CB94

0x0F7B6850
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0xAE2EA3FB
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x7C82BF19
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0x68A95C67
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x608F6C0C
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x554E9794
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x38387662
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0xFEAC06FD
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0xBF10DE05
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x2B4753BE
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0xD55CA1AD
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0x2E7ECE38
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0x93B60297
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x63FD3AA0
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0xB9BC9F88
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0xB5DCEB4D
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x41AD8D1F
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x62366290
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x88606154
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x373F3A79
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x3306ECE1
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0x4B49121C

0x0F7B6850
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x7C2AF3E0

0x0F7B6850
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x88565701
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x371C0CE5
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x900778C6

0x0F7B6850
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x3DA3B504

0x0F7B6850
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0xD94A880E

0x0F7B6850
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x544676B6

0x0F7B6850
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0x0F6C11B7
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xFF80A143
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xE32A7F9C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x3044D105
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0xA03D70FB

0x0F7B6850
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x19C0A251
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x9450266F
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0xDE2D4E5A
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0xDF45921C
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0xEFB47E97
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0xE08885A0
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x33323E44
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x721C270F
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0xFC172574
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x920A6EDF
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x433CA230
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x5D420B17
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x78610CB8
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0xE06A46AD
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x8C4204A0
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x47BFE1B0
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0xFC20E037

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x95863C2D
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x6CCADD3D
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0x47297549
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x1774AEB0
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x71B8DBA2
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x0B66A446
Bluebeard's castle.
0x9BA6EB39

0x0F7B6850
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0xA7CF74F1
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x8525F1AF
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x726F0218
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x405DA290
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x6CDCCF29
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0xF19671FD
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x8B00EF61

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0xC3406D2A
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0xA2468FBB

0x0F7B6850
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0xAF754DA4

0x0F7B6850
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xB05FF118

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x15DD39CE
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0xA8C692FF

0x0F7B6850
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0xE15B6071
odd murmur.
0x0BA3C2AC

0x0F7B6850
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x36989578

0x0F7B6850
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0x0971FB6E
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x8FC9BC43
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x85576A08
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0x2535858C
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xEF956D97
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0xCC3E062C

0x0F7B6850
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0x64E58223
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x8D8770B6
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0x2296B028
be conceived.
0xD2105182

0x0F7B6850
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xAD2E73BB
curtseyed silently and went in.
0x3F1BC467

0x0F7B6850
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0xBA2F0AF2
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0xDED2822D
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0xA715A2A6
pupil this morning?"
0x144D8F6D

0x0F7B6850
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0xC1A87A24
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0xEA7643D0
hall, exclaiming--
0x59CCE50A

0x0F7B6850
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x05828C11

0x0F7B6850
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
0x7DB1D6AA

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XII
0xED137155

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x87468A92
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x8139E91F
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x5516518D
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x2E984399
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0xDC4264F9
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0x8E1C67C2
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x27E858DA
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x98E2D50B
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0x873E1836
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x65D19DE2
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xCEB9383A
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0xF3A91F97
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x13E578DD
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x405BCD73
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0xCF132866
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x3035D6F8

0x0F7B6850
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x8836CB72
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0xD1455A7D
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0xEA37DA32
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x207BEF4E
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xB2DE9B9B
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0xEBB71CD3
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x56FD0A72
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x0EB8DBD3
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x4F6656E1
of her mind and character.
0xEB82054A

0x0F7B6850
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x3155447B
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0xDC3A9FBB
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x4C7A522C
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x3582993A
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xAAF3FCCE
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x8C4B7EF2
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0xFD045879
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0xB89CB62B
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x7ACCB70E
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0x4B88650F
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x1C649BE5
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0xB8BA28FE
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x0014A793
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0xF3444D19

0x0F7B6850
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x204B8960
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x1B737C72
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x8802A79C
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x921E0BA6
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0xF8E5289C
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0xDB4AD341
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x5BFA83DB
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x06465966
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0xAFBC572D
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0x0FB4B8E2
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x7B791D77

0x0F7B6850
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0xA576CF6D
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x80960FD3
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x16AC6762
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x1B3A375E
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x3AA54E60
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x67D1226B
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x3601643E
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x035A1C46
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xD04A7248
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x687B66F5
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x4FDC33A4
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x51F3F6B6
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x874A6E36
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x9ACAD8A7

0x0F7B6850
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x795D0ADA
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x5D5DB654
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0xCA32A472
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0x85DF8CD5
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0x7A125350
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x9DF517C9
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0xD0774DA6
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0x79E65B0D
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0x14698A19
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x79587794
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x94E59D2B
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xD2A5BC66
every effort of that sort.
0x65AAC6FA

0x0F7B6850
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x1892A1C0
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0xC4988862
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x8E84BB92
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0xDA3374D1
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xA8E6FA4D
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0xA6800DCE

0x0F7B6850
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0xA736A69B
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x08F2B847
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0xF52EC2E3
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x882BCC91
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x71186DB5
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0xC8A8F881
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x3FB57F93
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0xC0EC70FD
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0x96BBA535
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x4F12C143
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0x7086F3C1
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x0C0B19BD
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0xC09E2263
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x5D546EE0
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0xAD5EFE53

0x0F7B6850
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0xA536947A
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xFFD52D9B
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x79613196
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x8A00C57A
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x58AF8CE7
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0xE6C2C1C0
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0xAB12BF26
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xBFB69DA6
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xDCB9D85E
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x480BEE3A
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0xCA4F2FC1
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x6B56CA5C
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x60AB42B7
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0xED2A99E6
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x52C44612

0x0F7B6850
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x73AAD8DA
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xE4DB8EEA
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x52B05A41
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0xB605AD38
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0xD99C6C85
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x07B49CEA
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0xACFE5768
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0xECF4DE06
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xF0D0C520
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x0D2213AF

0x0F7B6850
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0xE720BA86
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0xC099D688
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x3C5CDE93
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x64846D8D
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x62F9AD8A
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xB290D37C
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x23321270
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0xD8463362

0x0F7B6850
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x93B12D11
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0xAE634216
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x23318210
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x2910AD77
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0xE9983866
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x667219C0

0x0F7B6850
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x913B0917
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x661D3623
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xABE1BBAC
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x5A04F9ED
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xDE6BF4D6
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0xAEB92170
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xF2D09AE7
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x2B902B1F
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0x0C6A8098
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0x60CE07E4
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xFF80A91A
me.
0x7F08C9A4

0x0F7B6850
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x0327C54F
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x34216C3B
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x057D1B7D
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x05E132C2
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0xB446C241
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0xDC177356
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0xF3AD8C54
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0x3BC5F0D8
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x8FFA34B3
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0x0EEC3B9B
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x23A985D2
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0xEF015A31
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x485E8168
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0x95EE2393
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x3811C766
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x4175DDF6
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0xF9B94B01
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0xED79545A
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x6A82B3AB
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x920148DA
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x4B7AD181
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0xD94734A7
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x38B1889A

0x0F7B6850
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x2EAE45BF

0x0F7B6850
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x33F7DF6B
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xD6998C99

0x0F7B6850
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x65BAB73C

0x0F7B6850
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x45861905
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0x00FC6BCD
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xB3D8C367
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x68F3D396
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x2453950D
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x3F50F113
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x89FDC678
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x4252AAE5
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x76B8ADED

0x0F7B6850
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x9D6B5D53
now drew near him again.
0xF67154B6

0x0F7B6850
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0x1C989C58
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xB9D82512

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0x7750F20F
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x563B7ABC
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xC483A569

0x0F7B6850
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0xD6FA1E26
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xE3D8C2E1
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x99819A76
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0xE05FDF72
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0xBE6EA178
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x7D07D54C
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x03538FCA
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x3067DC6C
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0x0D3670EC
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x49EBA28C
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x6B712662
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0x3403A582
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x679E36B2
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x14DAE735
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0xD0FD573C
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0x7FD43FD9

0x0F7B6850
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x5776EB95
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0xD607407B
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x1D329FF8
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0xEEED1D47
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x540D5B2E

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0x1956B9EC
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0xAD7CFBD0

0x0F7B6850
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x1DBBABC1
direction before.
0xFBF43034

0x0F7B6850
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x99FF0A2F
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x1BA40039

0x0F7B6850
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x1D314F4A
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0x51485EDF
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0xF04A1B50

0x0F7B6850
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x8AC9772B
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x52D8B86D
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0xB72B4FBC
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0x7F7B2856

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Whose house is it?"
0xE774D33E

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x28FAEA03

0x0F7B6850
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0x671896E8

0x0F7B6850
"No, I have never seen him."
0xEDFB9D0B

0x0F7B6850
"He is not resident, then?"
0x4415BF84

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x27C38B03

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot."
0xF8E2ECB3

0x0F7B6850
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0xC955E736
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x0969E7D0
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x29B599E9
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x2B4BD830

0x0F7B6850
"I am the governess."
0x866E8F7F

0x0F7B6850
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x177A9E6C
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x2A391DDF
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x6202BEFC

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x02BA528E
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0xDDFE94FC

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0xF5A5EE21

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0xB8B3FAA9
afraid?"
0x4B44A589

0x0F7B6850
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0xECADBA80
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0xF594F3E0
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xAE166B0F
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x04F70B08
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x0EA39EDE
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0x27B48975
he laughed.
0x50D42512

0x0F7B6850
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0x35D07995

0x0F7B6850
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0x38319B29
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x5E5745B5
come here."
0xE0BFC229

0x0F7B6850
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x6C0F6852
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0x4FD15BA4
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0xA97378E1
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0x46DBAA04
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0xA7F11401

0x0F7B6850
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x36F8EA6C
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x7E680B48

0x0F7B6850
I sought it and found it.
0x804BF13B

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0xD058EF31
you can."
0xFEBF55CB

0x0F7B6850
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x406FE2DD
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xFA578167

0x0F7B6850
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0xE3E3F61C
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xDF54E38C

0x0F7B6850
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0xF09D2659
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x957B12D9
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x7B72FE65
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0x92701832
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xB0E04ED6
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x6E6F14EC
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0xCD5AB20A
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x4B7A5474
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x6ED92C34
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x488C4EAC
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x3B92550C
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0xEABF688E
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x4EFDA09F
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x8F1623F2
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x698E6E11
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x06B58490
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x963D7768
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x0B2D4FF2
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0x39D46071
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xE4E4E0E6

0x0F7B6850
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x6690C720
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xB730A6F7
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xC49556EE
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x1FA1B8B4
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x2431E617
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0xFD18AE56
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xBD98614E
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0xB2B7A8A4
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x3479F9DE
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x731BE8D4
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x1BE1D56D
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x2AE11DFB
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x5AB17D8D
as it would be under his.
0xB02B0BD6

0x0F7B6850
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0x7B09F8B8
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x192C959E
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0xC59A9154
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x70132EB0
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x7E2056F8
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0x7A295A2C
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0xA28B9F08
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xBF1EA8E0
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xC314F681
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xF9EE26D2
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x7E2692FF
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0x8D79C5AD
door, and went in.
0xC9703514

0x0F7B6850
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0xFC41E915
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0xB9D1DE3A
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x31481E63
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0xF100B11F
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x8B75B843
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x1427C675
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x4C0D591A
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x80AC0157
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x0F415A81

0x0F7B6850
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x1E0DA889
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x9E6F6ABF
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x5BB579D2
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0xC7EC6581
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x27FA48B3
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0xC83A196A
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x02856FCC
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0xC6DA72E2
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x960E3DA6

0x0F7B6850
"What dog is this?"
0x47863BA7

0x0F7B6850
"He came with master."
0xAFF97B8A

0x0F7B6850
"With whom?"
0x852B2759

0x0F7B6850
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x48AE1648

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0x2E412006

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x8050635D
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x86301B1B
sprained."
0x726AAF1E

0x0F7B6850
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0xFAF2097F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x4817FFBC

0x0F7B6850
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0x4868BC92

0x0F7B6850
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0x49D77C31
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x34058D04
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x74C3525A
upstairs to take off my things.
0xD3F84B7D

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XIII
0x3D191657

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0xA37066C3
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x09FC43E2
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0x2B3154A4
and waiting to speak with him.
0xB5D318AD

0x0F7B6850
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x95181B50
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0xAE933510
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xCD8DAECB
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x334008A0
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0x040A5691
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x37787170
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0x9B92E585
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x1E639679
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x8E5094B3

0x0F7B6850
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x8B841AA0
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x49006B4B
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0xD19F0B20
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0xA4DCA40D
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0x57C94C4F
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x3A08AB15
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0xE6B35F88
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x9F219E44
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x9506B541
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x6B4C7C15
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x2C1EE0D2

0x0F7B6850
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0xF3B831C4
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x5E4D80E3
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0xD53BB3CA
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x6AC8096B
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x56ED13EA

0x0F7B6850
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xB4E7393C
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x3320BABC
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x9D4FB24A
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x856969B0
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0xCD912AB9
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x129DAB35
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0xFC2CAB29
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0x8E8E84A1
fireside.
0x4F2305D7

0x0F7B6850
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x013CD852
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x61E6B7C4
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x46654704
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0xAA581822
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x065876CA

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0x494EE37D
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x7212D32A
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x3CCFC62C

0x0F7B6850
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xAB8F2FD0

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0xC28C99E8
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0xC00101F5
candle."
0x61D9D56E

0x0F7B6850
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x8921C0F2

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0xB24EC097
is here."
0x747CC608

0x0F7B6850
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xFFB7A295
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0x20B3A957
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x6C6BC2C6
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0x5CCB0FCE
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0x434F7032

0x0F7B6850
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x14F12616
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0x6F1AB83C
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x34AB05C0
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xA83B2860
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0xA54DF051
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x3BF019B0
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x28832E3C

0x0F7B6850
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x2512C6DE
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0xD8210BAA
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x4606B0D8
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x7EAD3E0C
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x9C7AFB10
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0x6852B750
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x64F4ED9D
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x757352ED
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0xC0B6D22C
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0x970FA1FE
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x7B705003
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0xF63C5ED5
neither tall nor graceful.
0xCAB3BD60

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x08FD14DE
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0xC8A95DF6
lifted his head as we approached.
0x57C381F0

0x0F7B6850
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0xF467E65A
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0xC796721E

0x0F7B6850
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x7E84FA17
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x10E213D0
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x57872D20
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0x30145572

0x0F7B6850
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x8084F345
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0xD33B09A0
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x18E29D5F
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x8086D4D2
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0x32CFBAA9
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x84445A1A

0x0F7B6850
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0x32CE5D08
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x0239192C
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0xE4089BA2
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x85CBAE72
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0xE8D1E632
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x7E5E7456

0x0F7B6850
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x13F0D713
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x90715DFF
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0xD3EB5E64
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xF4EDE972

0x0F7B6850
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0xAF7DCCBC
might perhaps spill it."
0x42175394

0x0F7B6850
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x595E3999
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x8D5EE372

0x0F7B6850
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0xC92E3A93
votre petit coffre?"
0x2C5871CB

0x0F7B6850
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x6614B9B7
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x43B3CB60
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0x9901AA1A

0x0F7B6850
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x58CF660B
thought pleasant things."
0x5F5F5E5F

0x0F7B6850
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x78F7AC63

0x0F7B6850
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x937ADC09
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x4820172A
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xF12ED46A
nature."
0x61EC084B

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0xF286B1ED
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x4B6DE90E

0x0F7B6850
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x25D339D4
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0xBEE694E4
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x2DF85B34
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x4F4564C9
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x8C9E58E2

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x90A4E6ED
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xB20AA342
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0xD4140117

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x2DAAA07A
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x696D65B3

0x0F7B6850
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x1173F720

0x0F7B6850
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x0A183FD4
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0xEBEDE005
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x5058B898
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xFEC596C2
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0xF74F14D2
amuse herself with Pilot.
0xBACA9830

0x0F7B6850
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0x8EECC90E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And you came from--?"
0x806680A0

0x0F7B6850
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xBC8E9E38

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x17D25B83

0x0F7B6850
"Eight years."
0x009A4D30

0x0F7B6850
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x919D7BC5
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0xAEB1A4AE
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0x081E5DD8
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x8F6B9DEB
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x6205E48B
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0xD0E07262

0x0F7B6850
"I have none."
0xF2C21206

0x0F7B6850
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0xB424E493

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0xE6E71E46
that stile?"
0x7FE24B54

0x0F7B6850
"For whom, sir?"
0xCF0B7838

0x0F7B6850
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0xDB6183A0
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0xFFD8A2D8
causeway?"
0x46F7B97B

0x0F7B6850
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0x8159CDE0
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0xB7360A75
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0xAB81DABE
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0x86CF19AA
revels more."
0x874E3DF0

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0x0296BECA
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x9E71F647

0x0F7B6850
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x07E9E0A6
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x54222AD0

0x0F7B6850
"No; none that I ever saw."
0xFF217BF2

0x0F7B6850
"And your home?"
0xE95A22EC

0x0F7B6850
"I have none."
0xF2C21206

0x0F7B6850
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x9EFC2ABC

0x0F7B6850
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0xD387ADB7

0x0F7B6850
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0x77FDEE83

0x0F7B6850
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xD5766B1C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x77CDAA4F
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0xF22CB88C
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x1AF09758
Adele."
0x01BA00D8

0x0F7B6850
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x0C057D84
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x91E46D4D
felling my horse."
0x8D7F3394

0x0F7B6850
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x2103C375

0x0F7B6850
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0xE1C19B50

0x0F7B6850
The widow looked bewildered.
0xAE86AC8F

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0x5E137713

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir."
0x7A0AE7A7

0x0F7B6850
"Have you seen much society?"
0x8E8308D4

0x0F7B6850
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0x3275EDDE
Thornfield."
0x57586847

0x0F7B6850
"Have you read much?"
0x4D44DAEA

0x0F7B6850
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0x0095842F
very learned."
0xB45A3333

0x0F7B6850
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x6BD5C62E
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0xB1FA0464
parson, is he not?"
0x38D89C0A

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0xBC71F6AE
would worship their director."
0x9550CF13

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, no."
0x66809C57

0x0F7B6850
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x0CBA69A6
sounds blasphemous."
0x659ECC33

0x0F7B6850
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x39F6D9A9
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x1E955B14
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0x3277BE0C
hardly sew."
0xC8B54779

0x0F7B6850
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0xBB7B7DBB
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0xE2C0D950

0x0F7B6850
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0x56F03D4C
Rochester.
0xB2F8F0FC

0x0F7B6850
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0xAE5F55EE
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0xF8059A8C
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x90F176C0
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0xA559E685
to bed."
0x18E163A4

0x0F7B6850
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x7F5CB297

0x0F7B6850
"About ten."
0x33646391

0x0F7B6850
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0x2380354E

0x0F7B6850
I assented.
0xC1092A32

0x0F7B6850
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0xA6C14870
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x4DD900F4
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xE6328717
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0xA67F914C

0x0F7B6850
"A little."
0xE37E75C7

0x0F7B6850
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0xA97FD491
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0xAC4C39EF
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xB1686182
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x98BEC051
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0xB1BDE980

0x0F7B6850
I departed, obeying his directions.
0xBFACC3FF

0x0F7B6850
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x5C716108
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xA183DCF5
not well."
0xCDF60457

0x0F7B6850
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x85926101
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x15A184BE
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0xCD717C58

0x0F7B6850
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x6CFD20C0

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x87BBD9F6
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0xBBF3AC3D
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0xAB298E6D

0x0F7B6850
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0x5103C10D

0x0F7B6850
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x575B7B0E

0x0F7B6850
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x4B2054A4
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x94A54A9C

0x0F7B6850
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0xED00F7AC
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x77B0DBC4

0x0F7B6850
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x3AFB1DCD
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x944807EC

0x0F7B6850
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xFE96AE85
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x464C81D9
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x6E0EEDBC
hand yours?"
0x10FE805B

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0xBAB2C3E8
some thought."
0xBD9647EE

0x0F7B6850
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0x01334386
other occupation."
0xB91C9E23

0x0F7B6850
"Where did you get your copies?"
0xC1B27B4F

0x0F7B6850
"Out of my head."
0xD060663E

0x0F7B6850
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x3E37BD7A

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0x9C77AA94

0x0F7B6850
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0x8C59E1A1

0x0F7B6850
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0x3304633C

0x0F7B6850
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0x1EB29BD0
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xFB0D167E
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0x2BDFC274
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x1A90A64C
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x35E7AE2D
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0xC004C3F5

0x0F7B6850
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0xACB89626
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x0490D80A
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xAC79CE8B
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x09249DC4
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0xE60C338A
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0x7A102DF1
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0xAAB7537C
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0x71BBC9A8
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x010A94F6
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0xA104BF79

0x0F7B6850
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x6D20E031
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0xB77FFB86
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0x7A69A91C
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0xE750B130
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x967DC096
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0xF08A6043
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0x2A741E4A
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x6557064B
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x6D2679DB
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0xF9FB1C3E

0x0F7B6850
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0xA562172D
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x4AB528D1
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x5B71AC5C
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xEC5794BE
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xC50F697D
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x190523DC
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0xF15F4A23
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0xCF51F115
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x1DC3D7CE
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0xCB4DE0A7
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x79D1E260
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xEA918D78

0x0F7B6850
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0xA1BC7181
presently.
0x654031D1

0x0F7B6850
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0xE8C2BA7F
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x53D6745C

0x0F7B6850
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x7D68D1E8
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0xA8CDF26B
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x2A5EFED5
each day?"
0x6C0A28D4

0x0F7B6850
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0xE7824B3A
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0xE2EAB024
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0x92EEBC22

0x0F7B6850
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0xC26E217A

0x0F7B6850
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0xFB0AA98E
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x738EB7BA
powerless to realise."
0xD7B4338F

0x0F7B6850
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x9BF85018
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0xC5E567B9
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x7065EFD5
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x8B7B7440
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0xD7FDAF45
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x7C43C4E5
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0x69DF7BF5
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0xFACE6BBA
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0xFAEF491F

0x0F7B6850
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0xB44475BF
watch, he said abruptly--
0xD0A75AA4

0x0F7B6850
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x8FEF0AEA
so long?  Take her to bed."
0x3753113D

0x0F7B6850
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x05541923
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0x35FCBAE2
much.
0xB9496908

0x0F7B6850
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x1A40E181
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x0F19C901
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x07C6C8BE
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x95AF6031

0x0F7B6850
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x3820D99C
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x0CEED68C

0x0F7B6850
"Well, is he?"
0x958D36BA

0x0F7B6850
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x3B789785

0x0F7B6850
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xDDD2653A
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0x914E75BE
temper, allowance should be made."
0xC1551B8C

0x0F7B6850
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0x0F7B6850
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x0375B4AE
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0x381B40E8
make his spirits unequal."
0xCDA4C5C2

0x0F7B6850
"What about?"
0x971EFD47

0x0F7B6850
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xA338D60A

0x0F7B6850
"But he has no family."
0xF0C1288E

0x0F7B6850
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0xDA610D85
brother a few years since."
0x773E9AD2

0x0F7B6850
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x5ADA102F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x0CF81DD5
the property; only about nine years."
0x1C31CE34

0x0F7B6850
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xAA01DA3A
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0xA07097F3

0x0F7B6850
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x601A91C2
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x9E30C66C
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0xCE573912
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0xC0024D56
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x78FA6BFD
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x3BD58F4F
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x58A25438
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0xA18F85AB
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0xEA49BE98
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x7D2B420D
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0x920AEA33
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x19E6C7F1
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x216E8959
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0x165EAC8D
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0xCF9DE494
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0xCEAD675C

0x0F7B6850
"Why should he shun it?"
0x7BB86584

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0xF2535696

0x0F7B6850
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0xFD5DD8E4
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xAE79957B
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x4C38EB69
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x87798B1F
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x899EAD9E
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x5D99BB5F

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XIV
0x1472EB02

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xB6F946F4
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0x302A2B9B
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xFD6C5A38
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x219D5EBF
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x87E33527
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x064D28E1

0x0F7B6850
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x652EE1BB
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x99FCE22A
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x3855159C
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0xF8FCB00C
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x7A133BBE
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xFB4CC5F6
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x30E49F9E
causes quite disconnected with me.
0xF4C6CFA0

0x0F7B6850
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x344CF163
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0xC01804D2
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0x3F47BAE3
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0xD0F0BCC8
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0xC2281A26
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xBB8F2626
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x89C26CD5
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0x265FD314
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0xA6096451
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0xC557F3A6
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x17184A56
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0xE4999302
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0xDC9739EF

0x0F7B6850
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0xF8A191D0

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x7E2C235D
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0xD7CCF496
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x7709F181
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x44C58FC4
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x70C34A70
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x4C801FEE
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x59DDAAFD

0x0F7B6850
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0xF9C11E2B
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x8975ED22
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xFC2A26D7
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x4A9991D0

0x0F7B6850
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0x298BA89A
contemplation.
0x802D1825

0x0F7B6850
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0xC768F42F
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x7B817449

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x01446FBA
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x93271A9E
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xECC02A63
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x5D2B4F93
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x26D15D2A
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x04D1127B
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0xDA14F167
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x0A6CD96D
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x674352AA
said to be thicker than water."
0x24F76FA2

0x0F7B6850
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x9B5D62B1
knitting-basket in hand.
0xB14A5A45

0x0F7B6850
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x54D38D08
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0xDCE887F7
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xB95440A0
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xADA24B38
performed."
0xBC49E082

0x0F7B6850
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0xFA9866A9
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x76A14591
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x65F6C8C4
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x30152412

0x0F7B6850
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0xBEF93551
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0xD44C9830
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0xE0EED14A
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x3C8D51CF
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0x600BEEAA
mind to do."
0x25A044B9

0x0F7B6850
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x8337BA94
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0x7EA9D1E3
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0xB0EF2D9F

0x0F7B6850
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xD0CEC2AC
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0x21546C95
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x24222523
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x421DC381
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x70775A07
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xA04625DA

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x1DC3FFB0
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0xCEDC31D0
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x5DCBF6AB
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x283D52E0
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x0102FEA2
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x80010CAE
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xE27BC2F2
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0x87BC5B0F
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0xB5610C7C
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x6B443C4A
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0xB6294E46
feeling.
0x85E0F7C2

0x0F7B6850
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x05B34BFC
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x9ED21389
fastened on his physiognomy.
0x6CC13C03

0x0F7B6850
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x15BB2A56

0x0F7B6850
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0xBE2979B1
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x62BE95E1
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x6BBC8BDD

0x0F7B6850
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0xA1A5EAA2
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x792FAC00
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0xAEE066B8
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x461C3682
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x8700445B
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0xB70FFA61
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0x0A211BC4

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x8817C6FB
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x167A166F
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xB1D75B51
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xE77A91D1

0x0F7B6850
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x57D89E0B
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x7AE4A8C3
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x93412929
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0xE636AE83
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xB76873A2

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xD1F7DAD6
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x661B9320

0x0F7B6850
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x967BE64B
does my forehead not please you?"
0x6E086734

0x0F7B6850
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x3783B484
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x807DB2EA
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x23FF2E44

0x0F7B6850
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0xF910776B

0x0F7B6850
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0xBD6EB319
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x21556A10

0x0F7B6850
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x7C286D85
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0x44B0C6F6
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x40972950
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0xCB68BB9F
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0x7EB34120
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0xF24EC5AF
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xEA19550E
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x3EC5D625
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x5EBCB12A
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x9267E9E3
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0xAC9AEE17
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0xC0BF7E66
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x6CCCD7C4
me?"
0x18A87D50

0x0F7B6850
"Hope of what, sir?"
0xE9D55E46

0x0F7B6850
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0xBC3B6DE5

0x0F7B6850
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x68B91574
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0xFFC93666
capable of being re-transformed?
0x4D3A484A

0x0F7B6850
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x0D8EEFC6
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0xC5B8CA86
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xA4BDA62F
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0xBEA5FBB5
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x1185E46C
to-night."
0x212AA641

0x0F7B6850
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x636CD7E8
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0xBB8D17BD
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0xBD442F53
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x5C679651
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x552F0C2E
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0xBF2A5AB9
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x6201DE75
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x6850CACE
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x166B60C3
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x0A24F904
confidence.
0x0139C65B

0x0F7B6850
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x0459E8AA
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x04803F9A
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xF359DE04
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0xF52BEA2D
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x47B2D2C0
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0xB0AB8FA7
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x26CE0296
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0xC1E73B0D
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xEC28C18F
you--therefore speak."
0xA1BA7BB2

0x0F7B6850
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x667B0B31
smile either.
0x47FA5C87

0x0F7B6850
"Speak," he urged.
0xE8E5F6D8

0x0F7B6850
"What about, sir?"
0x771686DD

0x0F7B6850
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0x2E735212
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x492902B4

0x0F7B6850
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0xCFAA6344
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0x2298B561
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0x566AF6EE

0x0F7B6850
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0x3B2DEBF8

0x0F7B6850
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0x63AB040A
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x81065F27

0x0F7B6850
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0x286ABC53
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0xFCEA8970
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x82E1E083
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xFC1A80F1
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x3C97D12F
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xF0443602
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0xF3E3FA49
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0x6B0BFA89
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0xA0C55FB6
rusty nail."
0x1B4B1A09

0x0F7B6850
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x41CC5866
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0xF21E40CB

0x0F7B6850
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x40A1B774
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x9BFBDFF3
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x7D13AC86

0x0F7B6850
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x2E0645A0
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0xB0A40F41
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x878C34BD
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x06C90B01
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x31BFE134
people in one house?"
0x0B9C3803

0x0F7B6850
"Do as you please, sir."
0xE7AF0353

0x0F7B6850
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0xADD75C9D
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0xF6A89ADD

0x0F7B6850
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0x327A1F3B
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x824D2EBB
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0xDF3D4D3C
and experience."
0xB35E3E39

0x0F7B6850
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x7C5A3966
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x90256C22
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0xD8BD31CA
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x531D5F61
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xFF9F4F9E

0x0F7B6850
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0xAB9F4365
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0xD2B944D1

0x0F7B6850
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0x02F71C25
expression; "but speak too."
0xE07DF9C7

0x0F7B6850
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x264E0A0C
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xB8834701
their orders."
0xB6E6D457

0x0F7B6850
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0x5AF026F1
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0xE5DB2DEE
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x00EB5F1E

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x86E4C6ED
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xB785D1BB
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x84ACA355

0x0F7B6850
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0xAD1E1733
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0xA64D4213

0x0F7B6850
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xD58AC746
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x4C11E61D
salary."
0xBC596698

0x0F7B6850
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x1C8E4653
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0xFD0A3C68
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x45D49FB1
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0xFE14D435
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x79A8614C
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x01F46512
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x8E54C4D2
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xD083670B
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x63BA65EF
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0xBEAEF984
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x68D335A1
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0xE3F0AA58
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x6913C977
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0xFE8B77C8

0x0F7B6850
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0xADE0CBB6
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0xA5971E6C
as well as imagined--
0x1C538065

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0xF0BD8C1A
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x231536DD
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0xC7D9C8C5
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0xCABC5AC0
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0x331D8ABC
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0xD5149793
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0xBC09918A
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x401FF560
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x47BB10A3
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0xC7383D16
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x28EBC62D
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x216A6AFA
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0xF1F2032C

0x0F7B6850
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x91D298B6

0x0F7B6850
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x6D0D661D
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0xCB8FF6AE
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x1923A0A0
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0xEB9589A0
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xA29A41E7
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0x00A1E736
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x1AFE5540
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0xDFD5DF38
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0xB277C569
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xA46B3656
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0xB240EE7F
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0x156158F1
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x9BA31C33
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0x7F919206
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x540B3295
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0xBEE3D277
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0xDBA979C6
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0xC2FA1247

0x0F7B6850
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
0x00EE0615

0x0F7B6850
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
0x4C90B41E
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x27A69237
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x9ABAB411
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0xDDD24C0A
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0x398C27F0
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0xA11758BB
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
0xE858794D
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
0xC8FCC825
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
0x528C82FD

0x0F7B6850
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
0x4723800E

0x0F7B6850
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
0xFFC5E189
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0x550AD33E
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0xB6AF92E8
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
0xC4A10040
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
0xF7D00B37

0x0F7B6850
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
0xEA2636EC

0x0F7B6850
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
0x91C4CF0A
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
0xFF0F863A
moor."
0xF115A6F4

0x0F7B6850
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
0x35B3B122

0x0F7B6850
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
0x289191E2
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
0xB3209B08
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
0x3EC40F4D
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
0x1EF169B3
unacquainted with its mysteries."
0x0E175489

0x0F7B6850
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
0x79FB95B9
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
0x48F33400

0x0F7B6850
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x20AC9A5D
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0x46FBD83B
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x38BA43F6
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0x730F6378
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
0x6D1DD5C9
when it asks entrance to my heart."
0xCC7721C3

0x0F7B6850
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
0x67721CF5

0x0F7B6850
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
0xD5D81EB5
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
0xD5D989DB
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
0xBEFBCB33

0x0F7B6850
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
0x282BDDE4
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
0x875A1A0E
misery if you listen to it."
0x8ADA3883

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
0xDDBF7EE8
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
0xAEEC9941
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
0x412DE1B0

0x0F7B6850
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
0x6A8D67D2
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
0xD84C01B2
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
0xE5CDD1E1

0x0F7B6850
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
0x74049431
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
0x68449649
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
0x6D6261D6

0x0F7B6850
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
0xC4A2A8B5
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
0xC010C4F3
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0x349902FF
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0x9F84549E
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0x4E4B465E
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0xD6840FD1
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0xB2A88C09
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
0x5F05C5D4
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
0x23682AC0
which you might revert with pleasure."
0x4C904604

0x0F7B6850
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
0xD14904EE
paving hell with energy."
0x927584A9

0x0F7B6850
"Sir?"
0x522CD5EA

0x0F7B6850
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
0x10C32CBA
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
0x84A61FEA
been."
0xC42DFB7E

0x0F7B6850
"And better?"
0x870C0E3F

0x0F7B6850
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
0x51F0091F
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
0x6165D6C8
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
0xED8C8FA0
and Persians, that both are right."
0x3D8564FE

0x0F7B6850
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
0xCB0B8749

0x0F7B6850
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
0x709DFD05
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
0x57522CC1

0x0F7B6850
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
0x18A5F043
is liable to abuse."
0xDB349625

0x0F7B6850
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
0xCDCA37E2
abuse it."
0xAA9FC569

0x0F7B6850
"You are human and fallible."
0x2A6A4955

0x0F7B6850
"I am: so are you--what then?"
0xA5737CA8

0x0F7B6850
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
0x3AFE45D1
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
0xAE80ABFC

0x0F7B6850
"What power?"
0xC446F801

0x0F7B6850
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
0x92D949A7
right.'"
0x4F314B36

0x0F7B6850
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
0xEBE72740

0x0F7B6850
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
0x689F5E44
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
0x8ADAC4A1
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
0x328542F2
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
0xEC9A3471
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
0x15E88E77

0x0F7B6850
"Where are you going?"
0x9C21E4C3

0x0F7B6850
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
0xD8AD4DEA

0x0F7B6850
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
0xE5C432CC

0x0F7B6850
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
0xD2AF5F44
certainly not afraid."
0x68FA9635

0x0F7B6850
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
0x9CED71BF

0x0F7B6850
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
0xEB3805CA

0x0F7B6850
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
0xE213630A
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
0x3D834C94
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
0x9BA556E2
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
0xF4CB0BA8
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0xB1988334
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0xB5BD3E1F
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0x6D2DB941
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
0x88B5E8A0
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
0x97DE7EF1
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
0xFE61F329
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
0xE4625B25
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
0xCBFD57E4
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
0x9E6AD4A9
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
0x3098C8E3

0x0F7B6850
"It has struck nine, sir."
0x40DAACBB

0x0F7B6850
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
0x431C4CED
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
0x109CD7D3
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
0x161FEB9B
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
0x5FA5C7AD
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
0x28716D93
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
0x422353FD
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
0x5DB41805
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
0xFAE7D2B1
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
0x0DB22B62
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x8A027648
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0xF3DED809
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
0xE54AD8B8
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
0xE30EDC79
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
0xE61A03EC
will be realised."
0x86037653

0x0F7B6850
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
0x65854139
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0x2C82AA4E
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0x98D632EB
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0x82DFF8DB
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0x61EF1F83
and small white satin sandals.
0xE2B14684

0x0F7B6850
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
0x989DDB23
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0x873C0311

0x0F7B6850
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0xACB89F51
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0x6C861FC2
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0xC71A919B

0x0F7B6850
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x41B5E39D
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0x2AB724AC

0x0F7B6850
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0xDDA9AB3A
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0xBD433BCA
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x903EB5DF
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x93D6449E
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0xB792C67F
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0xA197CBE5
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0xBD95A0DC
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xB4C97285
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0x1D48ECA1
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x1ADBFC47
Good-night."
0xA7451124

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XV
0x3A52BBAA

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x55998593
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0x10CE39D4
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0x28D87E2C
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0xA58ED772

0x0F7B6850
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0xB45DFC52
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0xF6D674A1
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x790913B1
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0xCDC25CB8
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x9A9168B8
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x714481B4

0x0F7B6850
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0xAC6831E0
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x948C574B
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0x0325BA2E
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0xF4FA3381
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0xE41F4C2C
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x5176FAA9
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0xFF5E9732
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0x6E6BBD0A
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0x5D70A72F
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0xD55F14F8
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x8B2AF6AF
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x2C182C9E
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x91F5C6AB
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0x8772EF35
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x7746B44D
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0xC58A51CB
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0xF3C32F19
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0x4B2D0EC1
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x71694CD1
now, if you will excuse me."
0x3D268A3E

0x0F7B6850
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x4AF95E3B
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x0C526DEC
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x04E39131

0x0F7B6850
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x3365F67E
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0xBA96AE6E
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0x7CD47E9E
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x71E9E789
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xEB9A7EFD
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0x766F41FC
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x5EEDEC26
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xBD396CAB
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0x51463362
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0xBCA8876B
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x05C1423E
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0xD0DF811F
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x5D733656
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x36727DBB
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x4046B965
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0x8FF1F09B
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0xD6488913
cochere_ of the hotel.
0xA94831E5

0x0F7B6850
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x6CDC2CA3
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0xA0B70C90
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xFDA18D36
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x4952335B
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0x8CA1AA64
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0xFF27DB1B
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x0AE468B8
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0xAC1236D6
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0xF1FBA219
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0x943EE114
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x17804A63
current--as I am now.
0x971154BF

0x0F7B6850
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0xD3E426D7
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xE5B3B664
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0x002898F5
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x0EE0C1D3
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x2B4F96D4
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xABC96675

0x0F7B6850
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x16D78CB4
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0xB8FA2F9D
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0xC57F12ED

0x0F7B6850
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x1879F10D
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x853D6580
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x264A5012
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x13CA9C81
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x7C17895D
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x944229C6
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xAE733BA2
his countenance: he went on--
0xC250B7CB

0x0F7B6850
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0xE8F20F02
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x2609C2B2
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x18655D7F
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x5AC59EAC
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0xA563172A
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x7EFF5EBE
if you dare!'
0xF975B912

0x0F7B6850
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x2C1DAD4D
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0xE03889AD
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x333699CD
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0xE390D743
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xA500B020
but straw and rotten wood."
0xF16FB3C0

0x0F7B6850
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x1034CCE5
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0xCB18844C
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0xFE27D5AA
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0xC7EA362A

0x0F7B6850
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x54FB2DAC

0x0F7B6850
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x9A79D710
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x1D6B3715
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xDBAEABAD
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0x2A1DFDBB
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0x2AF41566
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x3AD1CF00
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0x49DD2B88
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x1488EDD9
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0xC5DFA7E9
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xC003B181
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x523233E4
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x758C34D9
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x0428DA22
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xEB912149
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x8CB251E4
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0xF961681E
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0xAD199BA0
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0xFCA2F256
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0xE5522DE0
After this digression he proceeded--
0xA8817501

0x0F7B6850
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x0CFB579C
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x82E9EB2B
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0x61C27414
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x8BE9011E
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0xFB7DF175
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x6CE59DE4
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0xB8CC3782
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0x302752F1
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0xFADC5563
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0xB8B06416
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x46926B7E
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0x65ACC8C4
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x7AB4A4E2
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0x0EDA951C
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x91D390A5
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x2251CC5E
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0xA012D546
who had been her dupe.
0x3A4CEB70

0x0F7B6850
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xB1D05A69
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x9EFAFDFD
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x3F49D8E4
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x2F0864E9
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0x29732295
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xD0E8847F
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x65CBA4AC
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0xA740ABFE
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x2837A045
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x25F06EAB
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0xAAFC8306

0x0F7B6850
Adele here came running up again.

0x0F7B6850
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0xF79CC08F
wishes to see you."
0xC2828E0D

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x22C91BC5
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0xA88B4597
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x2AE010E0
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0x104B97F5
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0x52B2931B
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x8FBF5AD1
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x68FDCAE9
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0x6878179F
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x6EF24DAA
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0x4144E02C
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0x58824B2F
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x8E6AF6E0
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0xCD364EBB
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x644F3A88
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x7EC9EE07
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0xEB8068C0
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0xB03A69AE
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0x6ACA11D4
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0x56DE2BA3
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0xBB5AE6FE
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0xAB5B6811
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x59DA6E32

0x0F7B6850
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0xB27D61D3
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xAA5F986C
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0xFB60890F
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0xA930F85F
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x78A4BABE
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x51D5C6D8

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0xEDE26651
you too: it darkens."
0xCF0D3F80

0x0F7B6850
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0x2DF1BF38
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x8719B4F1
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x89A6CCA5
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x3C059DBC
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0x27DC0518
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x54A5F205
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0xDE7A7E1A
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0xE23FC7EE
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0xAB692581
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0x2B4CB529
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x961AC18C
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0xABB4BB04

0x0F7B6850
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x961BA32F
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x209F0109
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x12020EF0
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x93506524
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0xA5B40D47
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x80B7E5C1
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x37FF1A98
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0xBB8A5F9D
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x87F00C98
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x2762EFED
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0xB06CD63C
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x38427E4A
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xEE2A02A3
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x3DD189E8
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0xB873A526
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0xD6ECC1D3
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x0A4A74F0
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0xB9E38359
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x2C4D78AA
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0xA2B2985D
benefit.
0xAA2BEDB3

0x0F7B6850
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0xA3B3A3D4
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0xE029B24C
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x573CF267
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0xEB40E8E5
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x0A9FAC6F
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xE5B4F485
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x852FD2CE
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x07F65D69
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0x2B96471A

0x0F7B6850
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x6291AAA8
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x262AF9FF
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x364CD3DA
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0x555AC90A
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0xCE8964B7
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x0AF707C2
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xAED499BE
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x0CBEFF0D

0x0F7B6850
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x758743A7
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0xC6754B75
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0x3FA585E4
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0xCD166140
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xE69FA028
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x87DE530C
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xE29E28A8
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0xD5D8B9AC
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0xAA269890
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0xFE4EE18F
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0xD0393D76
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x825D8E6D
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0x165B7C4F
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0xF6F2F87A
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0xDA227B99
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xF5AEB48B
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x06DF07CA
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x759FBB55
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x15C42ED8

0x0F7B6850
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0x7DCD0E10
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0x51B01F78
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0xB839DABB
Thornfield.
0xB086A0F2

0x0F7B6850
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0xCAB99844
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x87308AEE
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x36AC29F7
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0xD9D4846C
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0xECDDF2B7

0x0F7B6850
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x1FC349E9
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x961887B7
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0x55C36FFA
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x585C7695
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x130CA58A

0x0F7B6850
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x11F61010
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0xF6457672
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x63DE8292
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0xF0244BA0
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x24A120CC

0x0F7B6850
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0x118D8ABF
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x8D3F2986
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x47727308
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0xF5AFD40D
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xB169A0CF
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0xD6B5A8CF
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xB640231A
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x225053F0
enough.
0x7C56E388

0x0F7B6850
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0xB2C3989E
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x10E8E839
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x6F7EBA5A
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0xC7955BF9
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x02BA2A23
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xF9E3C67A
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0xA03F4E80
there?"
0x35BE3284

0x0F7B6850
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x047C770A
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x93130F05
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x8E782AAD

0x0F7B6850
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0xEC692307
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0xCE8152BD
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0x9F232285
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x355F3814
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x560DC10E
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0x6366C5E0
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xDD514E3B
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0xDF46AE3C
burning.
0xDB37FB8B

0x0F7B6850
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x5570442E
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0xEF625F4A
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x89759E42
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0xEEBDFF72
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0xE17AFA2C
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0xCD76025D

0x0F7B6850
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x08FBD9C2
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x193008E7
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0x011B1EAA
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x66242675
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x97372429
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x6DAF06DB
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x90167205

0x0F7B6850
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x2FE19938
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xAA21A1E4
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0xBFD1EA75
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0x53963CB8
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xB91B4AFE
water.
0x1BF7EB05

0x0F7B6850
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x617EC735

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x091BC213
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0xA08AE831

0x0F7B6850
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x9FA850D4
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x632302EC
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0xEDE9248E

0x0F7B6850
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x9864E24C
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0xD839A88D

0x0F7B6850
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0xDE5FE8BB
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x3E4E54BF
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x110DC780

0x0F7B6850
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0xC39363D9
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x63E2D256
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xD5DB138B

0x0F7B6850
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x84E16D2E
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0x72F9BC45
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x5A4B8457
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x65D4579A
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xDF3F8257

0x0F7B6850
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xDBF96917

0x0F7B6850
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0xC94800FF
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0xAF8E744F

0x0F7B6850
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0xDA9ADF4B

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0x95A90440
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0xBE32022B

0x0F7B6850
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0x421E5613

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xECE3F392
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x803EB381
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x19E5AF6A
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0x8A332EA7
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x4C307C63
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x7A90FE42
move, remember, or call any one."
0x5E06D665

0x0F7B6850
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0x4BE36FFB
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x71D67B9C
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xFF3DC4BC
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0x4D29F58C
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0xA665CE9C
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0x0AFBA748
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xBA22CE4B
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x937D5C5B
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x12119811
"and not something worse."
0x04C99BD5

0x0F7B6850
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x9CAEC839
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0xD2633AF5

0x0F7B6850
"How, sir?"
0xC34DDC4C

0x0F7B6850
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x0CF67513
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0x4D9BDB5C

0x0F7B6850
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xB900A4DB
door."
0xDC15C486

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0xC7CC075A

0x0F7B6850
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xBA71AD21
think, or something like it?"
0xA196A64E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x404BE2D2
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0xE9F06EFD

0x0F7B6850
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x10150A47
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0x36D9BA55
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x97086A5D
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x97F113C3
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0xC39E4423
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0xC2CA48DA
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0xA656C875
hours the servants will be up."
0x05C03A79

0x0F7B6850
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x6E653C35

0x0F7B6850
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xB51CEE8C
go.
0x53120F4F

0x0F7B6850
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0x5E9792AB

0x0F7B6850
"You said I might go, sir."
0xCAD539E8

0x0F7B6850
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x5EC0AA9B
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x0C675A6C
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xC7327501
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xD020A50E
At least shake hands."
0xDA2014F8

0x0F7B6850
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xEB7DEB4C
both his own.
0xD6F222D0

0x0F7B6850
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x71F23290
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0xCFBD72BD
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x20B28A05
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x9DFD1D6C

0x0F7B6850
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x894F65E6
his voice was checked.
0x16A423FA

0x0F7B6850
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0x09A03ADB
in the case."
0xC08B64E3

0x0F7B6850
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xB46D9C5C
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0xEEF076CF
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0x3F703221
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0x7AA2CDBF
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x53F71DDF
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"

0x0F7B6850
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0xB65C1232

0x0F7B6850
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x2CF78F5C

0x0F7B6850
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x86617CAB

0x0F7B6850
"I am cold, sir."
0xD0451974

0x0F7B6850
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0xC05DD8F0
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0xE3CBB690
expedient.
0x50C13475

0x0F7B6850
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x9E7667BE

0x0F7B6850
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0xB4E7D630

0x0F7B6850
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0xEE77439C
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x77A284C6
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xFDA52CC1
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0xE6F6DE68
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xE975FA08
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0xE0EBE3C3
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0xA1FC212F
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x48933BD9

CHAPTER XVI
0xF4079E40

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0xF1EA135A
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0x03D15824
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x918BCCD7
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0xDCE3FDA7
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xF8AA1C4A
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0xEF55802C

0x0F7B6850
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x0EE3ED3B
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xA8973111
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x90F5F947
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0xE8A06A93
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0x3323F293
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x02716E9D
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xAD08189B
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xE5E4A465
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0xAF6837A1

0x0F7B6850
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0x6D0F6777
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0xE7FDEFB1
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0xB5DD77DE
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x9BFAC894
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x9E8F1F24
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0xDDEC3FE5
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0x12CEB505
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x0BADF985
no other than Grace Poole.
0xE8FAB255

0x0F7B6850
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0xE7722D60
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x1A199F5D
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0xE43E5D66
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0x286EEDA6
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x6723B45F
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0xB4F09661
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0xD621DC25
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x7029DFFB
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0xB21AF55F
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0xA540AE98
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0xA2D1BC11
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0xBC960D59
went on with her sewing.
0x07C9442C

0x0F7B6850
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0x1B683111
is past comprehension."
0x1C5F66F1

0x0F7B6850
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x56DA6B02
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x6233C7B4

0x0F7B6850
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x3A24BE0D
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xDCA7FDBE
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0x8F0FF38A
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0xEE2D91A4

0x0F7B6850
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x3048D6DE
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x588BA49F

0x0F7B6850
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0xBB806AD2
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x4F5FB679
she answered--
0x29630357

0x0F7B6850
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x94A72356
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0x2863F19A
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x1E435C4B
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0xAE1CD6B7
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0xA48E8441
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x3B8432EF
a noise?"
0xD0D78B89

0x0F7B6850
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x124E0A1D
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0x196EB156
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0x5355F819

0x0F7B6850
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x36C17283
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x749CE568

0x0F7B6850
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0xF24D73C7
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x54FF9A95

0x0F7B6850
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x916D40C3
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x9E1A8B9B
conscious eye.
0x62F6ED00

0x0F7B6850
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xDC222843

0x0F7B6850
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0x013D9A16

0x0F7B6850
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0xF9C268C0
gallery?" she further asked.
0x210693E6

0x0F7B6850
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x3F6E5A6C
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0xF2A14A90
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x685B4208
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0xF6EE6B87

0x0F7B6850
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x0B5AAFD3

0x0F7B6850
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x65C9CC06
you get into bed?"
0x348EDF4D

0x0F7B6850
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0xBCD74145
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x3E496BD8
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0xF2054987
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0xFE495623
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x2B67E0F2
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0xE40E6236
lie down."
0x5CFD18D3

0x0F7B6850
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0xA7BAB07D
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0x0CCDDE7F
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0x09F8E2C7
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0xCA0744C7
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x9FF32750
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0xD8B123E5
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x8341CA01
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0xDFEABBCC
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0xD170A422
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xFA882CDE
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0xE485784B
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0xA0D44A19
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x96DC9429

0x0F7B6850
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x2CBFF05A
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0xFC44A72E
entered.
0xD48C1EFD

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x31BF82F6
be ready: will you come down?"
0x44B1379D

0x0F7B6850
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0xFD3DE815
carry it upstairs."
0xFCB5121B

0x0F7B6850
"You'll have some meat?"
0x503DAC7A

0x0F7B6850
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x4B22E635

0x0F7B6850
"And the sago?"
0xB50E5212

0x0F7B6850
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0xD790ADE4
make it myself."
0x6053AA9E

0x0F7B6850
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x0DDA92A3
so I departed.
0xF64EA913

0x0F7B6850
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x9623F878
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x87E86508
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x345FF1D7
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0xAFCD9435
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x5107C4B9
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xA1D6997C
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x7CBAF90E
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x1FADF19D
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0xFC6B302A
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0x398D1843
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x310604F8
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x4CCC55DF

0x0F7B6850
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0xF7C7FBD4
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0xEC0FC7D6
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xA7376799
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x59F819A3
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0x385DEF06
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0xEE220DE8
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0xC5AC6BD3
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xFC35DCD3
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x61971234
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0xFB65C1A5
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xDC7F5786
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0x3AB62FAF
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0x20A2CFE5
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0xE7A5C942
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0xA7C86B88
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x96175749
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x8BAD4741
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x5A20E3AB
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x875A7DBF
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xCF6FBC38

0x0F7B6850
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x0F12BBE1
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0xD48BB6CB
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0xFFA0364D

0x0F7B6850
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0xBFFE7F8D
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xA4662022

0x0F7B6850
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xB3B2446F
thinking.
0x4D307134

0x0F7B6850
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x9CECBC7F
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0x8028BDE6
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x31931CCB
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xA46E820A
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x30E4831A
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0xCC994FEC

0x0F7B6850
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0x9386E4E1
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x68CE9E8F
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0x879F2AE4
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0xD348833A
impatient."
0x1B8D427A

0x0F7B6850
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0x50167242
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x85537BC4
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x15B2C0F3
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x6BC7F996
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x85BAFEB8
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0xA2C5DFD9
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0xE41F71FA
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x9697417C
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0xDF26B50A
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x282ED0AC
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x99191946
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x783A3319
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x6E2B192B
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x4539F417
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xC3E3AD31
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0xDACD6142
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0xF3C832FF
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x9DAB113C
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0xBF7F7556

0x0F7B6850
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0xA48086B7
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x8056EA32
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x044520C4
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0xDE975883

0x0F7B6850
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0xB662A711
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xC6B7A230
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x877D8B01

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0xDEDCDC75

0x0F7B6850
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x52768EDD
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x6621600C
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0xEBFA176C
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x5702B6F2
deepening into total obscurity.
0xCF9EC067

0x0F7B6850
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0xC9CC38AD
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x1C1128C7
his journey."
0x547B4DD4

0x0F7B6850
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x407EF08A

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x524B4E7F
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x75BBA2DB
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x7D4A23CF
Colonel Dent, and others."
0xC7DACB10

0x0F7B6850
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0xC6693296

0x0F7B6850
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xEFEC6044
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0xF21FA9D6
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0xAB7A44AC
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x5C6D6520
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0xAFEF71D4
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0x092B2165
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x29421AF1
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x4DCA6E61
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xDE61EFD0
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x5B1C7691

0x0F7B6850
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0xC9368C02

0x0F7B6850
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x7FF8173E
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x8DC45205
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0xBB6CF907
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0xC35B9940
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x68346F4E
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xCFE28954
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x45BE708C
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xA3BEDF89
the evening."
0xF4C473CD

0x0F7B6850
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x6ED92B10

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x02E0DF70
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0x735C171C
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xC269C75F
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0xC2F3B4F4
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x6C2E3A09
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0xDB074218
was certainly the queen."
0x5BBB822C

0x0F7B6850
"And what was she like?"
0x74B829D6

0x0F7B6850
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0x67FB1BEE
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x27359277
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0x1454EB79
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0xCA525C7F
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x273D9701
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0x2EBE4EC8
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0xAD28F8BF
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x135C25D0
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x5776A8AE
jetty mass of her curls."
0xE6812E5E

0x0F7B6850
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
0x4E0DBC35

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x517D442B
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x373741A4
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0x34CA47DF

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0x4E5B46EA

0x0F7B6850
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0xF5BE1B95

0x0F7B6850
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0x7446C99D

0x0F7B6850
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0x2E8FDE57
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x1F7A9662
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x673A2965

0x0F7B6850
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
0x0A9C2B07

0x0F7B6850
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0xDBB9D7EB
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0xD30C713D
eldest son came in for everything almost."
0x7AAE2630

0x0F7B6850
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
0x7AFCC87A
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0xEF09D293

0x0F7B6850
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x83AF9707
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0x7A60DEB6

0x0F7B6850
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
0x1241F4DA

0x0F7B6850
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0x5978F2B7
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
0x39965C45
began tea."
0xBCEC7EA8

0x0F7B6850
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
0xE895E9DE

0x0F7B6850
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x9EE3740C
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x5B7D4DE2
conversation was turned into another channel.
0xF2F6411C

0x0F7B6850
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0xC015D16A
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x0F01F710
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0xF3AF68B1
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0xA3851E93

0x0F7B6850
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x295464C1
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x5D9C2F2D
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x90C1F372
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x2DFFDBBF
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x5D58723B
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0xE32272CC

0x0F7B6850
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0xCAE99EE6
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0x0601596E
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x4D8CF5F2

0x0F7B6850
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xE82A1012
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0xDA4701FB
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x12D71E80
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x0AD64ED2
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x22010D09
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0xC98CD528
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xADCACB24
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0xEFC86AAF
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0x709E7268
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xA108B6DC
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0xF889E1D6
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0xB42C5FEA
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x7566C756
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x5E6E23F0
is no extrication.
0xE24F42C3

0x0F7B6850
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0xEDAC748B
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xA0F7B607
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x02E70009
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x1A33F392
poor, and plain.'
0x6E236418

0x0F7B6850
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0x4FE405F2
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0x2417C502
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0xFA2093B2
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xA7991ACD
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x7AFB0095
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0xED083B3F
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x31469650
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x86231E54
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x2F664777
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x6443AA34
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0xA27DA4A3
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0x1F5624E8
accomplished lady of rank.'
0x6049216C

0x0F7B6850
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0x1665FC6D
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x53B1183F
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x6A297192
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x6E4A974C
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x9429907E

0x0F7B6850
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x300DE283
calm, and fell asleep.
0x4C39EEB0

0x0F7B6850
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0x33767BDA
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0xF3EC3BFD
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x55329E06
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x5C0DCACD
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0xBDABA4D2
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x800A4EEC
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x8DAE8F42

0x0F7B6850
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x0E84014D
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x42E79EBF
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x44FBB4C7
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x8CF4F7DE
maintain, even externally.
0x1909E8D6

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XVII
0xB6279615

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xC9BD3CA8
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0x7C080655
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xED92FEFE
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xCA783464
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xA439476E
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x016189C0
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0xC792AD1A
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x8FBD4A60
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0x23B71E10
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0xD8636132
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x49BB3B2A
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xCD381779
on the contrary, I just said--
0xC3C5BF72

0x0F7B6850
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x318011D8
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0xE145BCD9
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xA8F15FC0
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0xA54B84C0
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x3B16314A
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xECB8A037
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0xC5DE237A
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0x0EDB3C9F
wanted and would be despised."
0xE11845EA

0x0F7B6850
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0xC0124EA1
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x724A4FAF
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x5F34DBF7
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0xA5810E1A
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0xDF87BE3B

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x7E962998
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x3AA339FB

0x0F7B6850
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x4941102B
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x3900188E

0x0F7B6850
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0xE260A9B4
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x61C95D38
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x18C2432C
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0xFF7A36EB
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0xA5AA936E

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x17D54322
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x04A917D3
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x4269990D

0x0F7B6850
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x478861D2
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x84B665A2
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0xAF7EEE81

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x09C8B2CF

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x0AEC8DC5
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0xB3952A08
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x2A62FB51
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x718B54F6
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0xB0E4CB4A
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0xC940A7F3
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x1D2EA143
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x7011F675

0x0F7B6850
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x3B060D57
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0xA0305EE9
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0xF65BA4A2
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x9CF7DA6A
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x00D039C6
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xCA2DB4E0
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0xA3A33983
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0x4662E3CB
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x7A759314
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x30FF6549
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x6835BC72
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x0977E944
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x93431FDC
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x373BE677
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x5687BB21
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0x660EC7BB
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x0CAEFFF2
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x1CBE8CCC

0x0F7B6850
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0x52DBEF93
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x6AD40A72
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x8B9D39F9
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x552C4197
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x10679F10
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x78428DD9
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0xE4812216
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x21B7A1F9
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0x7E84FA2C
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x89D3853A
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x105C0E6E
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x3D8B753E
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x921DF584
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x5D4ADA7F
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0xFA6FDB43
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0xEF404FFF
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x1DC6C354
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x738F0120
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x9A4D0C64
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x458DBC2A

0x0F7B6850
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0xEADAC4D8
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0xDE12ED43
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x15F9E189
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0xEECDA5FE
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x4411BC9D
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x1341219D

0x0F7B6850
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x157B4509

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0x881E71CF
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0xEBC6075C
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0x84B0452E
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0x30221C13
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x890A9672
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0x139B3CA5
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x24FC507A

0x0F7B6850
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x53D0DC30

0x0F7B6850
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x08AE419C
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0xB29829F7
the money she gets."
0xE0B3B2B6

0x0F7B6850
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x04424B50

0x0F7B6850
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0xDE471EA9
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0x55470B7F

0x0F7B6850
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x679F4E7B

0x0F7B6850
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x9990E4AE
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0x26852BB3
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0xDB981AC7
excluded.
0xC4730911

0x0F7B6850
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xE694DC4E
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x64472E63
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xF913A743
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x74D3F683
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0xC539D04B
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0xB238E2C9
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x3EDD08C1
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0xE8001C36
sides.
0xBBC0033D

0x0F7B6850
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x3C51B668
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xD5D54673
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x8851338C
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0x5F80C696
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0x1D09CAA2
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x429FCECC
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x5EB5BB26
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0xDE981FDE
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0xB4FF04A6

0x0F7B6850
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0xD19458B9
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x310365CB
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x17950BF3
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0x7FB5A623

0x0F7B6850
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0x346271A6
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x2C00FDF3
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xFB109883
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x8BB428F4
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x7E22BAB6
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x85D4A324

0x0F7B6850
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x2898D663
minutes."
0x89FBD744

0x0F7B6850
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x076C38E0
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x77A28149

0x0F7B6850
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x41F308F4
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x3295F697
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0xAEE1ECBB
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xF58868C9
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x5B1C2013
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xE2B02D4B
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x007DF5AF
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0xCC9932CF
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0xC35F4D0D

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0x7720EC4D
below.
0x968B5E2C

0x0F7B6850
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0x279BF70F
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x1408FE20
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x96602542
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0xBF07772D
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x30B850DD
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x44ED0F01
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x5ED7AEE5

0x0F7B6850
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x737367C0
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x77B81033
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0xCF4D0A76
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x53C0852B
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x1FD8420C
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0xB11A157D
and, for a time, a hush.
0xC3040D5F

0x0F7B6850
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x9179E220
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x391C39DB

0x0F7B6850
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xF87958F8
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x5A6A91C3
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0xB0A0766B
on apprend."
0xE1290EFD

0x0F7B6850
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0xD41D55F9

0x0F7B6850
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xEA7602F2
mange."
0xCAE6FF96

0x0F7B6850
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xB967941F
get you something to eat."
0x90750DA6

0x0F7B6850
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x25D81098
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xC332EFEA
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x038E7B97
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xAEC988A8
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x6B527C38
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0xAA1EE4BE
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x0E136203
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x4B5239D0
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x0B4D0A42
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0x2D5750E8
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0xBDA49448
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0xF0B13ACC
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xD0258CFB
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0x68500F21
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0xE0EE0E82
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x7EDD523E
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x53517DBF

0x0F7B6850
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x1133A49F
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x5BF50767
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x6A86C8DE
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0xA8B6E30E
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0xA770A1B9
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0x6350C1D8
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x82D39A18

0x0F7B6850
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0xDA2B2856
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x6C79857F
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x7990D7B5
dinner?"
0xF84F5233

0x0F7B6850
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0xD789A543
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0xDBFBCF17
is your dinner."
0x68883B39

0x0F7B6850
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x28EB5D77
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x11BF13BC
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0xFD58AB0D
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x8563EAD0
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x59556855
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x6729E9B4
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x84173F24
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0xEF5FE804
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xEB59D739
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0x36705A57
quel dommage!"
0x5FB7E4FB

0x0F7B6850
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x2D580972
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0x4675A16B
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x7BFBBAE5
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0x20C8C171
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0xE60CA8C2
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x5AF03BA1
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0xC7EF874F
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x0EC888FA
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0xF76E162A
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x4D6E8AD9
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0xB714E976
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x41FD1EC7
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x1E93613E
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xB66A551E

0x0F7B6850
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x8A178704
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0xF31E5252
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0xF67894C2
sought their chambers.
0x97E4E717

0x0F7B6850
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0xDB4EF004
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0x6063C5A4
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0xF8693716
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x4A85B98A
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x7C8615E7
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x122B10EA
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0xB07C779A

0x0F7B6850
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0xBA03855F
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x16C869D4
ladies."
0x7EBE2398

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x0717478D

0x0F7B6850
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0x05BA12F4
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0x509F490E
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x588BFA99

0x0F7B6850
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0xA2F67CFE
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0x9DF90BE6
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0xA61DE690
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xD3F773E3

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0x44C474C9
answered.
0x7DF03541

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0xE81C0961
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x7B3FCAD8
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0xDB6EB08D
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0x279AB2D2
case of contumacy.'"
0x460911A3

0x0F7B6850
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x1FDA8560
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x3600A1FF

0x0F7B6850
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x6A4FC5E1
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xADE4CA44
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xE6C7DA01
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0xA38D0778
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xAA7B4644
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x1DF48877
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x94001FB1

0x0F7B6850
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x27FE0F66

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0xEF2D9539
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x9D47994A
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0xCCB4DC14
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0xDEFF3100
stay at Thornfield."
0xA20B5859

0x0F7B6850
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0xC4064383
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x7326BFF0
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0xA766B56D
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x3FE608DA
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x5635A180
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x2DD3138A
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0x32450DEB
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x37C37AA0
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0xAC4B5669
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xD166B724
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x01941E64
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xFC4CFFCE
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0xBEB3178D
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xBE10EE4A
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x8F152A61
descended.
0x9D59741B

0x0F7B6850
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x8E10A71B
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x8D07B1F2
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0x7C41C0A8
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0x80813CB2
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0x413A6E06
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x80DA901C
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x9D23A313
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x8F04B500

0x0F7B6850
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0x4A8B17D7
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0x3C1FA20D
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x5DAE988D
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xC9EEBA28
touched my knee.
0x01DAA9E9

0x0F7B6850
"What is it, Adele?"
0x1019EA19

0x0F7B6850
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x8AA2707A
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x45030636

0x0F7B6850
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x01C5FE4A
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x69C18B61
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0xBF7ED436
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x56625E17
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x6FA2148F
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x35A434A8

0x0F7B6850
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0x689AA727
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x7EA871C9
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x84416A92
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x197D78FF
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0xAE2053F2

0x0F7B6850
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x5CAED9C3
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xAA54BB37
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0xB96FCB33
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0x06C0FF8E
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x18EAA03A
stared at me.
0x39B7376B

0x0F7B6850
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x5FD585A5
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0x2EC7B3AB
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0xB0A3A84F
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x5495BF09
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0xF5FC5C43
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0xA1312337
and may as well mention them now.
0x9AC9D0D7

0x0F7B6850
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0x5A09DDD4
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0xF912DF9E
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xAEA3E7B3
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x2EC17755
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x663A3EC7
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0xD9EAFCB8
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x23932183

0x0F7B6850
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x6C0C9BC3
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x66329AE3
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x35B4A501
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x2A66D5F0

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xFE778A9C
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0x0D9FF693
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x88F229C6
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xF5059D38

0x0F7B6850
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x6BDBE9AA
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x828DE7ED
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x3A43B02C
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x760212B4
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0xFAD7E48C
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x97E82347
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0xC37C85A5
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x909C80D0
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x3D6F8592
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0xEE760BA2
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0xE0C971F7
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xC2FBD461
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x4756AF67
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0xC42A9737
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0x1B5CCA7A
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x2BEB4069
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0x79EEDC62
truly imperial dignity.
0xCD1A5C3F

0x0F7B6850
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x5564119D
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x97748D01
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x3DDD324A
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0x20D2768D
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0x3C9F5C51
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x06D6D3DA
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0xBF5B8991

0x0F7B6850
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x3571DC46
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x0CE26549
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x68254FC2
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0x24A6CABA
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x121C03B4
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0xA23ACDAC
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x690BD6F0
haughty lip.
0x9CBE4539

0x0F7B6850
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x618DD174
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x8FAC7860
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x5F1CA7A8
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x23B55B67
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0xF639BAB3
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xA3F42A99
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x8E23A947
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x7AE6AECF
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0xC0120668
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0x673D7938
with fluency and with a good accent.
0xB084A795

0x0F7B6850
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x622C3E9E
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0xCCED0081
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x1D94EFD3
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0x6BB8D006
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0xF5520C5A
in spotless white.
0xA7A625E5

0x0F7B6850
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0xE0C28487
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x2651C067
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x4295BC20
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x36248902
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x5C638EA0
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0xDCF2FD0D
together.
0x4F6A1189

0x0F7B6850
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x7A3AFEA1
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0xDF64F190
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0xB4C59869
gravity--
0x74AA16C6

0x0F7B6850
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0x925E4FFE

0x0F7B6850
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0xF4F5D726
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0xC9E94302

0x0F7B6850
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x71462AD8
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x1064B097

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x21F61953

0x0F7B6850
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x768335C7
child!"
0xB8641F6B

0x0F7B6850
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xD19F085F
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x425ACED7
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x1F876C6B
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x7C838789

0x0F7B6850
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0x126B1C1E
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x3749A06F
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0xEDB178FD
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xA7D73CA3
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x4A1BC2CF
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x80FC49D9
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x8C85171F
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0xBA0520DD
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x32AC001E
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x9C9D484F
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x28528CA6
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0xF6467EAF
blood or vigour of brain.
0x64FC1276

0x0F7B6850
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x4C3628D7

0x0F7B6850
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x0544DE5C
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x49954919
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0xFD1BCCF0
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x9C241567
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x508187CE
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x28CB8228
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x0B06938B
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0x717F1E8F
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0x8516760E
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xC10A9941
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x71154EA8
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xE219C37F
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0xC77E58FA
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x20E08A7E

0x0F7B6850
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x6B379C68
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x13DAA308
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x19E7CF03
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0x79D20028
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0x21758E22
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x0D539968
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xADA1F12C
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x1D416C9C

0x0F7B6850
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x803AD0A2
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0xFB3E6E22
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0xC2676063
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x5A0D06CE
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x70FED37A
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x8A384C9E
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x85334877
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x9A2AB362
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x5F76B243
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0xD580DBCC

0x0F7B6850
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x392A3DBE
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xB79AEB27
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x6110FACF
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0xDC3C1F0D
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0x4017018B
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0x299D7A87
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x0F15C851
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0xC330F3C0
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x4A9D2D69
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0xDDCB21A5
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x49CB76F5
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x94EE7B73
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x29A85DD4
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x79ECE14B
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x49EE9009
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0x6F63578E
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0x962CC9B8
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xB3D8789A
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0xB4968466
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x5AF15DD8
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x82B21E7F
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x4F127191
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x5D6460BD
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xA82C8075
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0x62402905
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0x505D075E
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x73A0235E
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0xBDDA4802
breathe and think, I must love him."
0x3D805769

0x0F7B6850
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x3ECA0D1B
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x575D736B
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x655A9FE9
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x5DACDC4B
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0x852E1E72
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x2798C8EB
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0x6F4C907B
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0xF07ABF90
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x739D9250
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x9B79AFC1
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0xC2B6B8BB
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0xA73FDDB9
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0xDC42211D
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x741E94EF
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0xCB70E022
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xB705B01E
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x56AFACDF
selects a mate.
0xA2BCB1EA

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x059EEE4C
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x9DDC8D3C
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0xED56718E

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x6E8DA9C6

0x0F7B6850
"Nor am I."
0xC8890C66

0x0F7B6850
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0xCB76E34A
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x3CE7B4A7

0x0F7B6850
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x1E8FA521

0x0F7B6850
"You should have sent her to school."
0xF4169C30

0x0F7B6850
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0xF036EA29

0x0F7B6850
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0xA4810F25
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x62A04117
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x5E3D8A27
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0xFF398463

0x0F7B6850
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0xCD59B372
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x67C19F6B
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0xE11A7884

0x0F7B6850
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0xC9A54C95
straight before him.
0x9BB9068B

0x0F7B6850
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0xDA5A0AB4
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0xED12B05E
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0xE91DB554
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x43707815

0x0F7B6850
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x1B93BB99

0x0F7B6850
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0x6CE541CF
her question with an explanation.
0xA15235EE

0x0F7B6850
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0xF3040C73
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x67FD8C01
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0x1FCFB3EF

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0xA6C3E248
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0x5D0517E5
the anathematised race was present.
0x496AE578

0x0F7B6850
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0x01218D66
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0x93FCD5F4
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0x07BEE46C

0x0F7B6850
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0xE7DC6219

0x0F7B6850
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x3226D7D9
three times with portentous significancy.
0x2DD91C78

0x0F7B6850
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
0x2B2A5472

0x0F7B6850
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
0x4CEA7E0F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x381C09D5
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x0A613F06
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x6EA83551
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x81DA6527
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x5C075F25
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x285B4476
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x242D245E
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0xFDF50D54
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x7919EB67
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0xB4F6A86F
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0x302608A0
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0xF28C4777

0x0F7B6850
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0x504DBD09
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x07304975
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x6D8371DB
when she was herself so ignorant."
0x07150658

0x0F7B6850
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0x77938A55
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0xF9A0CB0D
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0x364AF181
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x517BBBC9
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0xEEF9F5C4
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0x5324F637
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0x63F6B2F6
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0xB3C53F33
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0x76BAEC47
lady-mother?"
0x169A9B21

0x0F7B6850
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0x25A086E0
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x71D80B25
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
0xD630F376

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0xFFF7382F
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0xD9E0D0D1
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0xC08F210C
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0x0F86D859
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0x8F04A234

0x0F7B6850
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
0xEA2B2CCF

0x0F7B6850
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
0x84AB824A

0x0F7B6850
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x64A77A3C
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0x945471DA
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x3A4A418B
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0xCABC5741

0x0F7B6850
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0x3DCE6F05
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x49D4E45F
she would give us anything we asked for."
0xF81AB2D5

0x0F7B6850
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0xB33F9D32
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0x9197F03C
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0x46A36626
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0xEB6C15CA

0x0F7B6850
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
0x73CBDA72

0x0F7B6850
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x17366795
in voice to-night?"
0xE220481F

0x0F7B6850
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
0xCB7DE9D5

0x0F7B6850
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0x2A857CF6
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x741672E6

0x0F7B6850
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0xC69549E4

0x0F7B6850
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0x20563249
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xECF446F2
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x876A3A6A
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0x81D6E065
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x513C4009
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xBC0FE187
hand."
0x32E4EE6D

0x0F7B6850
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0x599423F3
Mr. Rochester.
0xDA2E16CC

0x0F7B6850
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0xB9EDFB32

0x0F7B6850
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0x290E9B11

0x0F7B6850
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0xA12B939A
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0xAAFCF9ED
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x7B91C895
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0xCF45E707
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0xF0CE52F1
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x35876EA2

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x9BB26708
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0xEE9D4E9B
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0xB41826EA
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0xF047AB69
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x079AB5EB
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0x0D54B45F
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x0ECE0601
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x58221890
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x9A36D18C
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x584E4BF1
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0x16CD15DF

0x0F7B6850
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0xCA60A97E
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x3BB1777A
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0x1D3F467B
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0xFDA78230
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0x81D01F39

0x0F7B6850
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x9213DF98

0x0F7B6850
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
0x272FAE19
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0x91A24F66

0x0F7B6850
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0x40AE515B
water."
0x38C07024

0x0F7B6850
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0x42C6A4C9
such things _should_ be done."
0x130E2848

0x0F7B6850
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
0x4F0720E7
fail."
0x9CC1AF20

0x0F7B6850
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
0x91E04EDC
proportionate punishment."
0x12D86471

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x034565C1
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0xD303B41B

0x0F7B6850
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0xBB637B89

0x0F7B6850
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0xF223D4AB
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0x8B826AEF
capital punishment."
0xA8778798

0x0F7B6850
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x82A9B28C
accompaniment in spirited style.
0xB18B52D0

0x0F7B6850
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x9F4F6321
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0x1B2AE245
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0xC04097D8
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xB98988E1
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x7680459B
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x6033E38B
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0xFCF2AE8E
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x7B700F1E
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x2CB9C4D7
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x765AC419
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xDC7A4FDE
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0xDA281983

0x0F7B6850
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x5E25B537

0x0F7B6850
"I am very well, sir."
0x70319827

0x0F7B6850
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0xEC23594B

0x0F7B6850
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0xCC742D0E
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0xFF2A4945

0x0F7B6850
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x3870187E

0x0F7B6850
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x9959A4E6

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x241375D4

0x0F7B6850
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x3D7AE9F1
What is the matter?"
0x462CF1A5

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x1C197B29

0x0F7B6850
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x77FD9C48

0x0F7B6850
"Not the least."
0xE88C9B85

0x0F7B6850
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x15B47095

0x0F7B6850
"I am tired, sir."
0x99149F29

0x0F7B6850
He looked at me for a minute.
0x037A228A

0x0F7B6850
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x775268AF

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x5F2F3292

0x0F7B6850
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x41363945
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x40F41E39
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x1DDAD498
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x60753FF7
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0x9FE44763
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x3387DF5A
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0xB7D107CC
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x70FC2B89
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
0xBCADFA63

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XVIII
0x676E627E

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x14A3D2EA
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x0A0FC308
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x4C959C69
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x278FA4CE
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x7126CE65
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0xA723D712
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x20736FCB

0x0F7B6850
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0x36759F91
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xCC317413
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0xFA42967A
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x7240C9B7
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xB3A24F0A
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x753FA192
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0xDA4A47BC

0x0F7B6850
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0xB96A7319
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x99899127
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x3F172F21
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x214BFA85
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xAE9EAF4E
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x57F83FAA
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0xFFD81702
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x2616ECF8
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x24B88EDA
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x57846277
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x8BF35793
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0x4868039B
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0xC57E3ED2
drawing-room.
0x3BF82AD9

0x0F7B6850
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x656AA92D
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0xECE5F3A7
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0xD736A718
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0x1FBE7EFB
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x3C6655E2

0x0F7B6850
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0xB49BA7F1
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0xF6DA5DBF
usual seat.
0x5CDA5631

0x0F7B6850
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x6BFD2073
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0xD4680EE9
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xE69BF791
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x07DB3872

0x0F7B6850
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0xD89891D0

0x0F7B6850
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xD8469DF9
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x335722ED
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xC599CD0B
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0xA1BF0CA1
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0x3E015F9F
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0xC95711D6
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0xFA2758AB
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xC6BD0E51
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x662A887A
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x1CAF0F0C
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x91BECDB4
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x1585B59F
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x2E669A03
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x0AC0DB5A
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0xC10B6339

0x0F7B6850
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xDEE2E759

0x0F7B6850
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0xE9A4D635
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x9392AB55
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x142C5AB4
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x966EE7D9
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x19FF38CA
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x510D2ADE
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x24B48529
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0xF6D6F80E

0x0F7B6850
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x7A0AEB21
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x0CC7AA92
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x8FA28CB7
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x64C01A52
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0x6463A1A1
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x8F79A05B
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0xB0E2FC2B
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x8BE0F779
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0x4F23AD76
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x4A3EEF89
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0x466F7231
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x7156F4DD

0x0F7B6850
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x6665A005
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x6E85D7DA
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x3D011A1B
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xC5137FEA
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x5B28BEDC
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xC88236F1
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x14870E26
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x5D73A257
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0xF82886F2
wanting.
0x0FE41834

0x0F7B6850
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x95908B6E
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x17EC9943
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x44A16A95
curtain again descended.
0x08F57E7A

0x0F7B6850
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x719B3CA4
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x460A408C
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0x5F7A581B
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0x7466FAD1
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0x94FA6239

0x0F7B6850
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x74A9628D
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x37BA37EB
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0xEA50FE63
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xBDB26FAF
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0xF732FF38
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x666C375C
attached fetters.
0xC107D1F9

0x0F7B6850
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0x5235015C

0x0F7B6850
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x1CBDAC9B
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x09EE736A
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x1C9B0FA7

0x0F7B6850
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0xF4DD90C0
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x35588B60
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x0D700947

0x0F7B6850
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0xFF301CC0

0x0F7B6850
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x52DCEA9B
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x1BACB03F

0x0F7B6850
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0x84C469DB

0x0F7B6850
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0xEA02E9B4
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x7BABF87A

0x0F7B6850
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xA42F9121
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xE0C5A11F
colour rose.
0x6FA5B7BA

0x0F7B6850
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0xB7DAE7F1
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x91A9B762
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0xCE172357
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x2C084656
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x15D23178
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0x4CB600CD
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x6721B455
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0x5AC38144
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0xC7466966
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0xEDF69448
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xC4B7D842
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0xAC059BA1
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xFE002183
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x4B589C5C
returns in memory at this moment.
0x2CF647F4

0x0F7B6850
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0xD0D56B88
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x064E5CAB
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x69C5465D
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x9A52B466
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0xBB5C9935
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x53E886C3
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x90F5877D
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0xAE187765
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0x6A075CFA
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x97860195
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x497332B4
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0x879DA19A
very pride, irresistible.
0x6E8730F1

0x0F7B6850
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0x951B8605
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x074A6C13
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x05525B96
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x60F2BF53
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x61B63A8E
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0xC0F5EF61
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0x65C6A3EB
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x5F9712C5
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0xD14ED290
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x71C75FB4
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x8C810978
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0x31F33670
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x33A1CA98
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x05B5387F
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x5FEB285E
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0x3E82D9F0
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0xD3A33515
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x9363F7A2
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0x750DDCAC
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0xB000F043
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0x1EA397EB
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x7F80D1E0
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x397FCFEA
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x9DC9C516
torturing pain arose.
0x719545D1

0x0F7B6850
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x3CA31E0E
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0x202B61B5
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0xE5A5CEDA
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x5A39AFC8
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x6F46A64D
not charm him_.
0xBA1B0FBD

0x0F7B6850
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0xE0CC8FEA
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0xFBB3BF69
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x1D1420FC
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x1427DF5F
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x6D53E721
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0xDAFDDF3B
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x273BC5A9
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x089744CF
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x06A0E459
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0xBCC8C33C
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x88D6FA23
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xF1B43570
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0xD23E2F18
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x1C5EA21E
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0xC56B8DED

0x0F7B6850
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xEDF97253
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xAF20A2A1
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0x67FF9F25
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x6E629361
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x18E5D147
silent conquest might have been won.
0x8E9E1046

0x0F7B6850
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xF7FCC017
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0xED835F52
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x53330785
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x4A7DEB0F
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0x5BEBB3ED
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xBA4ACB4E
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xC6C7A391
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x20EFB9C2
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0x9E771DCD
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0x511DABA6
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0xFF861D35
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x38F2F87A
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xD10004D2
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x32EB63C2
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x9E8A4837
shines on."
0xCEBBA39C

0x0F7B6850
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x2112DDC1
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x2B9B7924
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xE8F36004
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0x7D798641
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0xB3988428
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0xA435500E
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0xB80B2919
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x1404DC00
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x1D10DA83
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x5A7480A5
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xA74ED3B7
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x2E982D55
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0xCF40A0C7
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x3139BAB7
as I wished to act.
0x78A52B69

0x0F7B6850
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0xC142033F
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0xCD60C995
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x22BABF88
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x6F1389D4
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x5C8A61D2
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x98EBC0FF
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x0E2A987F
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0xA31F6ACF
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x1B9C8DFD
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0xE86DF7AE
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x89F8E52F
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x7CEBA0F4
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x48F4F877
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0xCDEBAEA1
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x7F72806A
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0xE64D42EB
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x1BAFD23D
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0xE521FF7A
nature.
0x127C56D2

0x0F7B6850
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0xB005B8CC
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0x8F875FC0
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x46CB057F
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x9B119CB5
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0xDBB833F8
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0xF5853EE3
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0xCEE33482
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x0020E609
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x18309D48
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xBAF386A9
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0xE53FE873
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0xC200C012
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0xB50A9E05
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xEB3BB7AC
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0xAA103F61
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x81E13C8C
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x2DEFB984
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0xC5C4D970
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x2A4B64C4
vivacity of conversation.
0x5AC798B8

0x0F7B6850
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x23AB7CAA
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x82DBD70B
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x6CF517F8
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x3F231338
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0xCAE83C79
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0xFE252CEB
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x84F9FE21
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0x2A6F7523
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0xFB3AAB51
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xD39EDF2F
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x1A7FDA81
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x39FC6375
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xE510FF2B
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x263DBED8
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x45AD8FB9

0x0F7B6850
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x82068EF1
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0x2216496D
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x5C9EE282

0x0F7B6850
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x67137092

0x0F7B6850
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0x17B4CCB9
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x907D0D51
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xEF9D6523
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x695727DB

0x0F7B6850
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0xF723B13C
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x9093F164
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x2C15D74E

0x0F7B6850
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x52183D38
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x9AC1965C
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x0F2DEAC3
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x8D61704A
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0xCEC4A982
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0x34212938
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0x9EFFD856

0x0F7B6850
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x58445BC1
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0xA909AB5A
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0x186900DD

0x0F7B6850
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0xEA747AB4
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0x6C2749D2

0x0F7B6850
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0x0357425F
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x52FF380B
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0xFDAEA15B
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0xE828933F

0x0F7B6850
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0xE155BE0D
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x1A3E6D80
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0xB3568BD6
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x7189D036
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x50C7BF01
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0xBB829E9F
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x25E17397
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x0D7A685E
least so I thought.
0x372344F3

0x0F7B6850
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x100F9F7B
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0x92006833
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0xA8170E6E
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0x5BC74723
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0x2B5F3FFC
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0xC13511C6
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x7EA50066
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x53B0D7DF
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0x0BC07862
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0xCDA3A700

0x0F7B6850
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x437CBA98
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x2CEDAA66
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x5F8A3AAB
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0xE69E2AF3
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x81F4D97B
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x1A661D36
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0xB20E063E

0x0F7B6850
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xA7EE2BD6
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x3961BC25
that "extremes meet."
0x05104F74

0x0F7B6850
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0x70EE4A16
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0xA991D4FC
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0xBCAF75AF
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0xCD510CDB
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x84742F07
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x442451D1
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x45CF444B
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x134D61BB

0x0F7B6850
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x27C28794
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x895E957F
a placid eye and smile!"
0xE20E9845

0x0F7B6850
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x68E9CA52
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0x14BC3D67
Hay Common.
0xFE0648BE

0x0F7B6850
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x5A28466F
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x4A5F8D29
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xDA449C9A
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x34EF8195
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0xE53DBA15
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xED8490BF
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0xC016146E
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xD2587C0B
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x613D092A
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0x4A4583D8
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x4DB57CE0
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xF5E834D1
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0xD75D6E1D

0x0F7B6850
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x536E9C6C
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x80C36D97
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0xB735C086
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xC1175D0C
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x380E825E
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0xE245C195
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0xCBB3DA29

0x0F7B6850
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0xF64BB6F0
off," replied the magistrate.
0x99E4042D

0x0F7B6850
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0x14E3C8E2
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0xFAD1911B
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x047B30BD
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0x81B2B3C1
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0xB9F2CB2A
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xAD064664
see her?"
0x6616F139

0x0F7B6850
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0xE2570FAC
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x2CB209E7

0x0F7B6850
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0xF941B878
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x7EAC3A2E
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x9776F813
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0xE13D85EF

0x0F7B6850
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x275AA940

0x0F7B6850
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x60D693A2
must and will do it."
0xA56C149B

0x0F7B6850
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x435843E1

0x0F7B6850
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0x34BE7534

0x0F7B6850
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xE6AEFE15
in, of course."
0x46097E71

0x0F7B6850
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0xC9731DD3
throw away such a chance of fun."
0x976F625C

0x0F7B6850
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0xEBDC3C59

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0xA01CF982
in the Dowager Ingram.
0x727DD034

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x73198E80
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x9598BAD7
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x4F3C8B54
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0xEF731CC6
forward."
0xDA787952

0x0F7B6850
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0xFECD3031

0x0F7B6850
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x00D2AB6E
Sam!"
0xA8BF2C13

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x3B0E52DB
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x55C2216A

0x0F7B6850
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0xBC8317D8

0x0F7B6850
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0xB08764F4

0x0F7B6850
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x4C63F10D
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xA90569B3

0x0F7B6850
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x1DA800D7
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x549D505B
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x50D7279C
one."
0x767AE311

0x0F7B6850
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x43366FEC
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0xBB8A98C6

0x0F7B6850
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0xE22BADE9
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x1EC521C9
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x572E6F7E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0x5BC03769

0x0F7B6850
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x6E4E6FB9

0x0F7B6850
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x9FF40278
once more.
0xE1231A5F

0x0F7B6850
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x87FCB044
know who will be her first visitor."
0xBB4ACFF2

0x0F7B6850
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x99D5F768
said Colonel Dent.
0x120BD1CC

0x0F7B6850
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x896FE8B9

0x0F7B6850
Sam went and returned.
0xDA7B5CA1

0x0F7B6850
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x106621CF
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x4879C346
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x0621DF90

0x0F7B6850
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0x401D4974

0x0F7B6850
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0xFDB82370
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x8E95877A
of his men.
0xF833A6F8

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0xBD9D06F8
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0xA1CC7479
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0xA4B0B4DF

0x0F7B6850
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0x1FA70067
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x3C89ED78
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x73110A58
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x8D9FB7CB

0x0F7B6850
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0xB6FFDCCD
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0x29575F50

0x0F7B6850
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0xAE9661AD
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xFAF07A0D
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x6240504B
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x939CB3D7

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x16F0A0A3

0x0F7B6850
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x47B89DD9

0x0F7B6850
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0xE8753773
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0x3F704CFC

0x0F7B6850
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0x331EB878
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x63C3DE70
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xD1D0A3CF
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0xBF996F3B
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x2B5AEB86
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0xD62D7D76
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0xE0478564
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0x0F2C05FA
morning, as he threatened."
0xB8357BE1

0x0F7B6850
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0xF7C3168D
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0xE5E0282C
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0xBBE49152
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x89485C1C
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x2D30BD24
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0xAA5205B3
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x36F11A1A
whatever revelations had been made her.
0x3AB580D8

0x0F7B6850
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0xC3EB8236

0x0F7B6850
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0xF0B4AE5F
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0x359D3F87
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0xE6EEAA72
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0xD9AD5954
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0x1040AA0A
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0xF61259D1

0x0F7B6850
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0x8DDA1376
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0x11415983
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xA70D1F87
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x4F66225E

0x0F7B6850
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xCDE91C46
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0xCA8C5F68
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0xFA0F99D5

0x0F7B6850
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xC6D096E2
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0xA7186EA6
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x889CCBB7
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0xDEF66E69
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x7DEBAF9E
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x4188BD35
they most wished for.
0x4C888229

0x0F7B6850
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0xC8B67A0E
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x53A4B6D7
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x80C5AD00
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0x508A6EBA
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0xC87F70B6
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xF3A6A10C
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x8079BEAD

0x0F7B6850
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x44C992C1
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x6477A5F2
saw Sam.
0x90818A76

0x0F7B6850
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x821071EB
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0x2D210B21
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0xCE7ECE6B
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0x609AAB6F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0xD336E2B6
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x6C92C8DB
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0xEA1C6C1B
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0x695C06F8
quietly behind me.
0xE96D5F80

0x0F7B6850
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0x143B52D1
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x8E3879F6

0x0F7B6850
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0xA94E2D10
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.

CHAPTER XIX
0x941787CE

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x4C4D3D5D
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0x1F7DF600
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0xCD4938D5
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x14E7E550
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0x41339EEB
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0xB8BBCE25
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0xFB4006D4
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0x8D0B47FD
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0xBEE8D6D5

0x0F7B6850
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x15F14B26
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0xF036E7EF
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x63B19E99
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x0E54C3DB
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x6D5077B0
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x7B695C80
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0xD157FD2C
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0xEA610C70
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xC160B33B

0x0F7B6850
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0xD9D103FD
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0xE451A405

0x0F7B6850
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0xCD19816E
warn you, I have no faith."
0x1FEF0AD0

0x0F7B6850
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0xEE754F7C
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0x2F492FE2

0x0F7B6850
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0xBA3BCE9D

0x0F7B6850
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x0801C801

0x0F7B6850
"You need them all in your trade."
0xE2E622F6

0x0F7B6850
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0x38501FDD
you tremble?"
0x327AFF5D

0x0F7B6850
"I'm not cold."
0x81C44FC5

0x0F7B6850
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0x1F9DB947

0x0F7B6850
"I am not sick."
0xAF47A88F

0x0F7B6850
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0xAF63298B

0x0F7B6850
"I'm not silly."
0x9B1CDB30

0x0F7B6850
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x80B95782
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x1A46B052
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0xAFF3AAD3
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x0E34645D
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x11205AB8

0x0F7B6850
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0x59900E24

0x0F7B6850
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x9782B57D
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x35DAEF71
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x01DE2270
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0xED36E0DB
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x205ED9FB
you."
0x889FF9EF

0x0F7B6850
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0xA9896D2D
with vigour.
0x02985DA3

0x0F7B6850
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0xA5E3B351
solitary dependent in a great house."
0x4E34C391

0x0F7B6850
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0xAD7FA26F
one?"
0x305CC151

0x0F7B6850
"In my circumstances."
0x0A121060

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0xFEDB7FEC
placed as you are."
0xFC2F5BE5

0x0F7B6850
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x4532108F

0x0F7B6850
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0x52FBA3D1
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x9AC4D1B8
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0x59255BDE
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0x6CBE03C6

0x0F7B6850
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0xFDC04C30

0x0F7B6850
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0x2EF5CA84

0x0F7B6850
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x1BFD0E4A

0x0F7B6850
"To be sure."
0xECA0861C

0x0F7B6850
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x97989E3C
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0x7DFF9505
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0xF4F82862
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0x041E32AF

0x0F7B6850
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xC8C673B0
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x16EA0CC0
there."
0xF7B34945

0x0F7B6850
"I believe you," said I.
0x15CECDBC

0x0F7B6850
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x18C91A66
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0xD29F176A

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x2DC47061
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xFC41349B

0x0F7B6850
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x62694FE7
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0xB5CC22E2
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x1129FC4A

0x0F7B6850
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x6581F1D1
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x66249635
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0x8C012CB2
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x8840947F
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0xA2572163
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0xC024434C

0x0F7B6850
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0xC319F1B4

0x0F7B6850
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xC675AEA4
whispers of the future?"
0x3178CDE4

0x0F7B6850
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x22AD0DAD
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
0x6288759C

0x0F7B6850
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
0x0AF7CE33
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
0x94E53D0A

0x0F7B6850
"You have learned them from the servants."
0xEB6E025A

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
0xFDBF643C
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
0x9C00FE74

0x0F7B6850
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
0xA0455E8B

0x0F7B6850
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0xB4BFEF6E
after all, then!"
0x51C651EE

0x0F7B6850
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
0x77F3AFC0
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0x26964AB0
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0xA8D988AA
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
0xBA7A3E35
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
0x85DFFB0D
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
0x5AF9E1AC

0x0F7B6850
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
0x20354745

0x0F7B6850
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
0x13E700BA

0x0F7B6850
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
0xD5AC7A1B
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
0x2FD65EDD

0x0F7B6850
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
0x216E0C82

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
0xB8A648C3
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
0x49F0DAF2

0x0F7B6850
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
0xA3B14861

0x0F7B6850
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
0xE5ECAD00

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
0xA3681030
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
0x304E064E
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
0x2EC1472E

0x0F7B6850
"I what?"
0x03C0DA1A

0x0F7B6850
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
0x7317517D

0x0F7B6850
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
0x1F4EE6F6
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
0x30A27041
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
0xD6339918
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
0x590C105B
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
0xBD3AEC43
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
0x9928FDFA

0x0F7B6850
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
0x899E1E42
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
0x28D1DA5B

0x0F7B6850
"He is not at home."
0x39077CF3

0x0F7B6850
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
0x2F075764
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
0xA93C6B5B
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
0x6C0B74A7
it were, out of existence?"
0x94E86810

0x0F7B6850
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
0xC7BD940B
you had introduced."
0xFA923567

0x0F7B6850
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
0xF8E98DE8
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
0x6958EFE7
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
0x7920CF69

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
0x6936172A

0x0F7B6850
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
0xAD0B869A
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
0xE90AB3EA
the most lively and the most continuous?"
0x738592B4

0x0F7B6850
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
0xB3F01217
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
0xBEE84948
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
0xC79DBF30
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
0x669CA9D4
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
0xABE9E7B3
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
0x01ADCCDA

0x0F7B6850
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
0xD4B00DDA
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
0x42BBD243
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
0xFBC519A1
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
0xB47ECE75
noticed this?"
0x3C2F558C

0x0F7B6850
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
0x31603397

0x0F7B6850
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
0x3FF671D2
gratitude?"
0xCAD3DADE

0x0F7B6850
I said nothing.
0x3548C367

0x0F7B6850
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
0x5659F6A7
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
0xF05B58B4

0x0F7B6850
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
0x6D8AC614

0x0F7B6850
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
0xE94C13D2

0x0F7B6850
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
0x4A8A863B
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
0x332E98EA

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
0x892D48F4

0x0F7B6850
"Shortly?"
0x1BD923AD

0x0F7B6850
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
0x03A5ECC0
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
0x2B41B2D8
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
0x654FFC93
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
0xD7A85AB2
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
0x5B8968C6
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
0xB9018FB2
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
0xD930DF04
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
0x83126B27
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
0x1C646247
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
0x8C2D7C1F

0x0F7B6850
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
0x39F46CD5
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
0x3C11C755

0x0F7B6850
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
0x565B9983
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
0xD941CDA5
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
0xA9EE054C
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
0x3BB40AD4
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
0xB18F36F4
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
0xC6CEB035

0x0F7B6850
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
0xB48B5450

0x0F7B6850
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
0xF44AA3AA
p190.jpg}
0x8B43AB8E

0x0F7B6850
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
0x26D2788B
her chair.  She began muttering,--
0xF1561E1D

0x0F7B6850
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
0xF698A6B6
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
0x3C1D7B48
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
0x4C834792
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
0xF0921814
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
0x4D466BF5
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
0x46933A17
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
0x7B34B8F7
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
0x7396726E
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
0x17031474

0x0F7B6850
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
0x193D2100
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
0xC813CC83
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
0x8A72675E
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
0x3211BD57
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
0x9B97ED0C
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
0x2BB73CB3

0x0F7B6850
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
0x2FE6F0F1
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
0xBB2AD1D2
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
0xA1039329
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
0x636132EE
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
0xA684A2E9
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
0xF1E95CC8
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
0xF2056340
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
0x727B50C8
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
0xF809D96A
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
0x078916DF
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
0xA1BDF43B
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
0x93EFDF05
dictates of conscience.'
0x090F1287

0x0F7B6850
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
0x572978C8
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
0xCE39E3BF
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
0xF231A34C
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
0x4C5FDD51
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
0x87AF2F68
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
0x7C5C0B38
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
0x429AF931
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
0x37A57E7F
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
0x5775D357
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
0x1FFD2DB0
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
0x40CFC839
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
0x535D31D7
me; the play is played out'."
0xC57D11B3

0x0F7B6850
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
0x0B747C62
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0x97FE530D
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0xAC4644AF
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
0x5E379D4E
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
0xEA1CFDAB
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
0xC35FEC7C
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
0x38B7FABC
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0x68DE847E
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
0xEDBCAF04
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0xC5A30ABF
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
0x2DCDD689
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
0x76C5B38B
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
0xEA38C786

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x14D40FC6

0x0F7B6850
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0xCF4CE338

0x0F7B6850
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0x9F08091B

0x0F7B6850
"Break it, sir."
0xE0096C2A

0x0F7B6850
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0xC8DAD655
disguise.
0xC44F7076

0x0F7B6850
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0xC88D9CC5

0x0F7B6850
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
0x267154BA

0x0F7B6850
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
0x2F6F1AAF

0x0F7B6850
"But not with you?"
0xF6845E11

0x0F7B6850
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0x4A18F1E1

0x0F7B6850
"What character did I act?  My own?"
0x7A44F5AE

0x0F7B6850
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x3856E096
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0xA38E83FE
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x103543FD

0x0F7B6850
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
0xFEE7D734

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0x58A3288A
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0xCC98D775
but it was not right."
0x5605E6D2

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0x7696434C

0x0F7B6850
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0xAFA66B39
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0xEC622310
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0xFFD0F6C7
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0xC80494DB
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x70C59FB6
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xEFD8E6D1
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xA8DDCD86
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x69D6236B

0x0F7B6850
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x916CC04A
signify?"
0xFB051818

0x0F7B6850
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0xD537A6AE
now, I suppose?"
0x25376B34

0x0F7B6850
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0xECE4A275
yonder are doing."
0x973F3CF1

0x0F7B6850
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0x9334251E

0x0F7B6850
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0x790F995C

0x0F7B6850
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0xA4204C38
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0x5F615CED
left this morning?"
0x4816ECAB

0x0F7B6850
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0xB2B3B6AA

0x0F7B6850
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0xDFD6A6C3
installing himself here till you returned."
0x9C264B18

0x0F7B6850
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x6B39AA2E

0x0F7B6850
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x191B99A4
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0xC8A7A626

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x12AF6E37
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x707FA551
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x2CB8E2F0

0x0F7B6850
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x94AEFCEA
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x2069EE71
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0xA97AF460
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x71E3D415
seemed to know what he was doing.
0xE53A20ED

0x0F7B6850
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0x13F1F156

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0xC1D8FBFB

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x3254AB7A

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x63AF600F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0x256AC1CA

0x0F7B6850
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0xA766E824
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0xA4B35BC5
and dreary look.
0x4DDA9713

0x0F7B6850
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0x06F72D52
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x4725968D

0x0F7B6850
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x28779B14

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x62FA6E88

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x26ACD552

0x0F7B6850
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x16A3B176
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0xCD66363A
doing."
0x7E39175B

0x0F7B6850
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x3DEDD9B8
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0xE882E1AB
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x7BBA5AC7
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x2E5D0151
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xEA8B3DC9
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x444B15CE
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xFDB0807B
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0x23563DDF
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x6CE7EDC3

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x2CBD0DAA
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0xB0096202

0x0F7B6850
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x45E76159
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0xF0621028

0x0F7B6850
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0x4CFC24BC

0x0F7B6850
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0xF30C134C
strange?"
0x96F9087D

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0xC7EB1286

0x0F7B6850
"And Mason?"
0x3C8787E3

0x0F7B6850
"He was laughing too."
0x4C8A0B9E

0x0F7B6850
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xF2E5A548
Jane?"
0x7C390F10

0x0F7B6850
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x1531F634

0x0F7B6850
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x31E1EF9D
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x86A7E0D5
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x6B77DB6F

0x0F7B6850
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x59B0FCED
you."
0x889FF9EF

0x0F7B6850
"To comfort me?"
0xDB789F89

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x2A1B23A5

0x0F7B6850
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x0103A04A

0x0F7B6850
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0xB2AB33F6
care nothing about it."
0x96E6D582

0x0F7B6850
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x5A4603CF

0x0F7B6850
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0xAA9DE29B
you, I am sure, do."
0x920444A9

0x0F7B6850
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0xC21B9E69
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x0295FCB5
and then leave me."
0xFDDE9F10

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xA84349B6
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0xF571A417
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0xCA93E17E

0x0F7B6850
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0xF80D6239
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x80EF9FF1
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x3AC5524B

0x0F7B6850
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0xEA3FD167
asleep.
0xDAC970FB

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XX
0xCFC6BED3

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0xE9C335B9
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x0234BAFE
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0x38F2358E
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x48FC9F66
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x04B0655A
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x478605FD
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0x140B07BA
the curtain.
0x39E3C56D

0x0F7B6850
Good God!  What a cry!
0x8075DFDB

0x0F7B6850
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0x9EE52201
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x6CE603ED

0x0F7B6850
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0xBF051322
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x1C5D1938
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x85EC3B71
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xA21F6D16
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0xAEB65C62
it could repeat the effort.
0xA955654B

0x0F7B6850
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xDE20F9C5
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0xB1C69F85
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x82F87E11
voice shouted--
0xE28733A3

0x0F7B6850
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x84A511EE

0x0F7B6850
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x65D6FA08
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x746CB411

0x0F7B6850
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xD2C2C0C7

0x0F7B6850
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0x2D347F20
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0xC07AED2A
was silence.
0xD6E9A083

0x0F7B6850
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0xFA641AA5
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0xD9CC2DFE
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x1FF703D5
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0xB9B1A81C
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0xF3D1DC16
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x698154D7
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x3FE89159
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x198A5074
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x6E79023A
confusion was inextricable.
0x9BB09DDC

0x0F7B6850
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x1A1B704B
in his bed."
0x56EC31E3

0x0F7B6850
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0x364CC389
coming."
0x5E305E24

0x0F7B6850
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0xFD3FA20B
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0x3E0717FE
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x6C396D0A

0x0F7B6850
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x7C29B6D5
worst at once!"
0xB29AD524

0x0F7B6850
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0xBBB43C68
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0x83ED0183
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xBF90B2A1

0x0F7B6850
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x9A53416E
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0xDE972E1C

0x0F7B6850
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xAB99C7C3
by an effort, he added--
0x9CB30D8B

0x0F7B6850
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0xD44ED28E
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x147916DF
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0xC94BDD39
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0xDD16B835
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0x77D84204
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0xCE6173EC
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0xC0503CDF
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x4F027D5C
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x62E7B6C7

0x0F7B6850
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0xBF0F441C
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0xD53E1848
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0xFD26F75A
had left it.
0x2AA6DB45

0x0F7B6850
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x24D96FCE
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x20BB9620
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0xD8BE42B4
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0xB690B838
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0x72DF329C
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0xEE5F6057
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x3D6E4E6D
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x17E26990
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x4F30B4E0
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x271D30E4

0x0F7B6850
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x025E5A4F
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0xA0AEE2C4
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x3638BD85
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x280B528C
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x4C090A72
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x1D8A9E80
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x2CA10C17

0x0F7B6850
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0xBFD32935

0x0F7B6850
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x0368F881

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And dressed?"
0x2ECEC68D

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x610D9428

0x0F7B6850
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x1C1E6557

0x0F7B6850
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x1B40AF9B
noise."
0x60834954

0x0F7B6850
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0xF97E34F3
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0xD423943E
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x186C7773
side.
0xC0A71C45

0x0F7B6850
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0x019C2F30

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0xD10D4B21

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Go back and fetch both."
0x66988360

0x0F7B6850
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0xA53C81BA
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x2FD557A0
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x1A8616CE
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xA562F9F6

0x0F7B6850
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0xF368086F

0x0F7B6850
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0xBCBFB6C9

0x0F7B6850
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x14CE2497

0x0F7B6850
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x0EDC2B8E
fit."
0x7FCF00CB

0x0F7B6850
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x4C82C6C1
the key and opened the door.
0x0B5E6376

0x0F7B6850
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x9881EC8C
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0xB2316580
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0xE916F967
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x8AA1F0A9
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x3C1ED054
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x42FE7BBF
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x5DED92F7
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x09A44D66
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0xCA323FBB
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0xC980633F
came out and closed the door behind him.
0xA388AABB

0x0F7B6850
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x52524987
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x7236D9BC
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x31CE87D4
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0xD7B1EF00
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0xD6ABB7F1
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0xAB7C8CEA
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x7C3A6E46
blood.
0xE0080DE2

0x0F7B6850
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x3B184C9A
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x69406C5A
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xCC6E2898
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0x490004F3
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x5F3278CA
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xDB7072D2
blood, trickling fast down.
0x27F3717F

0x0F7B6850
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x25A34067

0x0F7B6850
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xABE1B686
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0xEE1D0DFF
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xCB4B1292

0x0F7B6850
"Sir?"
0x522CD5EA

0x0F7B6850
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x99DED29B
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0xFA79FD1C
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0xCEB7F95D
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0xF3CB55FF
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x9162BA44
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x5BC06AD5
consequences."
0x61039A94

0x0F7B6850
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x5BE4610C
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0x28003D0A
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x1019F646
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0xF69DC2CF
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x918704C9
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0xC4EB24F6
step ceased to be heard.
0x1147270F

0x0F7B6850
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xFFA8FFEF
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0xF40D962B
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0xD41A12FD
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0xFBD7ED04
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x1CBA8635

0x0F7B6850
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x5A7362B0
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x4D982198
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xC467FF00
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x8B83D1A7
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0x1D511F61
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xCEC7B2A6
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x339E7EA5
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0xE1DECBD1
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0x4DEEFA20
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x2CF57730
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x03313928
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x9848DBBF

0x0F7B6850
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x1F8F0BEA
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x57702176
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0xED3A174A
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0xFE607E0D
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0xADCF3483
subordinate's form.
0x7FD32FD5

0x0F7B6850
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x855130B1
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0xFC271F11
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x0F4462A6
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0xD2BA3F39
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0xD54AEE9D

0x0F7B6850
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x3FD64EC3
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x243B5E46
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0xE1772826
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x31AA8A13
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x40552927
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xF1F69E09

0x0F7B6850
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xB65E4357
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x44138AED
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x96B985FF
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x86F2B141
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x9F23452A
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xBC2AF757
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0x68469CF2
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x87EAFE4C
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x0B8B291C
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xD2231BB4
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0xF9520D65
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x53713251
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0xA6E45F3E
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0xC5DDA788
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0x9A910390
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x92EF7E07
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x5446F9EE
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x2862DE6D
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0xD917008E

0x0F7B6850
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x5BA0597C
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0xF3C7339B
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x589EE381
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0x8B6C3E4C
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x2219FB2C

0x0F7B6850
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0xF5C4B09D
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x5298872E
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0xF9010048
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0x891C2037
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xE1646036
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x1BAA8053
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xA192D58A
I might not even speak to him.
0x3C764E2F

0x0F7B6850
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x58479948
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0x6EB33FF6
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x0B28D185
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x7A041CF9
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xE54EFC11
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0xA19EE4C8
shorter.
0x1C4E0F46

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0x32F6A0B2

0x0F7B6850
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0xC6AC1DEF
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0xD8CD602A
patient downstairs and all."
0x7F8348F3

0x0F7B6850
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x52D93E0B

0x0F7B6850
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x9403E542
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x10768EE3

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x29DE5B71
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x735DED57
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x717BC4E6
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x86267E99

0x0F7B6850
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0xFFF88620

0x0F7B6850
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0xCC69E367

0x0F7B6850
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x69AE0191
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0xA150BCD8
there's no danger."
0x4A59DA9B

0x0F7B6850
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0xAA705278
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xF7D84607
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x8503BF7C
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0xFF1E700C
here!"
0xC282A1FE

0x0F7B6850
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0xC2101C8B
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x907B6647

0x0F7B6850
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x4C0D49DD
said Mr. Rochester.
0x0E5CFA52

0x0F7B6850
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x5E598B22
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0xD3CE63AC
looked so quiet at first."
0xF62216D2

0x0F7B6850
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x56E71E18
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x2C03B17A
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x01209714
alone."
0x55155755

0x0F7B6850
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xB8F5FEDB

0x0F7B6850
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0xA414E515
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x59FA1849
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0x8CF03DC6
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xDE55FCCC

0x0F7B6850
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0xC7EE4B6E
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x9F0007A5

0x0F7B6850
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x39F75749

0x0F7B6850
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0xC88B5A62
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x946E317A
said--
0xD489085A

0x0F7B6850
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x6D821C9E
it."
0x4A5667E3

0x0F7B6850
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x874D66A6

0x0F7B6850
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0xD8754768
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0x9DCC1F8A
think of her at all."
0x65EAF297

0x0F7B6850
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xC34D298A

0x0F7B6850
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xD415846D
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0xC036C2B2
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x19893001
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0x89248690
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0xE1F7F09B
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0xE8E39FFD
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x0C418108

0x0F7B6850
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0xCBC48B34
and returned with them.
0xAE8BF3E7

0x0F7B6850
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0x780B0D0C
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0x3901C943

0x0F7B6850
I retired as directed.
0x2F8A22E7

0x0F7B6850
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x387F4278
Rochester presently.
0xD342674C

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x1DA8FD53

0x0F7B6850
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x0F7351D2
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x030A6C0E
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x2206E2A0
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xBDBCA7E2
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0xEFD08E18
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0x2898C134
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0xD70E4EB3

0x0F7B6850
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x2107A90D
edged with fur.
0xB564B103

0x0F7B6850
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xCD8B81EE
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x3D7146E7
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xBD4116BE
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0xAC63A84E
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xD14C2C99

0x0F7B6850
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x28E01079

0x0F7B6850
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x52EA29E8
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x90A3F67E
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x91293056
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0x172853A1
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0x12282633

0x0F7B6850
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x08C6ABF3
the washstand.
0x05E671F4

0x0F7B6850
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0xEA2A13AE

0x0F7B6850
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x4C8461AC
to Mason.
0x52FD6322

0x0F7B6850
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x0ED40C36

0x0F7B6850
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0x409790F0

0x0F7B6850
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x5260CDBC

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xCB6D9D62
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x617B3CCD
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0x8D6AA3AB
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x850BA90F

0x0F7B6850
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x6329E381

0x0F7B6850
The patient rose.
0xE0350F1C

0x0F7B6850
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0xAF52660B
step out--that's it!"
0x146D6AA1

0x0F7B6850
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0xB2011B47

0x0F7B6850
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0x8E849344
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0xDF4E8F8F
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x61FBD7AF
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x2D7525DB
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0xD6468879

0x0F7B6850
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0xE827C275
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x79E87C65
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x079B46D4
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x8D086D1C
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x4065D389
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xE6983160
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x9406C425
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x7D48E311
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0x8D59B5B3
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x94077775
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x43DA9D6E
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x42C0EEB5

0x0F7B6850
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0xC7FA6BC1
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0x7C7BC9E0
chaise; Carter followed.
0xDAC629ED

0x0F7B6850
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0xF5D335F6
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x4DA5FD6D
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x07418ADA

0x0F7B6850
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0x53AB0B6E

0x0F7B6850
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0xCED5DBCD
Dick."
0x40201E62

0x0F7B6850
"Fairfax--"
0xCA029829

0x0F7B6850
"Well what is it?"
0xF580270F

0x0F7B6850
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x1775C8D3
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xEA25462B

0x0F7B6850
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x99B867EC
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x19ACFB93

0x0F7B6850
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0xAC5E36C4
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0xDD58B141

0x0F7B6850
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0x76EF6F9B
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x6C0F7017
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0xB9DC7F08
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0xD49C2A3A

0x0F7B6850
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x4292B49B
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0xAE8C2828

0x0F7B6850
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0xB75CA04B

0x0F7B6850
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0xB706A0FD
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0x8DC64AD2
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x158DA39E
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0x721B5FF1
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x1B50F248
pure."
0x43DD0D84

0x0F7B6850
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x49C9F1AE
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x5ADEDE48
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x57A8D1DF
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x1A43C1D3
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0xE715BBF3
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x32A9FE82
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x2C349DB9
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0xD00FEFE7

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x3E5B3D92

0x0F7B6850
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0x26A7E460
me.
0x7F08C9A4

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you, sir."
0xF7BD5C28

0x0F7B6850
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0xD968B54B
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x5A5432BB
atmosphere?"
0x5579BD8D

0x0F7B6850
"I do, very much."
0x93803DFB

0x0F7B6850
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x6DFDA5C1

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x5870D982
with Mason?"
0x61519385

0x0F7B6850
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x8B7CF8F2

0x0F7B6850
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x62DBBBFF
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0xE6A0987D
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0xC843135D

0x0F7B6850
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0x022B68AD

0x0F7B6850
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
0xA572DF29
thoughts."
0x87DC50F1

0x0F7B6850
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0x8651AD50

0x0F7B6850
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0xD0537A99

0x0F7B6850
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0x14463118

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xB33A502F
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x0F2ED55B
spue fire any day."
0x56E27F6E

0x0F7B6850
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0x9AB5B191
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0x31EC1BC1
you."
0x889FF9EF

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0x0D7DFC7E
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x8815E1EF
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0xB820F847

0x0F7B6850
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0x96509557
how to avert the danger."
0x0825B5C3

0x0F7B6850
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x48E14F9B
from him.
0x9599A075

0x0F7B6850
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0xDC008610
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0x084BA9E2
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xA36B8795
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0x4B175FCA
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x1732430F
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0xF9115ABE
friend, are you not?"
0x5784A819

0x0F7B6850
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x2E4593E9

0x0F7B6850
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0xA9E86FB1
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0x1682FCCC
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0x7081CCB2
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0xEE94841B
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x5CF8DC14
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x2E8CE79A
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xF1F872FB
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x775BA45C
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x81EE877A
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x10F38754
me at once."
0x7E688D7A

0x0F7B6850
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x96718DBF
you are very safe."
0xC605342B

0x0F7B6850
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0xD89C3222

0x0F7B6850
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0xA2B25523
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0x9C3224B6
before him.
0xF06EF0CF

0x0F7B6850
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x1197181A
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0xBC0FABC1

0x0F7B6850
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x1A718B95

0x0F7B6850
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0xB3C4A9B8
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0x81CC462B
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x7C8E7619
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0xEAB6680E
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0xB4C20C14
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x0C7A918A

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir; I am content."
0xBFA9BC77

0x0F7B6850
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xD67EA518
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0xCD7C1CE5
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x57B99D84
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0xF4CBCA44
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x75BC6EEE
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x139F7936
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xFAAEFD41
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0xB71C88F6
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xD5CAEB61
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x47E61C10
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0xDEC63221
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0x568E8E9E
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x973F9F74
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x60EE36F1
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x258DCF42
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x23DF77AF
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x63411182
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x609B36E5
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0xF4E772F0
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0xB6276C80
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x18CA5502
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0x58C71AAF
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x4D4D048D
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0xB9784643
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0xDD66DBE2
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x2A97CE6C
judgment approves?"
0x5206DBD2

0x0F7B6850
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0x6860AC3D
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0xE71C7FAE
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x9D950E98
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x425A032F
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x6CA1B96D

0x0F7B6850
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0x1AD22DC2

0x0F7B6850
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0xF1AAD740
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x7CC5A8F4
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0xF2DB3D0C
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0x05B0592B

0x0F7B6850
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0xF7F1DA06
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x3931999C
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x3FF5F871
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x38FE379B
amend and solace to heal."
0x2F017567

0x0F7B6850
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x99D22DFD
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0xE1189B0E
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x8EFD76C6
instrument for my cure in--"
0x1B37C9E6

0x0F7B6850
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0x1A419F88
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0xB51925FD
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x8D988007
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0x5407BAB6
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x957E2D0F

0x0F7B6850
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x1B215283
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0x409273FC
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x6F6549FE
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xABB9DEAF

0x0F7B6850
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0xC656E9DE
came back he was humming a tune.
0x0CF226A2

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0xAAB3A9B2
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0xA55EDEF7

0x0F7B6850
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0xC9D15096

0x0F7B6850
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x526F6556
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xE0B6DEEA
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x6844618C

0x0F7B6850
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0xEB196B43

0x0F7B6850
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0x2AE65038
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x0E312785
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0xB69578E9

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0xCC9C4530

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x41FB92A6
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x27B839C9
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0xCD270973

0x0F7B6850
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0x2EB01E1D
cheerfully--
0x028E55FE

0x0F7B6850
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0x108FC3F7
I rose at four to see him off."
0x03F8EE27

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXI
0x6769668E

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x3B405099
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x24ED3FBD
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x4298A080
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x4809FF11
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x896713D9
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x518B836C
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x933304B3
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0xBDAF8BD2
man.
0x5D7BA27B

0x0F7B6850
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0x867F3F22
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0xDEE98367
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x8DCF71E8
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x285B23DC
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0x314630CE
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x0EFF98ED
little sister.
0xBE8EEFE0

0x0F7B6850
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xDB41988F
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xEF5CFE42
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0xE3004947
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xEE804627
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x85E4EECD
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0xD81E7C98
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x44F2078E
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x4E052970
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x9E17AF94

0x0F7B6850
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x2D2F190E
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x5824D14B
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0xC8C2620F
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x7F9878A2
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0xC6C7B51B
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xAC177D07
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0xD40C4DCF
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0xFB872944
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x72FFAD8D

0x0F7B6850
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xB24F50D8
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x4AF5524D
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0xA295986A

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0xFA7E56FC
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0xBDD518EB
are married to Bessie?"
0x33C3D887

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xC9B96692
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0xE5325A5C
child are thriving."
0xB8E04B84

0x0F7B6850
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0x43A5C06A

0x0F7B6850
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x1DC78DB9
badly at present--in great trouble."
0xCDF67D2A

0x0F7B6850
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0xE2FECF7C
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x094B4856

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xF442A451

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. John?"
0xB5A73F35

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x37A93A48

0x0F7B6850
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x25612A21
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x70F8EF2B
his death was shocking."
0x0F6D841E

0x0F7B6850
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x42045349

0x0F7B6850
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x04AA98AF
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x1FDD336A
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0xE8C9C25E
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x9983EEAE
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x6888416C
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0x281D43FD
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0xFEC6A8B5
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x02FF94CD
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x9921F8E6

0x0F7B6850
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0xF33FF59E

0x0F7B6850
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0xA54F38A8
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x1697FBBF
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x51A841BA
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x56854ED3
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x4D84B330
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x20043F27
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0xF3B8441E
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0x292D631B
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0xDF2E326A
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x8DB0C061
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0xF3B305EE
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0xBCE5D5F0
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x6C88FC04
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0x1C0A423A
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0x78998B3B
morning."
0x34D47950

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0x713AE7B0

0x0F7B6850
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x27C2536B
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x62C0AD93

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0xF94394AC
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x547BCCB5
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0x930B0825

0x0F7B6850
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x2F137417
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0xFA315B09
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x78F14EB1
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0x8526693F
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0xE6970081
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0xFE361FF8
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0xA892D3F0
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xDDC40E68
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x0D556868
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x07B6F019
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0xCA1C94E7
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xB78D0574
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0x482777CF
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xCC23F866
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xA6CB03EF
lineaments.
0x3B17B22F

0x0F7B6850
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x102C14B7
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x5E34F2DB
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xD446E0CC
cue and followed me from the room.
0x4C972D67

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0x0E55F8EA
which he had shut.
0x23272648

0x0F7B6850
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
0x42976542

0x0F7B6850
"What to do?--where to go?"
0x09E01A70

0x0F7B6850
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
0xD4AFF1A0

0x0F7B6850
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
0x540081E4

0x0F7B6850
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
0x0E701E0C

0x0F7B6850
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
0x0B393105
people to see her that distance?"
0xB1B17945

0x0F7B6850
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
0xC5C6B470

0x0F7B6850
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
0x16AAD7BC

0x0F7B6850
"It is his widow, sir."
0xC3254E2E

0x0F7B6850
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
0x2C16200C

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
0xC8666E0A

0x0F7B6850
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
0x50DD7617
had no relations."
0x6C073AE9

0x0F7B6850
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
0xBF5DD563
off."
0x7750D036

0x0F7B6850
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0x0F7B6850
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
0x52B09056

0x0F7B6850
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0xC896BDD5
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x676E6823
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0xBC5AB372
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
0xA05E353B
in London."
0x23B76975

0x0F7B6850
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
0x311D1D44
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
0x738D33EA
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
0xEAD8DAD9

0x0F7B6850
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
0xB7DC165D
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
0xBF32D5FA
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
0x8580053D

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
0xDAA4BEF5
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
0x00BAD906

0x0F7B6850
"How long will you stay?"
0xBABD4F89

0x0F7B6850
"As short a time as possible, sir."
0xA38050AD

0x0F7B6850
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
0xF0420DAE

0x0F7B6850
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
0x71939573

0x0F7B6850
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
0x5E913525
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
0x44A6F66E

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
0x04F413E3

0x0F7B6850
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
0x38EB0609

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
0x308ED13C

0x0F7B6850
"A person to be trusted?"
0xDAE000A8

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
0xED994171

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
0xA7703A44

0x0F7B6850
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
0x2C47432E

0x0F7B6850
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
0xFED49194
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
0x22275845
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
0x603AC416

0x0F7B6850
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0xF375DE73
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0xB52C2361
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0xCF5D0A15
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0xEFF94792
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0xF7D90B66

0x0F7B6850
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
0x629775E2

0x0F7B6850
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x6F6778C8
if recollecting something, he said--
0x433A757D

0x0F7B6850
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
0x731A7A50
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0x16749FA3
plenty?"
0x81070DFA

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
0x2EE4B54C

0x0F7B6850
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
0xA664C5AD

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
0x8937B3E1
while I have the opportunity."
0xFFC46641

0x0F7B6850
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
0x8E581999

0x0F7B6850
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
0xE9FFB982
married?"
0x7C1D50F4

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; what then?"
0x7AEC308F

0x0F7B6850
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0xDDA0DCA5
perceive the necessity of it."
0x344EABEF

0x0F7B6850
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x3D7DBD70
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0x1D4EB2F8
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
0x5709E328
straight to--the devil?"
0x9295DD0E

0x0F7B6850
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
0x087F2BAF

0x0F7B6850
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0x7C728439
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0x105AB83B

0x0F7B6850
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
0xB0F89EDE
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
0x2C8A31A7

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
0x29E6C8B8
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0x24C111C5

0x0F7B6850
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
0xDE58ECF0
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0xB6662F5C
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
0x6D2E32F7

0x0F7B6850
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0xE909FA58
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
0x30172FA9

0x0F7B6850
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
0x0B8ED620
five pounds, Jane."
0x90A9DB6B

0x0F7B6850
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
0xF0D97ECF

0x0F7B6850
"Just let me look at the cash."
0x7178F84B

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
0x95C99E22

0x0F7B6850
"Jane!"
0xC8CA591E

0x0F7B6850
"Sir?"
0x522CD5EA

0x0F7B6850
"Promise me one thing."
0x99893831

0x0F7B6850
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
0x7616C9E4

0x0F7B6850
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
0x5D4D567B
find you one in time."
0x0C26914B

0x0F7B6850
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
0xD4128268
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
0x0968C78B
it."
0x4A5667E3

0x0F7B6850
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
0xAF73EC24
then?"
0x289C9FB4

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir; early."
0xAC566BBC

0x0F7B6850
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
0xE21D42F3

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
0x38FD5E5A

0x0F7B6850
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
0xFC3E7A86

0x0F7B6850
"I suppose so, sir."
0xE0BA5D37

0x0F7B6850
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
0xFCFA0D21
not quite up to it."
0xC1626852

0x0F7B6850
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
0x39460F4B

0x0F7B6850
"Then say it."
0x4C4F8533

0x0F7B6850
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
0x743E16F2

0x0F7B6850
"What must I say?"
0x58EDA992

0x0F7B6850
"The same, if you like, sir."
0x52360C67

0x0F7B6850
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
0x3F96F49C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes?"
0x9E36A3B1

0x0F7B6850
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0x50DB9CC0
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0xA1DB8605
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
0x6FE6FCBE
than say Farewell, Jane?"
0x5694FC77

0x0F7B6850
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
0x1AD6026C
as in many."
0x2FA63596

0x0F7B6850
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
0x74EAECBB

0x0F7B6850
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x3BC177A3
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xB2A1F713
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x8A8A3144
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0x8C9DA6CB

0x0F7B6850
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0x3D8826EA
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x9ADDF426
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0xE53EE703
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xEA28B062
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0x04414C97
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x5DE624E8

0x0F7B6850
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0xA0B70471

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0x1EBFB79F
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0xF07B7D80

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0x29952645
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x207A7ECF
will finally recover."
0x02396E83

0x0F7B6850
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0xEA35AF0D

0x0F7B6850
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x0CDEEBCA
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0xDED12AF3
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0xD2CB858A
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0xC17E5272
and then I will go up with you?"
0x7FC809EC

0x0F7B6850
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x7323DC84
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0xBC589A2D
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x833BFC5F
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0xCACFDCCD
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0xE5EA7E15

0x0F7B6850
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0x997E02C2
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0xD6061933
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0xCE9285FC
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x3C6B0CC0
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xB3CB5F50
looks.
0x4CF6B310

0x0F7B6850
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x195DBEDB
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x1228E2C1
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x2AAC4D96
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0x0142666A
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x2E757C20
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x84623D07

0x0F7B6850
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0xB4A8D006
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0xDE6951C3
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x10BD80BF
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0xF5F86BDA
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x2481006F
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x055FEA58
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x26303DF8

0x0F7B6850
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x0001CC7C
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0xF6F90594
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0xDE84EED1
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x389D79DA
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x14625986
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0xCBBD18B2
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x2D9C96E7
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x5FC5CD8B
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0xF8151182
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x67B838D3
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0x28B772DC
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0xD6345CBF

0x0F7B6850
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x01DF2EAD
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x05443A82

0x0F7B6850
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x48AD1759
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xA10A3700
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x9E51E689
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x8F9D849C
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0xA8B132FF
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x70966026
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0xD64C285B
past recognition.
0x1CC856E5

0x0F7B6850
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0x73E570F5
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x4B31F7C1
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0x286EB327
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x7928C251
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0xB70D6C80
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xAB4964A0
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x69E94F8F
colourless visage.
0x3D27FE80

0x0F7B6850
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x0B36F8B4
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x2485C309
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0x9F933B6A
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x8026BD81
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0xF9FB9224
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0xE1982FD4
other's looked puritanical.
0xC5861C7F

0x0F7B6850
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0x42572EEE
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xEA32B5FC
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0x938F3685
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x645F84F5
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x21B3990D

0x0F7B6850
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x1DF71B89
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x830E57F2
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x5F3D1688
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0x49931AC4
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x897E9BBE
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x79E2F5C9
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0xF13E470E
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x85680BBE
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0x24F7FD7C
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x53CB9F5B
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xDCC09CE6
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0xCB096D95
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0x48E4E5BE

0x0F7B6850
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x2647AF74
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x5317DFAF
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0xC6AAADA9
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x844BD863
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0xB2CDD671
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x7B37489F
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x96FAA27F
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x583F4C5C
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x3AF91E45

0x0F7B6850
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x6EFE5020
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x16BCB674
liberty.
0x970A6D84

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x2339814F
can see her to-night."
0xEDF42331

0x0F7B6850
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0xEEB5B5DB
should be much obliged to you."
0x9801FB6D

0x0F7B6850
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x262A1783
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0xD28E0990
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x655340DD

0x0F7B6850
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xEDC764CA
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x74B426F5
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0x163CE4AE
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x2109A78B
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0x83C2DCA3
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x52E544C3
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x9996F3E9
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x23908D1D
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x3DE6A36D
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x142EAFBA
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x11C1892A
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x2ADC8ACF
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x32D89A74
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x9CE38C0B
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0xAB020B5B

0x0F7B6850
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x08170CA6
us see if she will know you."
0x96BB6A3C

0x0F7B6850
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0x8CE1491F
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0xD462AD78
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x6B12FE29
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0xF7701D7B
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x42262F01
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x174DC252
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0xF148C494
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0xD4DF6C3E
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x2425D7CD
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x2CA601FE
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0x761366B2

0x0F7B6850
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x5DBBA3C3
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0xC75C2C3A
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xFA09C54A
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0xDD42694D
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x89EBE6FE
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0x0BC47BD2
amity.
0x2A3E6E9B

0x0F7B6850
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x884051FE
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0xB11F3F2E
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0xBBA94369
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x9599D1E9
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0xCDCF91D2
she looked at me.
0xB5AFDC4D

0x0F7B6850
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x97D3C6C5

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0x9C7F7692

0x0F7B6850
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x9D5EDEA0
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xA17E6354
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0xAD50E4DD
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x5AC1377B
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x501FA35D
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0xB2C11C57
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0xD807BE3B
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x58CBC69C
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x9EAA2C6C
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0xC422E854
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0x380B72B6
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0x37187720

0x0F7B6850
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0x92DB3D0E
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0xC251F827
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x0EB28370
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x18D40CAA
the pillow.
0x25E52C61

0x0F7B6850
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0x72265246
till I see how you get on."
0x77A0564F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x2EADAA00

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xFE4F2D9A
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0xBDA97454
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x87F8E22D
say--let me see--"
0xDE89143E

0x0F7B6850
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x12280552
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x1828BF5F
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x4166B825
was at once irritated.
0xF1D44C93

0x0F7B6850
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x69E732CC
you Jane Eyre?"
0xAA906227

0x0F7B6850
"I am Jane Eyre."
0xE10F9BF4

0x0F7B6850
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0xC0A95232
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x118A39B6
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x8EF2A1E6
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xF0D62202
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x61E730FA
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x1AE3E359
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x5992A2EF
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x8A93648A
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0xA06CF498

0x0F7B6850
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x9873D1A8

0x0F7B6850
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0xB1DAFBD7
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x6B49B8EA
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0x4C9FA9BD
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x14327ACC
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x2308D857
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x45A30224
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x3A98A9A4
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x772E00B7
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0xB243FCE9
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x91D35BE9
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x706DCBAA
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0xDAD517EF
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x8D40DCA3
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0xDCE97816
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0x34D98F82
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xAF71C998
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0x04313EA6
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xD4A71190
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0x572C6AA6
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0xFEEEE96D
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x4A911273
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x57F59800
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xAA101D85
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x1EF092BF

0x0F7B6850
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x1E27DE30
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x0F000E4C

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0xEEEC5CF9
the morning she is calmer."
0x34EF08B6

0x0F7B6850
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0x133A84C4
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0xD39B2A44
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x683C85E6
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x60BD66AC
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0xDC0CFDD3
had?"
0x469B925C

0x0F7B6850
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x4F4C9BE7
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x5B2AD35B
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0x0B2B2E49

0x0F7B6850
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0xD2407D16
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0xA4E81DE9
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x28A483BC
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x2174AACD
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0x585A5CEE
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xDCBBA944
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x8E064395
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x9A1AEE11
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0xF62AA5CD
for both.
0x2CD56814

0x0F7B6850
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0x0B300ECF
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0xAE10CEAE
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x504D47A1
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x9E93BA35
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0x90B4509A
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x900E4E41
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x9A3F7FB7
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0xA257AC2C

0x0F7B6850
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x7FF80441
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x61796BE9
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x3B521B4B
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0x0A494F0F
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x8166856C
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x7E9B3618
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0xD64A31A5
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x2D20482B
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0x5864DE4D
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x80E959B0
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0xD35F9CD0
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0x3B1998B7
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0x61019F79
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x17E7F29C
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0xF57B2425
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0x81E2B945
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0xEB52314F
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x33F8207C
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0xB4332E0B
and content.
0x47E259E7

0x0F7B6850
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x528ACF72
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0xF6412E74
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x216A0559
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0x43D33029
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0xB218592F
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x692DB44B
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0xCDEB07D8
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xC7172487
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x8002DE92
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x40FCC0A9
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x7339ED5C
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xC2EF65FF
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0x3ABF0BE8
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x58DBA57E
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0x5CDE9661
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x1A516C58
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0x0D6D5A50
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xE3E595E7
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0xF58AC573
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x09928115
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0xDB5153F8
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0xE15E02BC
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xA5F2060D
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0xF584AB39
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x4D469E06

0x0F7B6850
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x09FAAAAB
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x9C4A106C
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0x02B9F77C
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x4562F5F0
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xECE380F0
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0xC69BA15B
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x86689B1C
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0xC5AF3AA3
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x3C69BC19
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x7DEE37CB
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0x65468301
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0xD7D956D3
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0xE462DDBF
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x87698494
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0xF24F8F7D
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x85A92927
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0xFD687E3C
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x85CAD131

0x0F7B6850
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0xBD9605B6
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x7F60849F
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0x2818F66B
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x6EC4C014
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x985F1941
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x1305D155
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0xA04B0A9C
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x741FA7B4
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x9FC8F7D1
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0xB9824185

0x0F7B6850
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0xF5C3F687
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0x6689411D
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0xA795EB1C

0x0F7B6850
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x5FCC26F0
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xBD4E1C5A
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x617684BE
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0xFC193411
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0xA69FAD9F
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xEAEE5FBE
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0xD5162571
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0x4AC14456
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0xA95CD18E
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x8FFBA8FB
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x1AAEFA73

0x0F7B6850
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x62DC3896
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0xF1FBCC15
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x441784DA
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0xBC0B721F
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0xA830070F
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0xAD06CBF0
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0xC5215D7F
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x1607EF42
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0x84E96CED
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0xD0C2A9FD
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xCB94451C
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x588CD725
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x7A065E71
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0xAB1DD69F
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x3FB49956
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0xAA3096D4
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0xB1E69190
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0xA578548A
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x3A863241
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0xE83F5214
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0x1AFAC2EA
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x86122D35
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0xA2ACD3BC
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x4ADCFA19
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x88ECF98A
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xE522FB4D
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x163D6D6E
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x56798EA4
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0x3493F1EC
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x763BFB69
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0xCCC3DCCB
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x1C583F59

0x0F7B6850
She closed her lips.
0x45BCFD18

0x0F7B6850
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0xAF528EB6
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0x48F7132A
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x89F42166
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0x4A13AEC1
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0xA1E8F97E
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0x11152DC8
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0xD3985FC0
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x205CFDE1
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0x4087E771

0x0F7B6850
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0x563F637D
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x847933AE
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xC400BCCF
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x4CC5BBEF
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x235E644D

0x0F7B6850
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x3B864AED
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x8A93F75D
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x3F6EC1C5
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x18765269
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x322DF5DD
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x936530DE

0x0F7B6850
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0x790B1824
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0x768DE21F
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x7ECA22B1
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x8C327776
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x325052AD
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0xC968FB69
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x3C1E283F
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0xFD99951E
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x01F30A29
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x400AC2BE

0x0F7B6850
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0x798C0628
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x5BAF6F12
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0x0F285276
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x2EAE5B57

0x0F7B6850
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x365AF9E9
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0x174C388E
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x018C4985
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x9F898EA9
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x335B5A38
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x96868FC6
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x786AFA2C

0x0F7B6850
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0xF9D2D49B
her.
0x55773EF8

0x0F7B6850
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x9958B2E6

0x0F7B6850
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x415C31CA
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0xDF51B7D3
me--where is Bessie?"
0xF06D8099

0x0F7B6850
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x0B0425BA

0x0F7B6850
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xDC88227D
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x2B85ABD5
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0xE5CD710D

0x0F7B6850
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xE7FDDC9C
identity.
0xD0D34214

0x0F7B6850
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x8C9B3E08
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x38EA02F8
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0xD9AC767D
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x3DF981D6
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0xC9A6ED4B
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0x311B1316

0x0F7B6850
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x143CABE0
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xFCFFD669
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x3C54ED2E
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0x7A42EB89
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x4E784857

0x0F7B6850
I assured her we were alone.
0x3603442B

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xDAA14099
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0x37A251A2
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0xD48BAE10
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x4D4283B3
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x6E5E8CAF

0x0F7B6850
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xD207467F
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x90E1C0DD
of the last pang.
0x0DAF6BF4

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x1DB70BAE
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x61977D4B
there."
0xF7B34945

0x0F7B6850
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0x2837DE88

0x0F7B6850
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xF51F4105

0x0F7B6850
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0xC996F4BC
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0xB99AB276
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0x71280E74
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0xFA47D7EB
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x3AC87F1E
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x399EF269

0x0F7B6850
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0xAA1A6302

0x0F7B6850
It was dated three years back.
0x130721BF

0x0F7B6850
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0xD5DF9AB9

0x0F7B6850
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0xE441CECE
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x02658ED7
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0xFF5C1987
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x88F94AF2
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x5C08B04D
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x61E4AE9E
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x8722D0C0
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x241DD386
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0xDE108604
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x6BF76117

0x0F7B6850
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0x67D1BA98
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0xD8F14FB5
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x1AD1BE2F
passed since that day."
0xC9E883CF

0x0F7B6850
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0x2879225A
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0xA67F1E1D

0x0F7B6850
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0xC6462B72
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0xC304C8F3
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x962E7417
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x17BFACB9
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x969F0629
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x089EFC3A
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0xB8B88193
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x1FE8F9F2

0x0F7B6850
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0x2C2726E2
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0xEA9C0F66

0x0F7B6850
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0xFE56FB35
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xFD268F02
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x6997B645
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x44537B52

0x0F7B6850
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x4C91F334
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x6221AC40
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0xFA5E6ADD
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0xD82D1441

0x0F7B6850
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0xDEF773E5
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x1542A98C
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x95F827A5
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x6A0F5581
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0xF4DC25E8

0x0F7B6850
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x98D77106
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x949B3BC0

0x0F7B6850
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x109E3430
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x979E359E
she must hate me still.
0x551311E1

0x0F7B6850
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0xA491206F
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xDAEB5C4D
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0xA772E592
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x1FD82DD4
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0x03FDFC3D
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0xD1E65EEE
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x623761FE
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0x97C718BE
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0x2DB04E3E
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0xF417AE12
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xAADEA809
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0xD53D2CF7
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x5D2960CF
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x62C01D81
form.
0x3A8D3676

0x0F7B6850
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x813682CA
observed--
0xA73E7FBF

0x0F7B6850
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0xCA525A4B
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0xEEEDC484
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x896893F2
Neither of us had dropt a tear.
0x377539AC

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXII
0xA9C05056

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x8D88E2D1
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x787A0DED
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x603CBEB4
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x6F9805E4
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x72C93829
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x3B61E493
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0xE1D435B9
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x75B3191A
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x1F742F70
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x1EDE1419
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x4B512ED5
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x6254041A
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0x90EEA6D0
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x5ABFFD44
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x3C459FAB
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x3613BDFA
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xEA7CA97C
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0xFFF10B7A
patient and compliant on my part."
0xE0761564

0x0F7B6850
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0xA3F7AAB8
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x471854F4
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0xBCB7A9E1
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0xA7B942AB
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x72B47711
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0x1162DB3C
notes of condolence.
0xAD99DB20

0x0F7B6850
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0x76756E02
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x60DDA26E
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xE1AE49D7
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0x97E24F5E
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x0740E89F
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0xA994F723
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x7FFDD0A4
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x4ACA4695
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x650FC1B7
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0x26A23097
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x921541CD
veil."
0x5DF64A72

0x0F7B6850
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0xAECF5818
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x594F3C3D
good may it do you!"
0x6F9DD891

0x0F7B6850
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x39C62195
you have some sense."
0x3A168B2E

0x0F7B6850
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0xE0E93F59
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x9F182690
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xA3741D1B
much care."
0xFECE61BB

0x0F7B6850
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0xC302595E
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x1366A82E
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0x6F3B0798
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x129402EF
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x1375FBE5
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x49CE5551
fortune.
0xFB1E813C

0x0F7B6850
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x8B2B8C7F
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0xF385F44F
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x870C1E78
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x4901E315
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0xB2721733
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0x58654448
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x8ACD17FB
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x9D5C7606
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0xB85F16C0

0x0F7B6850
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0xE1DDF05E
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x4D2FA4A1
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0xB153FFA7
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0xFE15E69C
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0xC9806214
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0xAC79DD91
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x36AEBE7F
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0xCDFC86FD
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0xD315798B
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0xFFF9E9ED
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0x0AFA66E3
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x40E9FB8D

0x0F7B6850
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xBE7B2128
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x70E2F3CB
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0x9243EFF6
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0xE92E500D
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0x0DDE5628
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x31431738
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xBAB43D79
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x9B3697DA
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x7EF63684
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x66659524
don't doubt it."
0x49C6CF86

0x0F7B6850
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x2591D452
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xA901C1FC
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xDA3CECA8
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xA1FBE056
both her and me.
0xB63C7016

0x0F7B6850
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xDA5C31C2
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0xA3E12936
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x7568951E
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0xEAD02E7B
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x1D1E3673
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x4432FB22

0x0F7B6850
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xBCFD1938
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x3D6FE3C8
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x32DE5793
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0xACA47B7E
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x219E27BC
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x0D84126E
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0x12AA2BBD

0x0F7B6850
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x3C766F9A
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x23DD5CE3
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0xD0A28339
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xC987B9A7
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0x57FB51D6
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x969169D3
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0xA05CEFA2

0x0F7B6850
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x92551D0F
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0xA0E83E48
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xF28BE227
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0xA258B7FB
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xE449BF77
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0xD40382AD
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0x7BA43662

0x0F7B6850
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x78382177
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0x51A90A57
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0xB70F16D5
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0xE83EBB39
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0xE582735A
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xAD95E35B
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0xD8D4A3F2
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0xE1CB864D

0x0F7B6850
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0xB2DB2961
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x3769DEC6
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x21BD38DF
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0x73B05BB0
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0x3260DC07
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x75AC7EBA

0x0F7B6850
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x6DF1E84A
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xB20E6948

0x0F7B6850
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0xCCBD6BB7
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x9B83AE79
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0x4AB7FCD6
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x1CE62714
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0xCA6164BC
behave with decent composure.
0x68999BFF

0x0F7B6850
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0x70215DB1
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0xB94B32BB
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x62F30CAA
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0x9F8503E3
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x54BAD5FF
month?"
0xFCC5F60C

0x0F7B6850
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x7FA3264E

0x0F7B6850
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0xC26EE8F6
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0xE8F24D15
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0xB418C7B6
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x24C567D3
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0x545024E7
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0xD95F275A
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x12EDEEC6

0x0F7B6850
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x8EE911FC
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x34E20E99
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0xEA3D6D1F
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x3098D3F5
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0xB8C18D4B
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x4F8B1CCA
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xC7D25689
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x5FEDF2CD
that it were my home!
0x19AFD414

0x0F7B6850
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x87B972B4
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xA9671952

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0x32E11F64

0x0F7B6850
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x7E62CADD

0x0F7B6850
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0x999EA42C

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x4C31360B

0x0F7B6850
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0xCDF3E146
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0xA07C5409
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x1188CC8B
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xEAA79EBB
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x21D3E56B
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x350B735E

0x0F7B6850
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x51EF026C
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x02114F22
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0xD4A1EEB1

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0xDA066FF1
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x6A7FE39A
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x3B3CC63E
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x67F1CDCC
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0x79EDBC3A
shed it over me now.
0xE1600B56

0x0F7B6850
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0x15755439
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0xCFC222E8

0x0F7B6850
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x6A09DBCA
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0x677146CB
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x5CFAF614
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xE8F58C6D

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0x489A33B2
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0xCFEBCBEF

0x0F7B6850
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x47ACFAFC
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x70B7C437
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0xB7B1F8AD
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x2B1771D2
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xD0AF25A1
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x04D0CD27

0x0F7B6850
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x3ED5A1ED
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x3FC2196C
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x42377D15
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0x4C695D61
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x3EF02768
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0x0B91AE7B
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x70E17354
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x7ED985BE
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x5B3D726D
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x5662620D
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x272726EC
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x55141D40
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x81CEC5A4
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x6B4BD0E1

0x0F7B6850
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0xE1F181B8
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x7AACBF73
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0x9A95505A
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x10CC76CE
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x1FF9907D
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0xC7FD8AB9
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0x1EFDC53E

0x0F7B6850
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x097F3407
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0xDF099016
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0xD24B4496
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0x96516554
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0xF82873B7
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0xE7DDC1D5
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0xBD3C61A6
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0xA3925366
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x341EBA28
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0x7D4EAE97
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0x75F9BCA9
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0x5191A3C7
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.
0x19892F84

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXIII
0x0FAA6349

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x65B7C46D
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x9F711655
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x45C74FE2
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x5F573DBF
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x6F6C20FA
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x92C1C96A
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0xF5D6CA9B
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0xEED259FA

0x0F7B6850
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x90EFA081
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0x160F9B59
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0x48E9109C

0x0F7B6850
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x07452E30
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0xEF719CC7
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x65DC0DF4
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x6A8BDC17
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0x18F0DFF8
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0xFCC1DE96
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0x8E50D476
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xCEDA41FC

0x0F7B6850
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0xFBFBA9E3
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x6250E06B
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0xFF8F5633
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x669FFE00
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0xB779439B
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x464425C7
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0xFF7617CA
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x12A38749
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0x0BC2E2A2
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x8058C5A1
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x496A82FE
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x20537D2E
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xB19ED211
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x869D78CB
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0x790F71FB

0x0F7B6850
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x1E868CB5
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x051496A8
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0x766C1A9F
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x61BE825F
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0xF03F80C5
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0xEA7DD0D8
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0xF6DFB26A
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x3736E38F
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0xE77F49B0

0x0F7B6850
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x3575FD0C
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xF17FE43B
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x0F6702D8
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xA8163FBA
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xCCCA430C
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x8199058B
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xF53F3BD4

0x0F7B6850
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x0C7D96D4
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x12717625

0x0F7B6850
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0x140771CC
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0x65C3E0A6
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x5C53E5E9
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0x01EDDF25
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x898F262A
turning--
0x945EC5A2

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0xAD5AEBF8

0x0F7B6850
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0xA7945316
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x5F2CEEFE

0x0F7B6850
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x2A9B093E
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0x3089C507
there! he is flown."
0x4C0F74D1

0x0F7B6850
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x2086641E
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0xC3FB2F74

0x0F7B6850
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0x7C02BC13
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x83D50923
moonrise."
0x3CE1C2B1

0x0F7B6850
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xBAF7115F
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x57645160
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x9827B88D
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x63BC4722
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0x9690BCD6
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x79467173
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x18F798BC
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x555C369B
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0xEA5A00D4
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x935676C1
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0xAA74B74A

0x0F7B6850
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x64507AB9
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0xB4CCADA0
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x1D293ABC

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0xEECC95FD
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xE4922BA5
Adhesiveness?"
0xEB3A0537

0x0F7B6850
"I am attached to it, indeed."
0x6FF11E96

0x0F7B6850
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x84716A74
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x21BAACA8
simple dame Fairfax?"
0xBBE272F2

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
0x018A8BBE

0x0F7B6850
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
0x1CC13DBA

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xF3DFBD02
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0xD82E20C0
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x2E623EAE
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
0x49E7F293

0x0F7B6850
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
0xE1A0FA93

0x0F7B6850
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0xCEF0855B
must."
0x47A11347

0x0F7B6850
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
0xCD3DEC2A

0x0F7B6850
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
0x21A8AF5E

0x0F7B6850
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
0x7EE2D0F1

0x0F7B6850
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
0x287D3A7C

0x0F7B6850
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
0xCC89738A
straight on the head."
0x174C584D

0x0F7B6850
"Soon, sir?"
0xD916FC1C

0x0F7B6850
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x771E1FFD
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xE2A6877D
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x77F41BCF
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0xA611C710
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0xF3B9B76A
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x52E5A33E
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x3B8BDF62
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0xB2174C9E
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x1FD54410
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0xFBAD706A
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0x27290DBA
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x4A948B7F
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x9781C6C7
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x08ECFD0E
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x7832251A
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x7F3D14D0
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x263131C7

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xBB153DEC
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x44B4E1F3
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x1EDD071D
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0x74D40CE5

0x0F7B6850
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xFF081D43
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x6B9F0A5F
for you."
0x2BBA3763

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
0xA0A4EB5F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0xD3ABD283
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x92DF682C
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x5B287416
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0xCA8EB141
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x56ACB689
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0x38318435
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0xD26C58F4

0x0F7B6850
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x8D146529

0x0F7B6850
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
0x4268C79A
distance."
0xA5366119

0x0F7B6850
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x61033193

0x0F7B6850
"From what, Jane?"
0x38AA27FE

0x0F7B6850
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0x4B0CD6FB

0x0F7B6850
"Well?"
0x9185C40A

0x0F7B6850
"From _you_, sir."
0xBCE6C910

0x0F7B6850
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x3CC91475
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0xD28FA63A
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x3116551D
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0x03E29967
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0xC51829DD
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0x1390EA36
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xCF13AAEE
loved.
0x7F4ED930

0x0F7B6850
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xB3A51BF9

0x0F7B6850
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x1BEBD11D
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x26AB7FC3
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x65EC24F9
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x955A007A

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0xE5F431EF
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0xC4383AF6
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x9D00B21A
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0x698B045C
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0x323FD4D6
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x17FC3490
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x05C4E003

0x0F7B6850
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0xE25530F6
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0xDA73AFF3
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x92A3A1DD

0x0F7B6850
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x08267AC8

0x0F7B6850
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x16F30DB7
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0xD93A9C86
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0x5A196991
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0xC46CD8DA
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0xE6F79CC0
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x6233B9E9
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x981C0A88
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0xF2936BC4

0x0F7B6850
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x6CB2B91B

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x6E912AA0

0x0F7B6850
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x1A71E251
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x461F1E52
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x4A24F671
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xC513234D

0x0F7B6850
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0xD84BC0D8

0x0F7B6850
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x5C61D920
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x6BBB4DD3
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x698C6E33
speak.
0x0E3F71A4

0x0F7B6850
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x18BA25DE
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x2100E6F0
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0xB278CFEB
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0xFB5CA0C8
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xF0C240D0
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x709CC282
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x50F1E15F
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0xB76E9C25
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0x8959452B
on the necessity of death."
0xC7849A1E

0x0F7B6850
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x03BFCB27

0x0F7B6850
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0x0DB7B17A

0x0F7B6850
"In what shape?"
0x9B29A8AF

0x0F7B6850
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x7A469911

0x0F7B6850
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0x6412358B

0x0F7B6850
"But you will have."
0x71FB517C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0x0086A566

0x0F7B6850
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0xFDA0D2D6

0x0F7B6850
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xAA50F387

0x0F7B6850
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x4730C056
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xE91711D1
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0xAE640C10
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0xF3D717C1
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0x577CE688
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x3F593229
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x1E3AFBA4
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0x619AAA7A
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x6348E0EC
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0xB51EAF8F
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0xDFA3DDB3
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x9FBA5A0A

0x0F7B6850
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x35246002
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x15D5AC65
Jane!"
0x876E4E3D

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x3442F67C
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xC3C4E0F7
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x0B6A3DAA
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x70BCFE82
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x2F1A273B

0x0F7B6850
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x976C7C6D

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x120208D9

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0xD22E178B
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x84534E28

0x0F7B6850
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x1A9458A6
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0x126EB9E7

0x0F7B6850
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0xFFE69038

0x0F7B6850
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x5681882D
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0x28A6AAE5

0x0F7B6850
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0x12319FDF

0x0F7B6850
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x82C12B2E
best earthly companion."
0x83C1E0D2

0x0F7B6850
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x34B48A24

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0x82E2A7D7
too."
0xA1211E37

0x0F7B6850
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0xEA378E3F
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0xA164B163
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x4BD14BC0
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xE47F55D0
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0xC8E11E9C
said--
0xD489085A

0x0F7B6850
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0xFF38468D

0x0F7B6850
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0xD9D14322
return."
0xE01B11B5

0x0F7B6850
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0xA7E3AA4C

0x0F7B6850
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0xED2E916D

0x0F7B6850
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0xEA4DA1DE

0x0F7B6850
"Your bride stands between us."
0xB3593CD6

0x0F7B6850
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x8B40659C

0x0F7B6850
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0xDB6CD225
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x7B38D5D9

0x0F7B6850
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x44AA5DFB
was still incredulous.
0x87B6E562

0x0F7B6850
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x206E2363

0x0F7B6850
"Entirely."
0xA68AE3FA

0x0F7B6850
"You have no faith in me?"
0x631BAB87

0x0F7B6850
"Not a whit."
0x8C87F03D

0x0F7B6850
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0x7D36097D
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x4EDF288E
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x745691CE
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x3D77D1C8
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x9A9B57F5
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x8C312A14
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0x81C47B90
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x5A41E3C1
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x5147BDB8

0x0F7B6850
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x5FA661FC
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0xF7133F2A
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x4AADC076
given me?"
0xEE3AA1B2

0x0F7B6850
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0xB8B9C56E
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x5AC00790

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0xA2187E61

0x0F7B6850
"Why?"
0x292FC4B9

0x0F7B6850
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x0716E668

0x0F7B6850
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0xB604307A
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0xE017B53B

0x0F7B6850
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x4485831F
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x0253DFF5

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x89E2F654
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xC94570A5

0x0F7B6850
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0xF8700D26
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0xDE55DF5D

0x0F7B6850
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0x154742DD
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x51FB0186

0x0F7B6850
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x8CA7D0B2
be your wife?"
0x491A459B

0x0F7B6850
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0xD79E73F8

0x0F7B6850
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0x3C35B0B9

0x0F7B6850
"Edward--my little wife!"
0xCD6206EB

0x0F7B6850
"Dear Edward!"
0x7FBE3A6E

0x0F7B6850
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x27023944
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x44A2B84A
happiness--I will make yours."
0x03212C3D

0x0F7B6850
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0xF95FC920
have her, and will hold her."
0x077CE40D

0x0F7B6850
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0xC1B737DC

0x0F7B6850
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0x7D2611CB
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0xD93DA29B
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0xBF2D89C9
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0xF43310EF
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x01409EED
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x174BB799
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xBEDF3158
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x2A57FDE6
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0x54AE3956
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x5AF21D89
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x131FB1FF

0x0F7B6850
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0xCD03FE24
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x1908AE02
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0xDD55144C
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x86B40CAC

0x0F7B6850
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x439F5B82
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x273AA3C4

0x0F7B6850
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x2F203B65
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x9CAC334F
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0x46479AD9
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x18833D4D

0x0F7B6850
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0x3BD00D31
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0xC9FB2EA5
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0xCC904AAC
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x3B52DE5B
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x35AD73A0
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xDF6FDAB4

0x0F7B6850
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x95F1290A
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x8BFA17F5

0x0F7B6850
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0xDF861217
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x52E26D7F
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x80C6CB1F
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x7BF20243
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0xD81F775E
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x5D840E9A
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xC02F1A63
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0xB935035B
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x0EDD30FA
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x3CB03251
strength for anything.
0xF9A31703

0x0F7B6850
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0xAE3891D3
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0xB0A17C8F
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.

CHAPTER XXIV
0x8A9D7850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0xE8603811
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0x3E20F353
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0xBEF418AE

0x0F7B6850
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x15F1C251
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x7BE04040
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0xDB8194E6
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xDDD7F397
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x8CB1B87A
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0xA743D1F9
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0x13AB89FA
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x7F192FD8
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xEAD538D6

0x0F7B6850
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x34E79AB9
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x04E23B3B
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x26CE18B1
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0xEB13DBED
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x989F9FA8
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xBABB4A55
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0xCE0E79D4
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0x615C09ED
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x8676763F

0x0F7B6850
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x130FA0DB
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x8AFFD718
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0x42807F00
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x9587AC54
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0xC5C16C4C
schoolroom.
0xD75C7937

0x0F7B6850
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x83417335

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x779A1DD5

0x0F7B6850
"Where is he?"
0xA9B48A7A

0x0F7B6850
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x465DC2B3
there he stood.
0x699FCA9F

0x0F7B6850
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xC3AB329F
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0xDE4DD9F7
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x267518F0
well loved, so caressed by him.
0x0FD96975

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0xF0C470F1
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x5AD7D0AC
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x1889A350
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0x38DBDF8E
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0xCD05823E
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x554B7BD1

0x0F7B6850
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x0B866195

0x0F7B6850
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x4D2B9DE5
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x6318EA2E

0x0F7B6850
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x50184591
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x5085DDB0
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0x50ED8AF8
think almost fear.
0x050F64EA

0x0F7B6850
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0xD7B46EA5

0x0F7B6850
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x8F43B3B0
strange."
0xC6BDB37F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x75C5580E
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xF20CA846

0x0F7B6850
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xBD490585
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0x18AF0C9F
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0x4BDCC54F
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x3C1FB81C

0x0F7B6850
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0xEA73F65B
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x013B320B
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0xD31C639C
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x2AE93CC4
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0xCAFF1611

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x2BF8FDE1
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x0939EDA4
have them."
0xBB8C21DC

0x0F7B6850
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0x70693E0C
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0x7E403D52
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0xE2DA1B30
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0xE04174C4

0x0F7B6850
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0xB389BFCD
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0xA912A2E1
Quakerish governess."
0xFE556ECD

0x0F7B6850
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xBC3FFB21
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x5873E259

0x0F7B6850
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x2DD66CC5
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0xC974B827

0x0F7B6850
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0x0E64F96F
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0xD9DA2687
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0x2C3BEA54
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0xAC20CAAD
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0xE02D4517

0x0F7B6850
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x9214A95D
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0xACAE41BD
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x7E59910E
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x24D6969B
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x5C7FF8CF
flatter me."
0x0DB50AC6

0x0F7B6850
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0xACFC0BBC
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0x2CC63F25
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x327CDCB6
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x431DC523
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0xBE5A7C63
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0x223DFFEC
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x17F92343
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x6679B8C4
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x5B4CC723

0x0F7B6850
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x85A5090A

0x0F7B6850
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0xAAFC8B2B
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0xACF1AC31
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0xDBB645FA
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x65E626E2
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0xF1CDE6C0
as my comforter."
0x4A1318DB

0x0F7B6850
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xF1F85C7C
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xE87F10F0
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0xA6ABB906
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0xAEFEE525
anticipate."
0x6282E00F

0x0F7B6850
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0x83A8B06F

0x0F7B6850
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x1BDCD323
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0xE9EEC667
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x227A9CEB
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x148AB643
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x72340D14
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x81BC57EA
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x3D9918A8
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0xF073047E
dear master."
0x167B89C5

0x0F7B6850
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x9C44AAA0
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x5EF79CA7
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0x230106FF

0x0F7B6850
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
0xB1188653

0x0F7B6850
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x5D0162B1
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0xB91961F6
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x498ACA8F
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x5C9AF988
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x82C026F2
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x15B756DE

0x0F7B6850
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0x4DF165D8
such an one?"
0x23B6E5CA

0x0F7B6850
"I love it now."
0x0A7D1AF8

0x0F7B6850
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x837B6122
standard?"
0xC6B872A7

0x0F7B6850
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0x8DF6EEDD
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0x835D349D
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x59A66CF1
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x218E483D
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x739010EF
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x0B7A4396
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0xD1AE6B14

0x0F7B6850
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0xFF9C0C9B
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x73798A6D

0x0F7B6850
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xA70FEB66

0x0F7B6850
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0x77D73598
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0xD707A6A0
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x511A42B0
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x0B724803
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x500B036D
pleasure to grant."
0x0E2386BA

0x0F7B6850
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x3F53AF6C

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0x1B872C41

0x0F7B6850
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x2BF52E46
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0xB5B2AF2B

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x1869736C
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0xECF75376
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x414A29B6

0x0F7B6850
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0x5B5062D1
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0xC90A907D
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0xEE5DCA6A
withdrawn: try again."
0x52488CD0

0x0F7B6850
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x3740BBE9
piqued on one point."
0x89EDF321

0x0F7B6850
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x13C60357
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0xE2AC704C
request--"
0xB9A6E8A6

0x0F7B6850
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0xCE736296

0x0F7B6850
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0x08BD4AA3
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x745F2F01

0x0F7B6850
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0x36B69737
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x94E1FBC6
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0x56061204
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0x397303DA

0x0F7B6850
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0xAB9E975E
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0xCB4480F2
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x0AEB0661

0x0F7B6850
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0x03496D57
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0x592753D5
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0xBAE06A59
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0x6DA9FF39
of my power?"
0x32433DA5

0x0F7B6850
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0xF7A62412
up."
0x4FED351A

0x0F7B6850
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0xBC418812
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0x4514B8E2
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0x768B364A
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x79790BC3

0x0F7B6850
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x969EFE98
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x04C342EB
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0xDDF38DFB

0x0F7B6850
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xD9485551
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x52F3AEA6
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xA17A2E30
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x3E6D8356

0x0F7B6850
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x9C823F10
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x0E22FCC7
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x8CE7F2CE
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x93F70A16
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x50731AAB
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x0004261B
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0xF3F2028D
made me the offer."
0x5315E424

0x0F7B6850
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x2AD37E46

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x2BAED8DA
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0xA5FBE645
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0x55CFC8D9

0x0F7B6850
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x1DAA5C84
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x513B6365
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0xA859C6AC

0x0F7B6850
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xA9CD788F
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0xCA22D0C2

0x0F7B6850
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x5F54DECF
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x9C55B91F
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0xADA6AEAF
deserted?"
0xC8CC464D

0x0F7B6850
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x304B6804
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0xE097A7A0
moment."
0xA80A3EBC

0x0F7B6850
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0x0A21F9A0
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x2222C935

0x0F7B6850
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0x19DB2913
awry for want of attention."
0xDBFC18CA

0x0F7B6850
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x99FA5088
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x28D807C6
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x5D1B96CB

0x0F7B6850
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0xFAE54F19
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x57EECCA0
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0x41AA13CA

0x0F7B6850
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x4AB5A212
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x5F9485FC
express.
0xD8A92097

0x0F7B6850
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x5D010C0A
entreated, and to yield."
0xDAA69441

0x0F7B6850
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0xA74246D9
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x0DABE88F
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x789A2CBD
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x906B42AD

0x0F7B6850
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x1024173F
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0xAFDB3475
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0xCD153412
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x5B0C1788

0x0F7B6850
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0xD6FBD21E

0x0F7B6850
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x692E1D9B
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xA56F761C

0x0F7B6850
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x92C15534
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xA97DCEDE
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0xD59622D1
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0x676808C4
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x646DE3E7
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x9ED1224C
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0xB47B3D06
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x60CA5C5E
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x8A22BA51
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0x0A658FCC

0x0F7B6850
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0xA7BDDF4F
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x73739A0E
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x9A7F22F7
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0xC26013B4
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0xA52C4C54
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xF9B4EE20
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xD73655F4
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x15A4860E
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0xD7569B9C
you would be his wife."
0x481E131E

0x0F7B6850
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x9324DA6F

0x0F7B6850
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0xF8DEC98C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x16746C5C
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0xF5A8819A
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x96B9FFAA

0x0F7B6850
"He tells me so."
0x8E1742B7

0x0F7B6850
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x245FCC8F
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0xE3DC77C5

0x0F7B6850
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0xF4F6269F
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x8ED1D5BF
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0xF580AFA2
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x5E3497F6
father."
0x12EBD19F

0x0F7B6850
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x8CA379F1
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0xEECA7D31
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x7A5933DD
twenty."
0x2C49487C

0x0F7B6850
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0xB6B966E6

0x0F7B6850
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0xF549020F
eyes.
0xB5374E9A

0x0F7B6850
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x18BC3812
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x122152E5
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x86464BB7
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0x68FC1505
I expect."
0xEF8895D2

0x0F7B6850
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0xDE8C6970
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x6CB0D3D9

0x0F7B6850
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x720741B5
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0xEBA90287
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0x93BFD502
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x5A4B4022
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x7AC78AF6
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0xCF6F3E67
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x6314292D
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x77C237ED
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x0E246835
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0xB51335C2
him."
0x1F31C36A

0x0F7B6850
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0xA80814F6
that all was right."
0x632AE92E

0x0F7B6850
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0x7BCCB492
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0xC8ED9B63
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0x16C0B1BF
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0x1162AAB4

0x0F7B6850
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0x9816C1C7

0x0F7B6850
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0x57FD794B
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xCA8F84B4
me go mademoiselle."
0xB63ADC14

0x0F7B6850
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0xDF8939A1
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x6C251234
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0xCD1BE4BB
backwards and forwards.
0xF55E0F59

0x0F7B6850
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0xE94697B8

0x0F7B6850
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0x272892A9

0x0F7B6850
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0xF5A37598

0x0F7B6850
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0x4DB8AFF6

0x0F7B6850
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x44FD1B7E
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x96C7959D
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x8A596F33
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0xBF88C29B
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x238FEEAB
my face.
0x2CBBD894

0x0F7B6850
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x9A696C96
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0x9A3CE601

0x0F7B6850
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x375A1872

0x0F7B6850
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x29F15011
to Adele.
0xF13701E0

0x0F7B6850
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x7782FE09

0x0F7B6850
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x7B5826FA
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0xF557A6D5
company--for life."
0x765673FB

0x0F7B6850
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0x216EAD9F
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x689A84E7
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x013D1FEB
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x32521D76
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0xB8D377ED

0x0F7B6850
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x2DB3EC80
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x81C70B45

0x0F7B6850
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0x2E5C0C8A
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xBBF0D400

0x0F7B6850
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0xB0D508EA
mademoiselle?"
0x01EE5E29

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xBC795BDB
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x5B86FAE3
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0xE3B6D127
there, and only me."
0x4029C941

0x0F7B6850
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xBBC7A59C

0x0F7B6850
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0xA9AC5899
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x50202ADF

0x0F7B6850
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0xD68FE2BD

0x0F7B6850
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x3E791B66
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0x78B7F37C

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x001F3493
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0x189424D7

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x7D4D3CE9
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x65BAC8E6
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0xB0B828CC
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0xA1AD812C

0x0F7B6850
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xAA28C4B1
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0x2A713A9D
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0xDE4D3462

0x0F7B6850
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x3435D5BA

0x0F7B6850
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x20AF8613
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0xC0392E33

0x0F7B6850
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x886C1F44
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xE6B3D3D0
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x104BCFFE
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x60C83B8C

0x0F7B6850
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xCF93E4C4
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0xDE227035
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x554C6399
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0xE6081DA9
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0xB5290A0B
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0xF28DD4A0
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x6FC25AFB
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0xB8BC9E99
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0xCA4CAAAA
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xB5B4F0BD
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x9EA70D1B
effect--
0x2E1FF399

0x0F7B6850
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0x65D07400
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xBD0A1535
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x6B4DD709
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x1BD98978
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0xE9A18E27
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x7B41B457

0x0F7B6850
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x7560B6F7
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x4AC9FCDA
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x1C3C329B
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xFDC5485C
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x1219E748
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x0C12B4B6
again."
0x5C04D898

0x0F7B6850
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x4E11DCB0
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0xF3BFBF78

0x0F7B6850
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0xFC8785F7
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0xEE1240A8
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x064724D9
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x7D303151
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0xF94D574E
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x9749FC14
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x01F90382

0x0F7B6850
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0xE0E4417F
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x758ACD0C
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x0240216F
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x99FEB792
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x03E83178
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0x11E47AD5
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x2F9B8D75
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x17CC9A5F
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0xEB81700A
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0xCF88140D
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x07B6AC29
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x87887E2F
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x1F474FA4
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0x3F383769

0x0F7B6850
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0x53C0E73D
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0x9C925B28
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0x6CA8EC2C
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xBCD9EF02
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xE23DACCE
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0x27FC1A02
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0xF644BD71
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0xD7A46962
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x7A89E295
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0xA3496DA8
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0xB42EB110
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0xFCE2FEDE
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0xD71E670D
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x0376A18E
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0xC652BC0F
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0xCBBD25AB
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0xB27EDC3A
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0xB4B029BE
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0xD23BA6DD
passionate pressure.
0x57C451BF

0x0F7B6850
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x23A4F66E
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0xFEF7DE21
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x408A6FF0
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x4E2FC54B
satin."
0xC6F8D74E

0x0F7B6850
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x465AE193
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x30A025B4
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x599E89DA
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x0BFEBDE6

0x0F7B6850
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0xAE912915
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x45EA685D
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0xCEDC510C
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x1E6E55C8
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0x3764C42A
satisfactorily here."
0xD191E0F4

0x0F7B6850
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xFEA19C94
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0xA196F20C

0x0F7B6850
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x60362A0B
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0xECF1F765
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0xEB863AF7
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0xC79A5977
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0x242099AE
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0xD53515B1

0x0F7B6850
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
0x516B49E7

0x0F7B6850
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0xFCE97880
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x88831EA9
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0xAAF2F4D7
would be to violate its conditions."
0x63474F9E

0x0F7B6850
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0xE15D2E60
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0x4BC52F02
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
0x95ED4E7A

0x0F7B6850
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
0x409CA6F9
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
0x11FA2464
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
0xBCA35444
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
0xA20882A2
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
0x46B72507
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
0xBB2D076F

0x0F7B6850
"Well, but what?"
0x99973108

0x0F7B6850
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
0x8CCF94C6

0x0F7B6850
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x61561772
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x02759FBB
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0x17204F75

0x0F7B6850
"No, thank you, sir."
0x7274D2E0

0x0F7B6850
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
0x29B06FF2

0x0F7B6850
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
0xA9FC8012
till--"
0xBE74C0EC

0x0F7B6850
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
0x8C2538AB

0x0F7B6850
"Till I can't help it."
0xBF69F865

0x0F7B6850
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
0x14547B0E
companion of my repast?"
0x9480782C

0x0F7B6850
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0x48090318
usual for another month."
0x7C37A89B

0x0F7B6850
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
0xF443A61B

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
0x304E2DFC
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x9F12BF2D
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0x94A0DAB4
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0xD0D86414

0x0F7B6850
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x39A3C2D4
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0xB8AA783A
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0xBE1FADF1
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0x1AACA1D3
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x27D6B5E4
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x882A4069
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x21F18DF2
my jewel I should tyne."
0x43BDE1CB

0x0F7B6850
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0xC11D4FB7
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x0A40EF38
retreat upstairs.
0x9A5887AD

0x0F7B6850
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x71D5DB72
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xEC0A034C
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0xB7733EE4
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0xE0735D2D
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0xC5B5E078
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x6AC70C9A
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0xF6E351E5
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x03EC4781
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x7B5202BF
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x1DA75748
the present.
0xB565A5D9

0x0F7B6850
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x03AC5DFD

0x0F7B6850
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x8FB4C867
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0x395B3FEE
stimulate it.
0x82F5CDC3

0x0F7B6850
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x839A876C

0x0F7B6850
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x85665D05

0x0F7B6850
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x24A44218
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0x0C27E692
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x34F2D32F
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x9BA1B23A
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x09CC4A99
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x231E53E5
strain:--
0x28E17544

0x0F7B6850
   "The truest love that ever heart
0x37E55CE1
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x6DC790E6
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0x0C279C15
      The tide of being pour.
0xDF73826A

0x0F7B6850
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0xA05960A7
      Her parting was my pain;
0x32527081
   The chance that did her steps delay
0x75225C41
      Was ice in every vein.
0x556C3591

0x0F7B6850
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x85494231
      As I loved, loved to be;
0xBBF689BF
   And to this object did I press
0x7BEC5006
      As blind as eagerly.
0x7ECC0BCE

0x0F7B6850
   But wide as pathless was the space
0x02C9F383
      That lay our lives between,
0x4F06C6E9
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0xB00A15FC
      Of ocean-surges green.
0x6E707968

0x0F7B6850
   And haunted as a robber-path
0xC8D86AED
      Through wilderness or wood;
0xDED714ED
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x58106B29
      Between our spirits stood.
0x71C2CD4B

0x0F7B6850
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x56314F0C
      I omens did defy:
0xC06EC712
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0xC9BFDCF3
      I passed impetuous by.
0x8647F99C

0x0F7B6850
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x7C2BE73C
      I flew as in a dream;
0x11DDCBEE
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0xC0399129
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0xEB1FF3C5

0x0F7B6850
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xE43177E7
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0xDDD0B9E0
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xC2583D3E
      Disasters gather nigh.
0xCD142576

0x0F7B6850
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x30CD17E3
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x75237ABC
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0x6F6543E2
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0xB01678F1

0x0F7B6850
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x20A96507
      Right, bar approach to me,
0x2C37DE11
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x7D66A812
      Swear endless enmity.
0x69FA37F1

0x0F7B6850
   My love has placed her little hand
0xDBBDC666
      With noble faith in mine,
0xB6B4AC0E
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0xA39F4E42
      Our nature shall entwine.
0xE0F1C83D

0x0F7B6850
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0xAE5E17F0
      With me to live--to die;
0x7A0FF712
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0x1639ED9C
      As I love--loved am I!"
0xA306C708

0x0F7B6850
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xD25B1A18
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x7636255C
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0xDE28DA72
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x02A6D137
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x90D0CD07
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xF9B8B94F

0x0F7B6850
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0xD9B9BB52

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x23343229
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0xE8341362
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0xD354A39D

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x6160CBC4
Death was not for such as I."
0x31EDAF29

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0xDB39D8B1
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x37AC45B5

0x0F7B6850
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0xB806D60C
reconciling kiss?"
0xD1CF73F0

0x0F7B6850
"No: I would rather be excused."
0xDA6D9AA0

0x0F7B6850
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x4C48740C
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x6DB1081B
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x72991B2A

0x0F7B6850
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x98A405CC
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x29EE7E22
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0xA3BB5661
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0x15F30B72
time to rescind it.
0x79C4E905

0x0F7B6850
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x504AC573

0x0F7B6850
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x1E046FB0
myself I was doing that now."
0x10119860

0x0F7B6850
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0xD511E0F5
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0x139718C8
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x5F1A58E9
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0x00587370
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x9F01D869
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x094C8524
advantage."
0xFA30AD53

0x0F7B6850
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xB97258A8
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0xBFAA7838
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x1372D02F
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x8F30BB90

0x0F7B6850
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0x64BD9D41
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xE140A43F
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0xD745E0E7
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x24B52AE7
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x61DC344A
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x22D5337F

0x0F7B6850
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xE83C8F9F
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x16582BB3
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0x8E7F86F3
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x978227F4
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x84877416
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x8EF60F6B
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x62F70E2B
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0xDDF1BA1A
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x0D7D1844
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0x56BDAEDB
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x98E8C16B
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0x96471306
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0xFBC39795
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x3DD1A9F8
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x8DC43464
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0xC4247A9D
virtue, another must be devised."
0xEF31CEDF

0x0F7B6850
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xE35E7003
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0xBA784F54
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0x0FB80851
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x169C53BE
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x2CCE6445
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.
0x31A6262A

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXV
0x4FFA7ECE

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0xA8CE4E81
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x25B60035
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x917EACDF
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0xDE8EE2C2
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0x30A161E7
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x6114B5CA
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0x2A475B28
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x14DB1303
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x9F73B521
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x75C4DCE7
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x507232F0
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x8F9C0347
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x25CFF4F3
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x56CDE713
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0xCBA92A1C
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xB2D6206A
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0xD4BC3BCB
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x2BA4170F
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x96D5C0E0
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0xCEF06C28
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x3A76CD98
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0xAEBE23BC
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x11A86FC5

0x0F7B6850
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0xB52E4492
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0xB0F63020
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0xF2FAB6F1
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0xA02DFFB5
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x78EC436F
more than they.
0x7B772E2E

0x0F7B6850
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x821C6D30
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x939D9D2C
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x9F54A117
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0x0D463D5A
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0x2021A580
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0xBD4011D6
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0xDC7473DC
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0xA484135E
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0x1ED8E75F
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0xC81E1892

0x0F7B6850
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xBEB26027
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x4B618279
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x6F31DFD0
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x65B24992
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0x0C9AF00D
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x5E007C47
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x6D6EE671
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x2EAA9804

0x0F7B6850
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x70D034F9
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x0C067523
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x78173176
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0xEF06DB12
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x80A4CBCB
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xB10FAE48
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0xD1451352
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x27BF0C81
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x1231B9F5
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0xEEBDEA9F

0x0F7B6850
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x872F8BC6
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x9F79F7F4
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x3C7E6D20
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x340F8B00
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0xEE268E74
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0xBD523107
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0xF6F89BCE
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x87449BA4
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0xE3B26463
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0xDC9F8D95
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0xEE22E745
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x89557A07
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x4C2C0922
listen to, and I ran off again.
0xE61BE3B4

0x0F7B6850
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x946D024F
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x4DE3592C
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0xAE050A42
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0x1674B52F
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0xF69B6B07
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0xCB292093
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0xD0F79E5C
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0x8EB3995C
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0xC3D37800
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0xF836C175
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0xCF4EEF3D
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0xDC97C19D
simultaneously struck ten.
0xA1B01B4A

0x0F7B6850
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x74C6E2ED
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0xA64EB258
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x560C1FA3

0x0F7B6850
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0xD5650EE0
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0x4C3B7331
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0x4A259767
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0x78B8ACFF
by one moving speck.
0x367E1EB4

0x0F7B6850
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0x64FDAD1E
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0xD05C8989
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x16F9DF54
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x979BAB0E

0x0F7B6850
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x217A27A9
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0xD21E8463
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x4D526BFC
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x35B15C7D
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x3FC19829
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0xAFEDC4AE
meridian, and must now decline.
0x24C5E876

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x4781B424
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0x29E19EC0
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xE64E1DD7

0x0F7B6850
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0xA5B36ED7
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0x2202427C
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0xF1620948
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0xEB798068
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0xE5A01125
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x14E25628

0x0F7B6850
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xEE5C35B4
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x2B4EA184
give me both hands: mount!"
0x445F296C

0x0F7B6850
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x535C0215
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x96504414
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0xD5580F14
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0xC837BDA9
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0xFA9EC22F

0x0F7B6850
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xE23FA820
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0xF93996B8

0x0F7B6850
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0xF9B50ACA
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x6EABDFE0
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0xE81205C7

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xC02910CC

0x0F7B6850
"Then you have been both?"
0x4B4A459F

0x0F7B6850
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x9570ABE5
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0xD6EE9166

0x0F7B6850
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x07623885
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0x0A8EB35A
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x06A1BE03
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xBA7CC1FE
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xCA72C69C
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x9FC72AE8

0x0F7B6850
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xC66604EC
get down."
0x9F1DF2E6

0x0F7B6850
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0xE3C6D86C
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x5F948BBD
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xD75D0152
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x95D29B38
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0xABABA3D6

0x0F7B6850
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x21BBC2E6
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x39F121AA

0x0F7B6850
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0x4463B069
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xD14EE380
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0x32D851F6

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0xC5A6057A
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0x87936EC0

0x0F7B6850
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x3FE4B043

0x0F7B6850
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0xD8CB4E36

0x0F7B6850
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0xC3827310
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x33F4EFFF
as a long, strong arm.
0x02E39548

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xC4FE0B32
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0xD59EF737

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Jane."
0x92868052

0x0F7B6850
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x120E40C1
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0xBD2F1B0F

0x0F7B6850
"It is near midnight," I said.
0xAB348CD8

0x0F7B6850
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x22B7633C
my wedding."
0xBC982221

0x0F7B6850
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xE325A38E
no wish to go to bed."
0x6E25F65B

0x0F7B6850
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x67E89524

0x0F7B6850
"All, sir."
0xCEC90ED1

0x0F7B6850
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xCB856C50
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x88C787DC
from church."
0x6A6BD147

0x0F7B6850
"Very well, sir."
0xD4F6E04F

0x0F7B6850
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0x39C686B1
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x27FAA947
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0x7944BBBE

0x0F7B6850
"I believe I am."
0x7E72A70B

0x0F7B6850
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x784EC5CE

0x0F7B6850
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xCC4774D9
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xCF571393
charged?"
0xB3D0480D

0x0F7B6850
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0x2B7B865D
over-fatigued."
0x0600B15F

0x0F7B6850
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0x7172F6F9

0x0F7B6850
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0xD494849C

0x0F7B6850
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xC0D17718
and flushed.
0xEEAA48D7

0x0F7B6850
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xB782C927
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0x0A5855FB
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0xDC5B58CE

0x0F7B6850
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x9109E2B5

0x0F7B6850
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0xD67104B5
new life into which you are passing?"
0x0096D991

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0x61403287
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x12C2BAA7

0x0F7B6850
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x40D472DF

0x0F7B6850
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0xAA2E6BD2
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0x1C1F7C97
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x5814FB3D
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0xD7E6F10D
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0xC831E65D

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x9A9ED705
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0x04800EEB
proceeded.
0x29AACEB3

0x0F7B6850
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0xEFD5B321
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0xA51B7EAB
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x6069AA36
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xF18853C6
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x7B81AE39
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x174E5B65
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x7961C9B5
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0xC9355FAA
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0x01D16DA8
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x23823740
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x46D80014
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x7E0D8FB1
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x1005555A
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0x60760643
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x7ECE85E7
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0xE343EBD2
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0x00AD6582
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x5309F332
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0xD4E380D8
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0xB0CFD488
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x6A62DBA9
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0xD19CC801
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x09A46EC4
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0xBBE18950
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x07EED68D
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x1329A7B4
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x6847C3E9
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0xA464D285
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x7544E41D
coronet."
0xF9AF3A8D

0x0F7B6850
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0x2B9DF25E
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x6670A283
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x583CB7AC

0x0F7B6850
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x6DE8D5D0
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0xB4783177
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x4E7912A7
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x5B01E13C
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0xB4867AF5
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x6867B9AF
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x1C8283B5
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0x02F6639B
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x06C46AB7
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xE648E76A
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0xF9610999
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xFCFEBE85
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x8AB0A69B
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x3F12A5E7
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0xD37E71B8
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0x84F82152
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0xDDFB24ED
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x04B516BF
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x9C303764
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0x3F9519E7
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x36A6B56E
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0xA8B17EAC
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x80D33A23
moment."
0xA80A3EBC

0x0F7B6850
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0xB1B181B2
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x0459DD1A
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xE1AA119D
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0x7D02556E
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xD87B614D
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x3D25CDF7
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0xA7F3693F
Jane?--repeat it."
0x70A3A9F3

0x0F7B6850
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
0xDD7BC982

0x0F7B6850
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0xAAA63179
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x961EB956
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0x957EFD4C
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x8E064BBC
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0xEA344323
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x5419776C
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0xAE6125D8
incensed than saddened."
0x4B0461D7

0x0F7B6850
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0xEBAB4266
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0xD21D471F

0x0F7B6850
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0xFE8E5927
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x96D1B571

0x0F7B6850
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x88E9A371
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0x97A21696

0x0F7B6850
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x1C351074
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0xEAC7B5E1

0x0F7B6850
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0xF2209E8F
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0xCE46728E
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x0CC5B68C
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0xB27F1659
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x6694CE50
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x3C3122E5
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0xC2D30480
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x873B3AC8
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x7B02CE13
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0x78712176
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0xCBD378F8
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0xEEC01CE2
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x168D1C40
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0xD59273D4
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x838B1F1C
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0xF1C4C805
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0xD27BF28D
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0x72F63D9B
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0xEA0AABD1
woke."
0x2AEA499E

0x0F7B6850
"Now, Jane, that is all."
0x515EE6E8

0x0F7B6850
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0xC3E3F329
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xD9585C70
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x85B201DB
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x97E28C75
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0xAD0D5D4E
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0xF5C733C0
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x3E07611E
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x3C537169
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0xC2126EA3
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0xB4DCE89E
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x876614FC
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0xB4E86CC1
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
0xB73156D3

0x0F7B6850
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
0xC025DFE6

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x4BC9336A
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0xCFACC17D
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0xF5EEDFE8

0x0F7B6850
"Describe it, Jane."
0x3926BFD0

0x0F7B6850
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0x0353C5AF
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x7153499C
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0x8534CE1F

0x0F7B6850
"Did you see her face?"
0x7C1A482A

0x0F7B6850
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0xE1F9EF10
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0x738F8F1C
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x532A3C50
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
0x7DEF910F

0x0F7B6850
"And how were they?"
0x99E78B01

0x0F7B6850
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
0xF05A144F
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x0BD745FA
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
0x5FD575BF

0x0F7B6850
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
0x080CF6F4

0x0F7B6850
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
0x38E69777
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
0x3B311F77
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
0xD413E031

0x0F7B6850
"You may."
0x6E9B65A8

0x0F7B6850
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
0x6F05EDBE

0x0F7B6850
"Ah!--what did it do?"
0x950FBAD8

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0xB368FEDF
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
0x7764DE50

0x0F7B6850
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
0x1EE245DF
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
0xBC82C77F

0x0F7B6850
"Afterwards?"
0x7565644B

0x0F7B6850
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
0x2C0C15F4
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x1E638AC9
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0x71A8FE37
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x76B08087
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0xB4C9F8DA
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0xF284D927
from terror."
0x103B5913

0x0F7B6850
"Who was with you when you revived?"
0x4D38F08C

0x0F7B6850
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0x509E1B64
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0x16C9736B
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
0xB78A35BA
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
0x4131BE1C

0x0F7B6850
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
0x0D78AEC7
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
0x4636EDB5
handling."
0xFBE7D9DC

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
0xDF7463F7
transaction actually took place."
0x86FC53DD

0x0F7B6850
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0x6D856A6E
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x60EDFDC2
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x6D0EE19F

0x0F7B6850
"Not yet."
0x573AE47F

0x0F7B6850
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0x1768358F
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0xC2E20436
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x15198CC1

0x0F7B6850
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x21D8FBC3
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0x7C34A636
mystery of that awful visitant."
0xEB8B64BA

0x0F7B6850
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0xECB72DD0

0x0F7B6850
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xBE89F705
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x42848E9B
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x29DD6E5D
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x9106ADFD
to bottom in two halves!"
0x6EFD16DF

0x0F7B6850
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0x4C070940
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x3FAF7689
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x42754402
might have happened!"
0x72E2449A

0x0F7B6850
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0xEFBACB75
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x0EAA4C1B

0x0F7B6850
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x5BEE8E28
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0xCA259EF0
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0xAFB17107
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0x6D8EB9A0
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0xF2630200
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0xFC692C31
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x1B9916B0
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x77F02D79
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0xE73E0FDD
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x1EDF8FA5
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0xC6C9FA77
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0x021819D7
solution of the mystery?"
0xFF783AB2

0x0F7B6850
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xF27917D0
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0xF1E5BD55
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0xE6167948
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x93A8CD74

0x0F7B6850
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x305F8F49
candle.
0x5C981F79

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x84FA4954
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xD3DF825E
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x0D2DC8EC
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0xB6B9A9F4

0x0F7B6850
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x13723F78

0x0F7B6850
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x69781DDA
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0xE7A3F1F2
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0x59B65387
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0x23BBE28A
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x7A7B4EBC
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0xC53259C9
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x21378F4C

0x0F7B6850
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x99F4C4C3
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0xA57AD411
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0xFE645065

0x0F7B6850
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x8A709A49
Janet now?"
0x10BB73B0

0x0F7B6850
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x954D8D79

0x0F7B6850
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0xC215007A
love and blissful union."
0x9B3154C2

0x0F7B6850
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0xA32B8CE3
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0x82C8504D
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x99BB3D4A
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x2CC3DB2C
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0xC25A3F87
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0xA9C45B37
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0xEB0DA756
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x268E7DF7
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x8821D4E7
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0x1A08388A
day.
0x7882C33C

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXVI
0x28BFC604

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xB4566D13
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0xCCE1505B
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0x3C138B16
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x0CF50FD4
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0xB9CB40A6

0x0F7B6850
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x8B705C4D
not taken one peep."
0xE5B7E75A

0x0F7B6850
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0xA6F682CA
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0xF921DB13
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0x948DF05A
by Mr. Rochester.
0xC6283AC2

0x0F7B6850
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x01CBC53C
so long!"
0x66258ACF

0x0F7B6850
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0xB3A9BA08
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0xC2BD29C4
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x178A42D2
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x7DA8BEB8
footman, answered it.
0x821BEBEA

0x0F7B6850
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xB26E74D4

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0xFED75E3D

0x0F7B6850
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x68EFCAED

0x0F7B6850
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0xD4E22864
there: return and tell me."
0x2DABDEA9

0x0F7B6850
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0x6B94A560
footman soon returned.
0xD2782E18

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0x63ECB48B

0x0F7B6850
"And the carriage?"
0xFFC8CE71

0x0F7B6850
"The horses are harnessing."
0xD1BDFEF1

0x0F7B6850
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0x41DE491E
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0xA1C1F1CE
coachman in his seat."
0xECD3EDA5

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x95AEBF9A

0x0F7B6850
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x435A102B
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x7DFEABFC
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x3F07750E
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x26B100F4
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x8B4DC467
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xC5FF77C5
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x8DE19703
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x5D0306D7
and flashing eyes.
0xEAFA6390

0x0F7B6850
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x84B0D794
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0x78A0B282
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x5ACE34A6
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0xF326E6E2
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0x6AFE27EA
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x71B320D9

0x0F7B6850
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0xCC84AE74
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x94ACE596
me, Jane."
0x0ABF21B6

0x0F7B6850
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0x08BC610A
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x5C2AFF1E
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x86EEDDB4
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0xBD09AF23
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x9D2D7750
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0x4564A613
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x264E4205
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0xFAC833AD
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x70CC2DEF
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x0739F7DD
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0xE5D7C71A
path to the porch.
0x855086A9

0x0F7B6850
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0xE25DED60
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x68384263
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x37ECADD9
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x260EBC9D
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x5C8D4722
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x55AC0C24
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x1CA639B7
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0xEFC6D73F

0x0F7B6850
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x321C8130
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0xF88A398D
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0x0304E03A
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x64720656
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x65E878D8
Rochester, went on.
0xF6B37F65

0x0F7B6850
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x8FB54218
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x8CAEDD65
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x08F5D56A
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0xF265AA66
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0xE6BA62ED
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0xA9CCDB1B

0x0F7B6850
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0xF3A0411A
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x69002FA0
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x10FB37FD
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x75BF9AB5
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0x247596BF
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x131C32DF

0x0F7B6850
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xAE5749D7

0x0F7B6850
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0xC051C5A5
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x643C1A6F
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x387E62E0
said, "Proceed."
0x13AF916A

0x0F7B6850
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x3DBC04CA
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0x2807247B

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x8AD6897F
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x94187104

0x0F7B6850
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x2E55AD8D
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x623CD231
marriage exists."
0x000923B9

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0xB2F9B50A
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0xC8F565C4
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x13E0F99A
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0xDBDB224A
beneath!
0xA192B0D3

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x9F4A3A1F
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0xB450153A

0x0F7B6850
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0xD1236AD5
advisedly."
0x9A32763F

0x0F7B6850
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x3FF378B6
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0xFEC8471F

0x0F7B6850
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0x93230185
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x0BDBB656

0x0F7B6850
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0x8F565998
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xE09E0D99
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0x4A8CEAAA
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x9761297C
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0x453EDBEC
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0x359D682F
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x8808309E
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0xCBE21EBC

0x0F7B6850
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0x530DC18D

0x0F7B6850
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x22FD1433

0x0F7B6850
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x8D0C39ED

0x0F7B6850
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0xF746E575
recognises, if you do not."
0x61A58304

0x0F7B6850
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0xB9C99629
place of abode."
0x0B7C292D

0x0F7B6850
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xE2EC2AE9
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x466637AF

0x0F7B6850
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xB9EB2820
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0xD3CD44F6
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0xF8F8B826
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0x81726CC3
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0x32D197F1
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
0xF5A74089
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0x61FCF707
Mason.'"
0xA76705B8

0x0F7B6850
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x0AFA44F1
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x92F1DF61

0x0F7B6850
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x548CF5BB

0x0F7B6850
"How do you know?"
0x0C01BB1D

0x0F7B6850
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x6BC43082
scarcely controvert."
0x62E3CB61

0x0F7B6850
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x5AA82DE9

0x0F7B6850
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x024047B0
goodness to step forward."
0xC431DFEF

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x1F4E64B2
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xAEB22DB8
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0xF767A780
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x3921E1B5
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x38EC450C
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0xFB31D89F
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0x3DBD1109
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x920AC917
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0xC8BD88A4
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x9C94FE2A
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x9697FB05
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x7D7B797C
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0xE589F46A
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xC064F2B9

0x0F7B6850
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0xC36695FE

0x0F7B6850
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0xCFC1EEA9
what have you to say?"
0xB23BC452

0x0F7B6850
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0xA4A4F73A
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x1FA111F7
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x0F32C1EA

0x0F7B6850
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x82D4824F

0x0F7B6850
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x0CB6EB2E
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0xBACFD222

0x0F7B6850
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x100CE292
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x743F5343
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x71F3CB71

0x0F7B6850
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0xD0EF527C

0x0F7B6850
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x4F27055E
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x323E6372
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0xEDD520D3

0x0F7B6850
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0x9454021F
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0xB4BC7366
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x13C63E5B
obeyed.
0x86487F7B

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x12403261
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x14CAA657
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0xE4593746
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x2638A7EA
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xDFE70DEE
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x975DBCF7
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x3EE0ECD6
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xF333587F
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x2A68EA67
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x5DB5A847
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x53277B55
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xFC86E5AD
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x81571B93
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x1F7D65C1
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x14A1C43E
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0xEA5CCE0D
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x02C19766
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x94794B39
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x9AE3185B
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x36C679AA
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0xEEC48F5F
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x43B54A28
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x28F940A7
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0xF0443003
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x353A87BB
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0xF3CD2090
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0xD2D6356C
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x568FE088
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x5CBC00EA
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x57BB60A5
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0xE4D90888
you--follow!"
0x37F1DA8E

0x0F7B6850
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0xECC83214
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0xBE4711FF

0x0F7B6850
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x1F45C908
will not be wanted to-day."
0xEDB12177

0x0F7B6850
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0xEA93F832
greet us.
0x28F39B85

0x0F7B6850
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0xB3F83985
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0x4213BE30
late!"
0xEC036EBE

0x0F7B6850
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x34B30E84
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x069980CE
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0xCE315EC7
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xB821D49F
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0xA988F215

0x0F7B6850
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0x9844DAB3
here."
0xCE1D4470

0x0F7B6850
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x4FAD359A
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0xAE47933C
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x6CB090CE
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x4B0CF0C7
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x1B2793C6
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0xC06C85E7
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x8331571F
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0x6D4B3B50
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x3D06B231
mane, hid its head and face.
0x2F6B8990

0x0F7B6850
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x2AE59833
your charge to-day?"
0xD81855E1

0x0F7B6850
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0xE8F01D71
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x96B944DF

0x0F7B6850
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x8CFD3ABE
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x8BB9263B

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0xE76A9AF5

0x0F7B6850
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x94485BD6

0x0F7B6850
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x261FB928

0x0F7B6850
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x4BE33455
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x1292F3EC
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0xBFE7EEC9

0x0F7B6850
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0xD3D7A555
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x0AE6C30E

0x0F7B6850
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x4D9F58CC
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x2F272BDC

0x0F7B6850
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x32229B98

0x0F7B6850
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x20AEA730

0x0F7B6850
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x858FCB07
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x3A9F2A60
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xAB99CAB6
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0x949BE155
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x0388F918
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0x5414FD06
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x1B83FD99
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0xCC15E7D7
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x783AF75E
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x2BDB1B53
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x89161240
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0xF2BED347

0x0F7B6850
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0x71BEB1B0
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0x029BFD3C
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x2F6F2633
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0xDCDE29C4
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x2FDC2FAC
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0x53EA2666
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x504DA48B
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0xD158A474
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0xD26246DD
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x9E431546

0x0F7B6850
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0x0C5B82F4
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0x18EBA379
the stair.
0x0493B184

0x0F7B6850
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0xEF9F7E57
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x1A619233
returns to Madeira."
0x4D0C8FC7

0x0F7B6850
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x72628261

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xE2AFC7C1
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xFE8221D7
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0xFE2D7251
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x08BA7852
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0x9E37BF20
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x72832CB7
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0xC0CBF457
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x3AAE2CF0
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x439BA8AA
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xCA436AD3
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x3AC46D11
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x6C8191ED
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x72AC3AAF
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x0D0000D5
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x70D69361
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0xD24A697D
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0xD17E7279
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0xEFFDFDB5
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xE879D34A

0x0F7B6850
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xD3C73B84
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0x3DE604E8
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0x42DD0B6A
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x66651C98

0x0F7B6850
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0xE2BFEE4E
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x980119B4
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0xC01C7924
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0x9CA54386
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x32EBAB43
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x8AEFF638
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x0A2141D5
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x29780728
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0xCA5D2871
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0x59C48B7C

0x0F7B6850
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x7C580EA6
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0xFD7CE44A
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0xC69A9533
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0xE342F2D3
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x63FAD608
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0x1DE4CBF4
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x6EAE43C6
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0xAD9CE393

0x0F7B6850
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x6C9618E9
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x0D54C541
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0x21DE0261
prospects?
0xF42B7A6D

0x0F7B6850
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x8B260A89
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x2623A0C8
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x4BE8297B
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x7DF3479A
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0xCCB39AD6
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x1BF9A6D6
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xB9A9F43B
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0x08F4E82B
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0x796E8F94
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0xCF942875
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x59E517A6
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x8C5ECC7E
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0x27117D25
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x45C4A97E
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0xB82D4CAA
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x78B46370
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x5A6D31EE
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0xE08D30E0
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x320BF709
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x4C15AE80
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x89E7FE13
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x1D5728C2
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0xF41B3954
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0x94608813
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0xA2EAF8DA
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0xAE31FA1B
conduct!
0xEEFEBD5C

0x0F7B6850
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0x8D44264F
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x78C77592
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x59331ACA
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0xD3438FE4
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0xC06966E2
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xDD252A86
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x258A99CA
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0x8FC9567E
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x75ACD485

0x0F7B6850
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x71015A98

0x0F7B6850
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x95D731C1
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x0F21976F
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x27F63C88
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0xD08D15CE
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x2906A5D2
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x23CD68BB
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0xB31B3EDA
floods overflowed me."
0xE55D8681

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXVII
0xB1B078DE

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x337D34AE
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0xE1EB0259
"What am I to do?"
0x2D5868F6

0x0F7B6850
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xFE7D60B7
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0xC1A176B0
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0xBBC38DD4
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x786BDDBD
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x187938C9
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0x598C326A
cannot do it."
0x0923C8A4

0x0F7B6850
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x19ADB276
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x40144B69
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xC396AFC3
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0xC35823CE
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x85C47CFA
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x93AAB5D6
depths of agony.
0xAD6A74E8

0x0F7B6850
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0xA5C7DC19

0x0F7B6850
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x7B3A562C
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x22561522
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x89297D6E

0x0F7B6850
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0xB8B22339
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x028D7112
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0x95CDA2F0
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x44A72F9F
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x8B6C3D88
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0xC6DB8639
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x1745AE9D
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x7F90A21D
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x95CAFF38
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0xD2C7BE36
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x4A774873
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xA5D9FD20
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xB42BCECD
threshold.
0x1CA49F5D

0x0F7B6850
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x46455728
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xAB1817E6
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x8257F8D8
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xD10A68FD
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x7C9EEF19
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x7AC53030
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0x0946E809
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0x4C5F5499
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0xDD9972F4
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x7E9CBEEF

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x347E820A
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x98C926B3
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x5694299D

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x3B2C0028
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x5E653D65
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0xF64106EB
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xD5EF1C5D
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x61935005

0x0F7B6850
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0xA94A1EBC
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x0AF4B7EE
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x786CDC9B
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xEFE2CDB7
heart's core.
0xAF148CED

0x0F7B6850
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x5026FE9A
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0xAAEA1496
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0x89CEE814

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xF0DA7A36

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xE6343B5F
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x7CEA18C3
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x42175D9C
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x1B616C34
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x6E5169E7
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x029554DD
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0xEA354BB3
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0xFD937A16
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0xFD657FF2
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x9FF2ED49
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x5F8C2A21
him."
0x1F31C36A

0x0F7B6850
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x253525CE

0x0F7B6850
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x9FCC5BBE

0x0F7B6850
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x158B4667

0x0F7B6850
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x38BB15E3
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0x3DBF2891
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0xF642E916
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x4BEC07C3
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0x763F9771
put his aside.
0xA7FEE7CC

0x0F7B6850
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x6B614EA8
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0xB174DB0A
appropriated?"
0xB81E1A16

0x0F7B6850
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0xE7301184

0x0F7B6850
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0xBB04CD37
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x91D47EEB
rightly?"
0x5975AA63

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x53157483
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x0A6DD87D
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0x571FC004
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0xDDC3DF78
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x5D7BA32F
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x2F57A4CA
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x2E583B5D
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x1570F527
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x5C2BA6ED
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x6E53540E
know you--I am on my guard."
0xACC6506A

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0xD58E19C7
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0x45DFDEFA

0x0F7B6850
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0xF642898B
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0xD13FCF10
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0xAC0807C6
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x7B56DA2D
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x013EE2AD
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x05F89FBB
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x539CE23C
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x1359F854

0x0F7B6850
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x63488D23
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x9C9A498D
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x49D75720
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x6EA5936B

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0xE1F326CD
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0xDC24B588
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x13ADE0A2
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0x519A0F88
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0x88A53AD5
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0x65B5E562
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x12C70AB1
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x3ABCA16A
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0x8BF94B40
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xD13F46F3
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0x1360AF9B
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x0AB5BB0D
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x97C774D1
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x50A20D76
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0xE188E576
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0x56C8CDF7
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0xA0A6A3F7
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0xE5213EDE

0x0F7B6850
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0x726A967E
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x0F3E6B75
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x7939D16D
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0xC9F7E9CC
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0x4A10A53D
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0xCBD4F006
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0xEE6314B1
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0x1D794882
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x39FF1B14
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0xC1B0E6C6

0x0F7B6850
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xAB97D97D
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xF42D6BAE
cannot help being mad."
0xC8ECB435

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x8B2DB979
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x3C1B8B39
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x86BB2E42

0x0F7B6850
"I do indeed, sir."
0x48426B84

0x0F7B6850
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0x3D692BA4
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x158B8103
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x2E32FEAA
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x158D1ED0
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xA3F67AB7
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x8D8180A5
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0x9E2F947C
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0x2254A962
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x7513C26C
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0xB10C4E4B
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x5DCF3EC3
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x31CD1290
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0xC1619A47
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0xFBC7D72E
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0xBB8D38E2
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0x027B473D
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x8B182281
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x62C8D2D6
falsehood and slander."
0x15BB7DB3

0x0F7B6850
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xE8CEA602
for you."
0x2BBA3763

0x0F7B6850
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0xF8407748
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0xC42445D9
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0x23A23F80
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xCB6E7859

0x0F7B6850
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x8993FDCB
too dull for you."
0x6F61DBBA

0x0F7B6850
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0xE968A476
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0xDD1D212A
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0xE0878C59

0x0F7B6850
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x9DE83B8D
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xAF1142FB
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xCA4AF428
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x203211F8
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xC66D8AF8

0x0F7B6850
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0x45F3FE9E
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x3C0BD552
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0xF4A63DE8
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xB1152C65
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0xD64585AB
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xD497876F

0x0F7B6850
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x058543C5
before me.
0x487876A9

0x0F7B6850
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0x71ECD0B8
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x1298A663
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x9F8984C2
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x6FECBEF2
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0x814E4ED9
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0xA88EA525
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xBDCC8D90
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x63139839
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xB8E598FC
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x307E5226
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x46BBF6A6
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x382461EA
soothingly--
0x52ECFC2D

0x0F7B6850
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x248D5DB0
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0xFC3F15C3

0x0F7B6850
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0xAF065C9A
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x4E679DBD
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0xE7693A54
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x44036958
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x99BAD197
heartily.
0x45707B93

0x0F7B6850
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0xD38EE935
not while he was in such a passion.
0x5ADDCE81

0x0F7B6850
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0xC6E87124
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x4B327EF1
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0xA01C5EE9

0x0F7B6850
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x487169E6
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0x5A8641D8
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x606434F2

0x0F7B6850
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xD08E7B7C
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0xF081DD9C
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x13FBE95A
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x034D7391
were some toad or ape."
0xDB5B74C8

0x0F7B6850
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0xF56B567C
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x1AE5A75F
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x55BC4D2A
where I had wounded.
0xBFB29E0F

0x0F7B6850
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x623BA08B
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0xBE74F411

0x0F7B6850
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0x1E932549
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0xD2317984

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0x4D89126C
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0xF0CD32E1

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
0x9A4F2140

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
0x65D013A4

0x0F7B6850
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0x2F77EF1E
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
0x6B3D679E

0x0F7B6850
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0x52C68B48
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x7D36F2FF
scenes."
0x4508D256

0x0F7B6850
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x48F132D7
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0xC9E7CE3C
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xCCED260F
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0x915DB115
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x75F40B28
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0xCB36F1B2
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0xA87CC84E
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x4E54A1E5
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x58E79E25
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x133E1174

0x0F7B6850
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0x8C96F6EB
still I dared to speak.
0x070F8B40

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x4E733176
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0xADFBE2B9
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0xE3B081FD

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x607518D2
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xC5C3B656
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0x14F69DC9

0x0F7B6850
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xA059B01B
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x5D50F00B
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0xD71DEB0C
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x0B173B9F
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0xEC3157D5
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0xAB8F84DD

0x0F7B6850
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0x3050E6E9
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0x9730B3D7
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0x5382A915
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x2D428888
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0xF653B245
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x3350F4B1
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0xFD5E9DE5
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0xE83B29A1

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
0xE8A031AA

0x0F7B6850
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x493C5DF8
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0x02E4B11B

0x0F7B6850
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0xB994D263

0x0F7B6850
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0x51C409B7

0x0F7B6850
"I have understood something to that effect."
0xF76A988E

0x0F7B6850
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0xDADB5C4D
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0x34314383
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x23580FE8
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x60035472
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0xA96C5117
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x47B07D72
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x6B87AE34
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0xB7F56455
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0xE2C227E9
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0xD3B14B2F
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x3A96AE1C
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xCBCAF1F1
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x2CE7A8D9
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x38311501
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x254B3816
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0x3FBF2DCC
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x32B8A136
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0x6D87C694
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x32E2A842
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x34366DAD
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x732357E7
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x37ABC6FB
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0x72C9202A
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0xD2C4D129
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x3321F9AC
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0xBABD44B5
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0xAAB0C923
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x30E469A1
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0xFE24A94C
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x070C7692
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x07DA5A11
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
0x833061DF

0x0F7B6850
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x6B7395DC
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0xC87C15CA
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0xC2060207
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0x989EA224
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0x1617D786
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0xAC855159
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0xF49F8991
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x06E12D3B
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0xF33AEC2A
plot against me."
0xA630E891

0x0F7B6850
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0xA2715030
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0xDD25AECB
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0x079E09EC
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0x3B41884A
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0x0FE59471
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
0xC505B663
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x90F84B09
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0xF42B17F5
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x1A7884C8
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x0A69B3A1
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0x483C091F
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x4E5C1CAA
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0x3B1C97F9
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x0CCA65F5
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
0x2E2C3249

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0xD459ECEC
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0xCB1AC299
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x6DBACD53
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0xAC8891CA
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0xEB7C80CB
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0x570336A1
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x3D4841C2
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0xF60BC4AD
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0xADF0770E
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
0xCAFDCCAD

0x0F7B6850
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
0xF200D864
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0x86BF0489
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0xB04D1D79
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0xEFDE1826
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x43C0BDE7
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x63140BCA
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
0xC67813C3
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
0xDEAB9F58

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
0xB8A9E7C6

0x0F7B6850
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
0xA4AF05B8
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0xB6058EE0
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0xBB356479
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0x07EAF0A4
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0x8CB2145F
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
0xD0FA54FD
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xFF6922EF
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x1E6A8A3F
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0x35684E64
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x697F1CBE
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
0xF87B9841

0x0F7B6850
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
0x794857BB

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0x727DFC9B
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0x936FFD8C
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x889FC49E
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x8064C631
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0xE7FC4B5C
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x99898859
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x71B07189
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x065566CC
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x0D143F3F
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0xC929278A
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xE497DB91
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x949B7A17
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x201B7B3E
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
0xF8C04A60

0x0F7B6850
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x5A01BEEF
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0xCE188693
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0xD9F66565
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0xBC1DD142
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x6685D484
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0x5D06D8DA
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xCE1C75E5
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x3ED0FF33
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0xB4A2CF59
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0xD8720BE1
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x5F9833BE
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0xBF8F61E3
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xB302E584
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xE987B7D9
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0xA086F412
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
0x4CCD0E7A

0x0F7B6850
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
0x21CB182A
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0x8C716161
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0x61A953AF
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0x4EB82442
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x8A58608D
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
0xF4BFC5C1

0x0F7B6850
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
0x1DEDDD3E
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
0xA3223594
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0x0C27D4FA
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0xCAF9AC6C
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
0xED93817F

0x0F7B6850
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
0x765A0218
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
0xB0300AEE
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
0xC6868C7A
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
0x11CB7E17
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0xE1B5DE3D
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
0xD51F9DF8
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
0x62105D86
follow.
0x3ECF9777

0x0F7B6850
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
0x820D9472
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x7A675D41
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0x565E83CE
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0x25516C52
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0x3B1E6F27
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0x1A667D02
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
0xFC151027

0x0F7B6850
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
0x094ECE68
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
0x422FCA57
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
0x90ADF491
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
0xE7407254
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
0x78F1CE42
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
0x7CF05E63
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
0x266B3154
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0xE490F237
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0xAF97F80A
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0x675F8860
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
0x298B30BC
and leave her.'
0xB9558F46

0x0F7B6850
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0xB7C21977
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0xCF68A386
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0xBED7C44B
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0xC27DB3B4
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x3C8DB0A5
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0x02187C54
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0xF70933B2
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0x2F4AFEC5
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0xE3B93251

0x0F7B6850
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0xAD6AA14A
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0xE0267074
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0x68681E3B
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0xCAA666DE
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0x604C7F8E
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0xBAC78367
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0xB0CA5583
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0xA7B3EEF1
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0x87F5971B
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0xB5289C51
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0xCB51D201
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0x8D9B5607
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0x6A5C2281
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0xF8A4A361
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0xB737DEE6
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x7E3C56F5
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0xFFDD4540
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x8804F931
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x69494627
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0xFAA6B57E
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0xDDC9EE3A
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0xA8C2CA3D
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0xEE899F18
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x529E570C
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x79E3649D
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0x542EF380
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
0x96D9FB3D

0x0F7B6850
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0xEBF951AB
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
0xC87C835A

0x0F7B6850
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0x4CE0B918
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0xF847AB43
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0x47076483
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x62D367BC
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
0xF2965563

0x0F7B6850
"But you could not marry, sir."
0x8D807F75

0x0F7B6850
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
0xA915AE00
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0x4289E3B6
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0xCE6F2C4D
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0x136F53ED
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
0x7773D0B9
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
0x304C7408
burdened."
0xE412FD11

0x0F7B6850
"Well, sir?"
0xB9140CE9

0x0F7B6850
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
0x086F248D
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0xD619BFB5
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x8FD36D79
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0x4EAF35DE
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0xD6A1443B
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0x531AAC30
don't very well know why."
0x7D282AB9

0x0F7B6850
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
0xA6D97B13

0x0F7B6850
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
0x17E98F72

0x0F7B6850
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
0x646054A2
and what she said."
0x83E321A4

0x0F7B6850
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
0xD6DB7AA2
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0xAF220546
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x5FD91AA4
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0xC6B72AC0
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x4293165E
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x42CAE179
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x9CC46B83
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0x589F1A9E
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0xD8388864
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0xE5FD3EFB
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0xF4913145
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x0C094A48
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x99558F28
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x18F5F96A
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x95B557DE
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xE948F450
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0xF759E661
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0x7BFB4C68
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0xE1DB5CA8
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
0xAB11BC04

0x0F7B6850
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0x2C248654
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0x1E012F66
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0xE1384326
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x33DFF0F9
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0xBCB7A7B1
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0x3CF777A8
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0x9DFC3FB6
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x4106E447
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0xB27CABDA
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x2A74FECA
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x2E739D01
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0xFF5E2C97

0x0F7B6850
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x115961C4
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x841A15FD
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0x188758F6

0x0F7B6850
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0xAB8E14A0
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x08C69C80
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0x08C2DD3B
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0xEBFD23F5
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0x3C9759BD
Giacinta, and Clara."
0x78A76AFF

0x0F7B6850
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0xCEB1905C
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0xF3F9E706
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0xE651BB39
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0xA5CCEC21
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0x3DEF5805
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0x0B09C658
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x3221242A
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x46E47683

0x0F7B6850
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0x318DAC72
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x9B81A817
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x3FDF8E27
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0xAF7DD55D
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0xBFFB267F
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0xE37271D5
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0xE6D4DF21
back to England.
0xE1E6A139

0x0F7B6850
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0xFC8EBDDF
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0x0DF16EE5
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xD6EAD4F5
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0xA67A4402
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x494AD8CC
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0xDFD31C69
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0xCF74DBEC
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0xD3F03CE3
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x068D3C22
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x847D38A1
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xD1560F56
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x434F1CE8

0x0F7B6850
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x24414717
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0x72608D3D
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xF2A6F9FA
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0xF970062A
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x22D55550
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x6DDEFDD0
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x1F52B37E
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xF6E44A15
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0xABB12B5C
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x7BF36DA4
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0xE3F62876
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0xC46E5BAC
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x356AE7BE
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0xE70AB150
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x09F9034F
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xA2A8022B
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0x612FEF52
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0xC5C60BBF
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x41154B8B
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0xA5EF71D9
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0xB933EB56
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0x370E8C9D
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x9353D95D
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0x8955CB03
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x4A1EF3B0
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0xEB5D3C52
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0xFE0FABC0
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x6E6AB17D
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x06EE659B
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0xEE79F429
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xA8BA1A03
out of my sight.
0x8932F424

0x0F7B6850
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xCE89D3BB
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0xA10159CA
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x9D562175
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x49B0D33F
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0xCCC436C5
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0xEB46FF05
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x43C084B5
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x0ABD67FB
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x2A4159E8
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0xFA42180F
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0xA8B2CCCB
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0x16850300
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x49BE78A5
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0xC545A6B3
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0x8BF2C2EF
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xCACD8B74
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0xF0B341EB
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x19C12E21
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0xEF403BB4
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x46260013
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0x90D7A35A
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x2C714F38
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xC9481EDA
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xBA48280A
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x7D8F00FA
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x4C605CB9
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x265EAF77
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x8CED822F
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x86079587
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0xCE26430B
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0x5398FF8D
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x267C5990
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0x71A56C06
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x5D81AA89

0x0F7B6850
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x4A7BA495
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x269FBE5E
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0xF8FA8782
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x77C55DA4
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x360BDC89
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0x206103C5
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0x71964B1F
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x4EF1CA25
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0xF380E8A5
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0xEB6786EB
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0xA37CCA34
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x9D643FF4
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0xCFA78DF9
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0x05AF4F6C

0x0F7B6850
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x88AEFE8C
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0xFC352726
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xD6E7F178
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0xB178DF34

0x0F7B6850
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0xF509CA26
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0xA7E64C32

0x0F7B6850
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0xDAF807E0

0x0F7B6850
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x1125D8B2
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x1E5DAAA1
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x22835A0F
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x0B886F42
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x111DD057
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xB9943441
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x1382062E
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0x4457C848

0x0F7B6850
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0x26DEF785
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x0F63E500
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x3C48341B
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0xDCF3162A
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x72A8414F
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x3CFF2E90
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x1EC222CD
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x08A0E66C
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x5D16B5AF
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x6FDE0C64
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x79868D8C
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0xC83ADA51

0x0F7B6850
A pause.
0xF7A5A3EB

0x0F7B6850
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x8D36E0CC

0x0F7B6850
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x7C82FF31
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0x862C2FBF
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x5991C972
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x84549756
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0xADDF43AD

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x01C96C05
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0x7665F656

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0xFCFD0934

0x0F7B6850
Another long silence.
0x5EA9C019

0x0F7B6850
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0x4F7278DA
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x5CAA53DC
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x4B38F5C9
and to let me go another?"
0xDEFB9E4D

0x0F7B6850
"I do."
0x22F36D12

0x0F7B6850
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x2E248BF3

0x0F7B6850
"I do."
0x22F36D12

0x0F7B6850
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0x6192F5AD

0x0F7B6850
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0x65614055

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x4537EABE
to love me."
0xDBF53404

0x0F7B6850
"It would to obey you."
0x837FBA06

0x0F7B6850
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0x9F994571
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x8E2CE782
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x21985ECE

0x0F7B6850
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0x1AF4FB3C
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x858DCA5E
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x64A8F75D
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xC6A9234C
companion and for some hope?"
0x6E2F5057

0x0F7B6850
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x2AFA92B7
again there."
0xB2C2FCD1

0x0F7B6850
"Then you will not yield?"
0xF7EAFF8C

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0xF866F388
rose.
0x20460273

0x0F7B6850
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x8EC781F1

0x0F7B6850
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x50F6D5B9
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x194BFD0A

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x83405842
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0xC3A92FC6
will forget me before I forget you."
0xBDF11C68

0x0F7B6850
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x4A4CB6A9
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x66DE54F9
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0xF11F3D8B
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x99FB1A1F
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x6903002B
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0xDE0AB13F
by living with me?"
0x7811E60B

0x0F7B6850
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0xF0E0DC5F
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0xE5F2D4A4
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x4854208F
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x0163D0BD
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x32309CC2
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0x8679BF46
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x53613443
who will be injured by what you do?"
0xA72907B5

0x0F7B6850
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0xBC881168
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x8CC4752B
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x104C4BC7
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x215CEE15
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0xC2FAB3A2
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x42A816AD
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0x22432B02
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0xBE75F128
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x7A7820A3
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x30B18D40
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0xE8896DB5
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x683C003C
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xC2018C9C

0x0F7B6850
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x236B51E8
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x07B1BF8A
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x17BB9F24
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0xC67473D2
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x8F0BF5F9
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x9D32BBB9
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0x38F4072E
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x625240AC
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0x3262251B
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0xBC88E8EB
strength almost exhausted.
0x7AB0CA7E

0x0F7B6850
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x6BF9A5F8
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x2AAA990D
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x93C5FECA
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0xB2543725
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x58F35264
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0x46C9DFF5
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0xB13902B3
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0xE2708425
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x8E843E4E
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0xE47678FC
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x0B7F94D4
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x87855058
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0xF5C5C3CB
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x50DC6C6D
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0xB96A0D26

0x0F7B6850
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0xCC914AFB
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x106071EA
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xEDBCE12F
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x9D552BBF

0x0F7B6850
"You are going, Jane?"
0x7DA5BD04

0x0F7B6850
"I am going, sir."
0x0C0AFBCA

0x0F7B6850
"You are leaving me?"
0x542AC1E0

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0xD865D42D
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x19780F2A

0x0F7B6850
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0xBFE7C64C
firmly, "I am going."
0x0418C690

0x0F7B6850
"Jane!"
0xC8CA591E

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester!"
0xC6342CDE

0x0F7B6850
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0xD8900E4C
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xF922691E
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0xA03645EC

0x0F7B6850
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x19BDE746
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x88EBFD19
deep, strong sob.
0x7DAF3215

0x0F7B6850
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x67CDFBE9
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0xBA449B7E
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0x1A1A80C0
hand.
0x332E110D

0x0F7B6850
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0x33A0B674
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to

me."
0x71AFB203

0x0F7B6850
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0xD7409EF1
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0x602156E6
yes--nobly, generously."
0xFBFDBF81

0x0F7B6850
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0x8AAE5D39
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x3608BC33
once quitted the room.
0x8F2CDD51

0x0F7B6850
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0xF7B59CF1
"Farewell for ever!"
0xB29634D9

0x0F7B6850

0x9B5D50D2

0x0F7B6850
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x1E788374
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x5C5C701D
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x1A2EA0B4
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0xF48641F4
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xC77BD059
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x20F53799
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0xF30E1401
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x65F988CF
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x9BB0F3C4
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x291CD80C
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0xA5A3665D
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0x4F82E563
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x0A95CF69
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x38687FAA
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0xC137D32F

0x0F7B6850
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x276331B2

0x0F7B6850
"Mother, I will."
0x3C7B36FE

0x0F7B6850
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x9F8A4571
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x5DA91462
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x72C16F70
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x722B0650
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x3DDFDC4F
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0xEA2B6754
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0xAD453853
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0xCA5A3CCE
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xC468F84A
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x069FF74B
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0xB14B51B5
from my room.
0x9B3FB21C

0x0F7B6850
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x32CFAFC3
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x2FDAE461
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xCDFEC2CC
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0x07F6EA55

0x0F7B6850
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xCA3786CE
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x85525E4A
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0xF463E093
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0xF7E52ADA
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x5CD91212
to go in and to say--
0x011B9DDC

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x9474A3F2
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0xB7E586FE
this.
0x35122AE2

0x0F7B6850
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x92202569
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x802F22E5
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0xAFF9548D
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0x0060746C
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x656C5394
on.
0x9A3BE47E

0x0F7B6850
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xD0D4AFE3
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0x253A7088
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0x3CEAAA85
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0xCD166E56
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0xF333CCCC
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x5D5A8A24
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x4381F47D
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x6C1AC4A0
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x527A322F

0x0F7B6850
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x0F15BD19
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x0C97D8E1
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0xFCCAAAAE
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0xF6EB4E1E
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x7D5675AD
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x2E1187BF
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0xB1C96D98
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x52B7D2B9

0x0F7B6850
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0xA7DE962A
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x2E6E9F2E
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x4C7C36A4
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0x30888C5C
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x1A4E20EC
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x3F1FCF63
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x78182E59
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x9CFA09CD
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0xE269919B
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0x7B60D64F
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x5A873A1F
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x0DAA0E66
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x5097FA72
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x56E73345
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0xDBA2D975
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x683C3E2D
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0xAD34A262
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0xDC903BDF
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0x4C2F9027
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0x74C4B2AC
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0xAA11A0D8
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x61BF496A
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xFEC59D51
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x947EB704
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0xC4F67A4C
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x018ABB9B
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0xFBD6D596
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x1C8B2BEC
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x8C1ABC39
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xF02DB765
ever to reach the road.
0x3DD759EF

0x0F7B6850
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0xDCF461CC
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xE79B538D
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x6FB68AB7
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0xB8CADD9C
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0xFF731B0E
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x3072A710
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x858EC851
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x4F2221A0

0x0F7B6850
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0xAD095440
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xDDD88F51
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x4B713475
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xE0F7A49A
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0x2666504A

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x766A2901
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0x7AEA4FCD
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xE43E9703
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0xB4E727D5
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0xB736E8D3
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0xB72BCDA0
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0xB8C09511

0x0F7B6850
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x6FA8ABAA
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xBC6F6964
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x158608E3
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0xEDEE414C
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x2755FADA
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xA3E62222
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0x55861E09
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xC5BCAD42
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x0190E1A3
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0xC2DA44F9
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x2A101A10
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0xA4802FEE
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x44FA0B16
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x4A9EECA1
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x358BD7BF
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x1F7039B6
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x46C1591A
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x9926C2EB
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x1F4CEB71
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0x40AF91C1

0x0F7B6850
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0xF008E8A4
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x33B183C9
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0x9930D990
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0xE68E0126
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0xB3B51EE4

0x0F7B6850
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x21EDAE92
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0xA6F19C0F
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0xE8254909
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xBEDA8935
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x15A3DE12
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0xD2D44798
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0x1FE29CF7
regained the faculty of reflection.
0xA287DE7C

0x0F7B6850
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x334632EA
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x988EB762
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0xDCA54B3D
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x3E0B6B04
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0xF557A0AF
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0xF7058FBA

0x0F7B6850
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xC9CD4DEA
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x0FFD48F0
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x81E084BD
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x01A23CCE
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0xCFE8DCE7
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0xDAFD5BC8
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0xE8C4CD58
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x5DDBE40E
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0xCA402CF9
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0x1FFA5413
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0xA34A0768
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x2F5A4803
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0xE748D512
then chose my couch.
0x70EE7A21

0x0F7B6850
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x5D6087F6

0x0F7B6850
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0xE0E6641C
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0xF53C05DE
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0xF69D1D02
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0xA84A7E5F
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x0D9B84C6

0x0F7B6850
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x9610DE6B
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0x5E987112
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x57C6FD0B
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0xE6136DA7
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xC7B06C25
attempts to seek him.
0xFB740B19

0x0F7B6850
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0x188596D4
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x37224361
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0x40E503B4
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0xCD8DC23B
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0x48E54E4C
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0x191E8986
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0xC6A7009F
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x67BA3173
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x098E0F3F
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x6F331A81
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0x2A064560
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x2CAA4D00
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x3445491B
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0xF05CFF67
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x88EB71BF
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x76120DB6

0x0F7B6850
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0xD7BAE6DF
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x2B75DD2D
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x2D683F01
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0xA943C56C
looked round me.
0x8BACFD42

0x0F7B6850
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0xE27941DC
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x62E3BFE5
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x2E534CE7
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0x4DE43B50
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x27017AD3
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x73E4685E
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0xA1FD806A
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0xECBC0839
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x82AF90BF
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xCAB9C0B6
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x7D646FA8
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x8E6361DA
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xF37BBCFE
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0x8CDDE3AB
out.
0x09BA64F0

0x0F7B6850
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0x92C5537C
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x8804FE1C
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0xB7D83791
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0x5F2FC14C
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0xE795C07F
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0xF6C913CC
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x6C4E0846

0x0F7B6850
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0xF0BD2262
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x3ACF7B41
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0x0B7E15D5
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x7131C26A
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x273468D0
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x76382424
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0xBA2BEEB8
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x06A025EF
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x2313A592
like the rest.
0xB5D7C5DB

0x0F7B6850
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0x06EEAF49
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x49EC997F
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x35983BFE
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x7918B676
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x5DC47112
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0xE8FDA013
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0xB134E230
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0xA1CBA7A2
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x20247DDC
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x4E53AC7D
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x2840AC4F
would not; but I must try.
0x7EBC957C

0x0F7B6850
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x71A83CD0
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x8F231815
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x0C7AB8B4
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x275DB6F4
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x04C1EDD3
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0xE6F28312
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0xF36F791D
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0xA45FA608
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0xB40211C6
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0xFDDBAEF2
the village?"
0xCFB9454E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0xE1D48826

0x0F7B6850
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x2091D0D0
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0xBE9EB195
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0xEF3EE796
apply somewhere.  Where?
0xC7C34A00

0x0F7B6850
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x739AD685
wanted?"
0x5EB7DD2F

0x0F7B6850
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0xC7786F07

0x0F7B6850
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x986BA664
do?"
0xB307C10E

0x0F7B6850
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x519EABBE
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0xB8ED6314

0x0F7B6850
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x3112B1F1

0x0F7B6850
"Nay; it was men's work."
0xC722171E

0x0F7B6850
"And what do the women do?"
0x3B8C4AA4

0x0F7B6850
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0xB4E583E7
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0xADC690A4

0x0F7B6850
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0xE5AF21E5
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xB10F4844
wanted.  I took leave.
0x49370B23

0x0F7B6850
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x2CA67678
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x7D97490A
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x6BCD7817
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0xEAF8727F
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0x53C982E3
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0xDBB28BA6
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0xDCC6F0E3
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x0115C38B
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x7D31DE9E
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x71E98566
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0xA5FC3A2C
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0xBD84A0ED
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0x1D3EF92B
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xBA150C12
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x1D242AB2
if a servant was wanted here?
0x2C29EAEA

0x0F7B6850
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0xAFA554F9

0x0F7B6850
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0x3119F27E
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0x69F5E55C
no matter what."
0xD06233A1

0x0F7B6850
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x2B53C5E9
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x824026F9
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x457FEA5C
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xF5C80FEC
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0x0F4477E3
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x0D25F93F

0x0F7B6850
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x9F9C3BB7
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x24DBD998
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0xD9651545
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0x592B8CF9
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x1B819E59
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0x67C57B39
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x637F238D

0x0F7B6850
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x86720480
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0xB7FBAE13
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0x84B36A48
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x262A379D
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0xC7FD7A32
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x085B61BE
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0x546D0A64
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xBE98D870
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xF4B6867F
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0x6398FE4F
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0xB89DFCEC
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0x227F6301
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0x9278C3A0
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0xB8C2ED3A
this the parsonage?
0x21B52A5D

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Was the clergyman in?"
0x33DF988C

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"Would he be in soon?"
0x0A2FDC7A

0x0F7B6850
"No, he was gone from home."
0x0DE0D189

0x0F7B6850
"To a distance?"
0x292F42AC

0x0F7B6850
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x5D545451
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xFDFDB142
there a fortnight longer."
0x1294BB6A

0x0F7B6850
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x758EE382

0x0F7B6850
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x0AB0FC26
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x07CED905
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0xDE3CE4E0

0x0F7B6850
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x8845CE1F
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0xC0D9E565
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x984574B9
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x20CF28B9
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0xE5D9D5C2
for this handkerchief?"
0xA65B1C0C

0x0F7B6850
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0x7BCE4E8C
that way."
0xE846516E

0x0F7B6850
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x32803D47
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x62252D60

0x0F7B6850
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x2AA33823

0x0F7B6850
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xD2F08ECE

0x0F7B6850
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0xB0410CC2
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0x3C8A3B0B
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x8A1641BE
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0xD7E03622
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x5DB9905B
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0xCBD22315
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xCB0AC016
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0xC6056839
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x87D521DA
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xDE0E6878
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x63EF703C
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0x426878B4
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0xD43A1B97
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x8FD6D5B8

0x0F7B6850
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0x65424551
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x39D5F9B5
said--
0xD489085A

0x0F7B6850
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x74D9CA16
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x48A7C2EA
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x3B5DA8F7
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x6E6E8ACE
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0xBBFFE4B2

0x0F7B6850
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xFF069AD6
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x19B1B9D3
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0xBFEE93F3
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xD48BC1D1
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0xA7F81FF3
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xB8D2E58E
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0x9CB1CCD5
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x3FDC0C5C
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x499B9B40
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x472098E1

0x0F7B6850
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x68CC96E8

0x0F7B6850
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xA4E43B80
give her these porridge."
0x5DBA6981

0x0F7B6850
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x70498340
pig doesn't want it."
0x9328CAA9

0x0F7B6850
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x81FD44BA
ravenously.
0xA7794EBE

0x0F7B6850
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x8338D5D3
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x8077CB7F

0x0F7B6850
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0xFB15F7B9
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0xDC28D84D
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0xB078DE66
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x57E74657
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0xFEBB4656
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xAB28EE3C
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x19CE524A
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0x78118C8D
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x4051C525
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0x7463D279
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x51517B73

0x0F7B6850
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x8DE367CA
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x0B274C3D
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x15F0CE63
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x4316AC39
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x9C1D4F9E
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x67F79E65

0x0F7B6850
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0xD1456AAC
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x0FD10E06
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0xC691F228
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x0D0EA697
grave."
0x10B2FB96

0x0F7B6850
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0xE4E7C367
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x04E074C5
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x152E86A9
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x10D461C6
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0x9418BC4B
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xE3998F9F
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x0AABA269

0x0F7B6850
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0x2D59D733
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0xCC208726
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0xC126B2B4
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x28E32DBB
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0xBDD211A7
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x2E069F10
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0xF78D1897
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x9B1315E3
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x23877C80
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xE606EE6C
it shut in my face."
0xDBAC9B0C

0x0F7B6850
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0xAF9F0BC0
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0xE0CD292A
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x9397621B
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0xA153A836
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x6BA86C5E
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x20A602C5
long.
0xE396FD58

0x0F7B6850
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x4ECBE798
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0xC1CBE070
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x41B786B6
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0x891293DF
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0x8B1F990D
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0xE5CB2059

0x0F7B6850
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0xFFF06B82
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x3C1A1113
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x6E0614D9
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x54D1CD04
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0xACDD15A4
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0xCB5C7671
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0xA4B669DB
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xB6EC6558
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0x76B6D085
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x9DF37A0C
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x98B76E83

0x0F7B6850
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0xE8EF5872
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x3422D487
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x32706CDB
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0xCB1D87B4
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x273C8970
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0xF3821C68
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0x6206C49E
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x5B7FC236
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xE866C0DD
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0xB8E2DE61
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0x41FB6729
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0x6B7DE222
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0xBAC23919
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x40605274
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x5E4AAC1C
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x142E3335
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x4169B71F

0x0F7B6850
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0xAC0ADF81
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x77CF7D60
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x224CE496
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0x33646D4F
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x64EB01C2
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x18D384A8
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x003B686D
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xCDB8970B

0x0F7B6850
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0xDF257BD7
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x83DC71A4
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0x6A98F99F
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0xD1A092CC
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x78B55D20
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x17C6F3A8
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0xDB33630E
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xE7FFFDAD
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0xB42B9292
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x836138A2
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0xD7D4A0F6
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0x2F692D02
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x58CD6B48
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x1E345959
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x23D682B6
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0xC0C68353

0x0F7B6850
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0xAB263E03
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xAC269D14
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x5680108C
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0xFCC9B965
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x373AB301
German I could not tell.
0xFF969E68

0x0F7B6850
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x1824612D
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x6A51DE82
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x5060654D
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x11A4EC52
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x098C1DDC
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xA0964442

0x0F7B6850
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x8CF63BD3
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x48FC8EDC
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x2BB334EA
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x279118E5
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0xB46276C4

0x0F7B6850
Both were again silent.
0x58E4AEBF

0x0F7B6850
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0x39BD371A
looking up from her knitting.
0xB46A8FDF

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0x9B51E1DC
other way."
0xE80EA487

0x0F7B6850
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x2CF64018
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x22FEC17B

0x0F7B6850
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0x34736829
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x598CEFF8
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0xC9D0A005

0x0F7B6850
"And what good does it do you?"
0x56F0F027

0x0F7B6850
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x898EAB17
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0xBC67E612

0x0F7B6850
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0xC87D152A

0x0F7B6850
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x9217AE26

0x0F7B6850
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0x92215F36
master but a lexicon."
0x8DFB7BAF

0x0F7B6850
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0x918B9334
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0xB70966D4

0x0F7B6850
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xF5C13D4C
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x7ACF5808
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xA6ECDFA7

0x0F7B6850
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x4898B257
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xBD9288EB

0x0F7B6850
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0xDBCA50F0
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x0E9D33ED

0x0F7B6850
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0xE78CF076
sad now.
0x4646C88B

0x0F7B6850
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0xD4EB55B1
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x9CEDD5DA

0x0F7B6850
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x035F26A3

0x0F7B6850
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0x7FA11CDC
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x070D1672
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0xF452031A
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xDF68C75D
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x6F3EA43D
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x8CD93C0E
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x18470795
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0xF4DABEE2
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x9D14F3F4
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0xF67F4726

0x0F7B6850
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x09FDDA4B
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x004384B5
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x647A15D6
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x691B1ED6
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xD4452847
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0xE4E31375
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x9B6FB98D

0x0F7B6850
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x91E98F90
St. John when he comes in."
0x94787569

0x0F7B6850
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0xF68484D3
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0xECC5A542
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0xD8B59D54
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x2E594082
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0xF5E48A38
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0x824B969A
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0xE7AFBDC3
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0xA400CB8D
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0xBBA0309F
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0xFF983B0C

0x0F7B6850
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0xF55CBFC2
me by the light of the candle she held.
0x4EEB9DEB

0x0F7B6850
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x1E538CAB

0x0F7B6850
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x2475396E
from?"
0x888FF61F

0x0F7B6850
"I am a stranger."
0x7027C5A1

0x0F7B6850
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x46B23CA4

0x0F7B6850
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0xB2BE2465
bread to eat."
0x7127C1C6

0x0F7B6850
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0xD98E1755
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x927FF4F8
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x91F0C1E3

0x0F7B6850
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xD16D0FB4

0x0F7B6850
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x1CC36F17
now; it looks very ill."
0xB82704C9

0x0F7B6850
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x7E8E4A6F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x984A0B3E
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x0961F0D7

0x0F7B6850
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0xACAB0E18
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0xBCC4B06E

0x0F7B6850
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x34D18386

0x0F7B6850
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x37DB0BE6

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0xD3503FBF
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x1F6E8FF3

0x0F7B6850
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0xEE38119D

0x0F7B6850
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x07D0F8EF
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x17921516
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0xD6ED0008
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0xBA14DCF2
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0xBD999945
bolted it within.
0xAA24EE6D

0x0F7B6850
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x2CC68754
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0x7CBACCB5
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x80EA476F
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0xDCE1159C
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x67717E76
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0xBF32AEE4
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x2536BB4D
endeavoured to regain.
0x2AEE6BD9

0x0F7B6850
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0xD947E912
will in silence."
0xF4D4E9DE

0x0F7B6850
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0xFF5051E5
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xFBFE87B7
and still.
0x426A14E1

0x0F7B6850
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0xFCF4541A
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0xDFF719B2
if you perished here of want."
0x0F12BB3A

0x0F7B6850
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x53F43E7E
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x7A763B0B
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0x16C38A86
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x253D3577
to the door.
0xFF6D8AB9

0x0F7B6850
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0xC987BC06

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0xB957F624

0x0F7B6850
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x9E48CC01
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0x52CDF27A
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x7AE65900
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0xD25468C5

0x0F7B6850
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0xA03B8170
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x76C1788F
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x852A5FE5
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0x97338169
house."
0xEAD611A8

0x0F7B6850
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x9ECE26A1

0x0F7B6850
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0xCC010C64
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x8771AB3E
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0x9CCC7CB8
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x1A67063D
me.
0x7F08C9A4

0x0F7B6850
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0x536C8EA7

0x0F7B6850
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0xA9FC0EF4

0x0F7B6850
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x1CFD7F76

0x0F7B6850
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x3EA2F71F
sit."
0x926598AB

0x0F7B6850
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0x99DB661B
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x57EA986A

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0xE4924B24
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xBF989065

0x0F7B6850
"A mere spectre!"
0x82DB582A

0x0F7B6850
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x633E9673

0x0F7B6850
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xF9761DAE
bread."
0x36761ADA

0x0F7B6850
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0xDE69F2A6
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x1CAB28A9
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x9EC05902
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x1798A6F0
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xB177089C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0xE05F5C0C
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x718D8326
first, eagerly soon.
0x75D95C7F

0x0F7B6850
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0xB72B1B37
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0xBA63351A

0x0F7B6850
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0xAADA050F

0x0F7B6850
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x8EE57B18
name."
0x6AE1754E

0x0F7B6850
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x636BED35
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0xEDF5AA59

0x0F7B6850
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0xEDA5413A

0x0F7B6850
I was silent.
0x881BF560

0x0F7B6850
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x83F23BDC

0x0F7B6850
I shook my head.
0xCA83D8ED

0x0F7B6850
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0xA4F91112

0x0F7B6850
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x20C6AF54
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xF0671C12
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xCA0DD199
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x1ED25E4F
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xE993A566
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x6846D928

0x0F7B6850
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x45157FBF

0x0F7B6850
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x82004DDA

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x24CADC00
took the word--
0x03C2045C

0x0F7B6850
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x814FC01D
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0xC37BFE3B

0x0F7B6850
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0xE726AC67
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x14578D63
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0x77C0F381
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x00E92F8B
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x8C01950C
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xCB647FB7
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x3D4D5ADA
silent.
0xE28B3678

0x0F7B6850
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0xEFCF5992
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x1B0687AE
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x20FDDCC6
matter over."
0x47560064

0x0F7B6850
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0xBED69079
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xE85E6CE1
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0x66949618
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xD7937815
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x0621B33F
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x5537FA2B
joy--and slept.
0x8D34A8C6

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXIX
0xC3C32C6D

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x1A703FB7
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0x3F723BC7
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0xEECDF832
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0x012E4BD4
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0xC4395187
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0xAF68EE89
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x318FC615
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x5CE0905F
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x31FC4D82
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x2AF2DE6C
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0xABAA2D58
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x1BF39646
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0x40A01BD8
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0x14D1AEB3
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x2866627A

0x0F7B6850
"It is very well we took her in."
0x86BCABA9

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0xB1AEDC27
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0xDA415693

0x0F7B6850
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0xB5582FCE

0x0F7B6850
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x015E09AE
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x713055C8
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x23EEF53C

0x0F7B6850
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0x2DDF942B
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x8309E8E8
would be agreeable."
0xAD297094

0x0F7B6850
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0x96476BCF
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0x34AE98A3
myself.  I was comforted.
0xC604A89B

0x0F7B6850
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x913515FC
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0x817286D7
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0xFFD7DBBC
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0x9E2D9E3F
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0xFC3AD66E
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0xFCC33DFB
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0xD919F6BA
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x81F277F6
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0xAE2CFD0E
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0xDDE73357

0x0F7B6850
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0xA5888BBE
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xF177A22C
her permanently."
0x6CD4FF70

0x0F7B6850
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x2974D68B
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xA551EBA7
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x0384F94D
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x0EEF8199
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0x547E91E6
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x240CB299

0x0F7B6850
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x550E8BFC

0x0F7B6850
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x1FD7F030
are quite wanting in those features."
0x497F5663

0x0F7B6850
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0x34CB2279
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0xEF09BF4D
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0x6937DDBF
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x647D5F50
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0xC958DC6A
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0xC7B52EE6
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0xA59B7533
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0xC8F41849
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x658E0E97

0x0F7B6850
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x81495A78
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xA6666341
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0x4358466C
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0xEB3D86F5
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0xC10024E7
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0xED7D7EB8
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x5B1AEE5A
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0xC9165577
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0xFBFBBCAF
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x7C3F4D62
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0x1A602930
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x46CBA61C

0x0F7B6850
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xA784A39F
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0x379EDFBF
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x8C9D5283
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x0A8821B0
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x7E182BCA
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0xF4C0AC8B
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0xE874A08E

0x0F7B6850
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x082E66AE
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x1FB78A72

0x0F7B6850
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x1CFC2EBB
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x87641635
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xDA0CCF96

0x0F7B6850
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0xB5C4C24F

0x0F7B6850
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0x54408B19
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xF0B6E76D
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x2BFFA121

0x0F7B6850
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0xC21C6349
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xE9AB2D70

0x0F7B6850
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x269A4642
nor no brass, I guess?"
0xBF37256E

0x0F7B6850
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x760A11F7
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x7685A85F

0x0F7B6850
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0xFA2EA863

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, very."
0x07CEA878

0x0F7B6850
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x5E054387

0x0F7B6850
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0xCE9B2259

0x0F7B6850
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0xCC60BD72

0x0F7B6850
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0xB2D9FC77
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x5E2AF122
basket of the fruit.
0x204701BC

0x0F7B6850
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x7B97B682

0x0F7B6850
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x6646484A

0x0F7B6850
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0xA74BA803

0x0F7B6850
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x145581E3

0x0F7B6850
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x4CFE15A7
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x5A7068AE

0x0F7B6850
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x20103164
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0xEFE159CA

0x0F7B6850
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0x9C36713D
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x8AA36677
are."
0xD99ADC78

0x0F7B6850
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x7C6C2DBC

0x0F7B6850
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0x25F5FF07

0x0F7B6850
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x7626648A
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xE26CEE29

0x0F7B6850
"That village a few miles off?
0x5ACFA972

0x0F7B6850
"Aye."
0xDBEE67E9

0x0F7B6850
"And what is he?"
0xDCCBC0D2

0x0F7B6850
"He is a parson."
0xA9ACD377

0x0F7B6850
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x30B98DF5
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x788E8DE6
residence?"
0xAEC02D7E

0x0F7B6850
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0xDE171B5D
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x197B9956

0x0F7B6850
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0xAE758740

0x0F7B6850
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0xA51DF178

0x0F7B6850
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0x36CB70F3

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Their father is dead?"
0xFB78E3F6

0x0F7B6850
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x19E62F24

0x0F7B6850
"They have no mother?"
0xE4344326

0x0F7B6850
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x76C97A7C

0x0F7B6850
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x50602BB6

0x0F7B6850
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0x53DBD618

0x0F7B6850
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x0BEAC325
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x4C16C2FF
beggar."
0xDF8EA890

0x0F7B6850
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0xD8925BC8
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0x915172D8
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0x0B9ACFC3

0x0F7B6850
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x902BE5C4
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x2769503F

0x0F7B6850
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0xF924BFF7
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x736E40F9
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0xF425546C

0x0F7B6850
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x3D368369

0x0F7B6850
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x4EEE0CA7

0x0F7B6850
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xBB945165
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x97AE3BA3
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xA8FDE470
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x6BA5012B
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0xF4B24951
to consider poverty a crime."
0x254AF68E

0x0F7B6850
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x879C28F4
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0x4CA730A1
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x41210012

0x0F7B6850
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0xEAA4895C

0x0F7B6850
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x145B77FF
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x28EF8998

0x0F7B6850
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0x4F822A50
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x25264480
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0xEADC0D85
the young people.
0x556D5965

0x0F7B6850
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x7955F319
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x358A067E
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x196208F1
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x9C18720A
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x33922E92
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0xD35F38F7
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x6BF29B9D
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x08459EDE
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0xB0482B8A
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x1BE73092
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0x7E0EB65A
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0xA4947219
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x3EF2AAE7
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0xFFE18EC1
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0x3E439205
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0xD048C4EA
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0xEFB01597
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x8913C0F9
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0xCD548B2A
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0xF6805281
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0xFC823380
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0xC39C47C2
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0xFFFDF348
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0x4B26AA32
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x14145908
for being united.
0x31F0B609

0x0F7B6850
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0xD6CE9E47
ladies and their brother were now.
0xC6FDB441

0x0F7B6850
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x82AD0496
to tea."
0xF3C25D0A

0x0F7B6850
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0xBB951C01
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x07D04034
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x0A6D7B79
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0x2954642E
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0xBC588440

0x0F7B6850
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xFA3C0FD4
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x1703B4FD

0x0F7B6850
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x7D766187
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x852C5E85
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0xC0560FA1
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x92DB80A3
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0xB55C0585
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xAE2D6948
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x8D3F7EFA
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x3BEC2E9F
will.
0xC68CA71C

0x0F7B6850
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0x1432FE99
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0xFE0B53ED
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x0567973E
parlour."
0xF1503BE4

0x0F7B6850
"I am very well here."
0x4E530907

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0xADAB178C

0x0F7B6850
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0xA3514678

0x0F7B6850
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x454DE07C
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0xC8DD1C35

0x0F7B6850
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x77C6FE09
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0xBF0836F7
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x8F536771
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0x400A3352

0x0F7B6850
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x567A48C9
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x4CAE2452
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x637B4D0C

0x0F7B6850
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0xA65C39BE
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0xABE9239C
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x177485EB
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x386E4E92
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x6EF0DDF4
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x2A69615F
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x3BFBF0CC
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0xC6A9CFFA
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x3841D34E
and well saved.
0x8899E032

0x0F7B6850
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0xE3F1313C
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xE927F1A5
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0xFA578FF1
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0xD467781A
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0xA1EAF412
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x99D81E2F
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0xA36CD7D9
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x5396EAC3
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x6857F9EB
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x7C608ECF
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0x9DBBC338
fair hair.
0x19EFF64B

0x0F7B6850
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x26C96589
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x3FD82800
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x4C1CC3F1
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0x9061FE29
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0xBADD4280
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0xFBF5EA99
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x2AC1A674
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0x2947E4CB
of the oven.
0xB238D4EB

0x0F7B6850
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0x99211C5C
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x6AA39CC3

0x0F7B6850
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x1892230E
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0xFC080265
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x77940BE8
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0xDFDC7F3B
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x86AA9F3E
from the stranger.
0x9ACE314D

0x0F7B6850
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x421F0E58

0x0F7B6850
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0x11B09376
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0xBDC1D8B4

0x0F7B6850
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x6BC5BAFD
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x4FB60C59
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0xC362AFCE
immoderately."
0x82898839

0x0F7B6850
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0xE3914C24
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x73F74D86

0x0F7B6850
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0xEB11508D
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0xA4D6543B

0x0F7B6850
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0x96EEF63C
absolutely without home and friends."
0xCB7DE0A2

0x0F7B6850
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x27E1F483
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0xCA5F447C
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0x65989D35
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0xA1F7F750
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x32548773
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x94518608
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x640F4F3A
to encourage.
0x9FD18CED

0x0F7B6850
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xB483A572
every connection?"
0x41788983

0x0F7B6850
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0xDB0EF5BE
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x920E3F75

0x0F7B6850
"A most singular position at your age!"
0x0542D827

0x0F7B6850
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0xF0B2FFDE
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0xBD8F8A1B
explained the quest.
0xB2AC251C

0x0F7B6850
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x5CD51A22

0x0F7B6850
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0xA79EE2EF
St. John," said she.
0xAC9EBA3D

0x0F7B6850
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x78FE7F89

0x0F7B6850
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x03AA6B5E
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x9A587C38
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0xDE213847
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x1CC9D58E
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x7EE0135E
out tears as well as colour.
0xB46F8B25

0x0F7B6850
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0xA9D16A50

0x0F7B6850
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x6F1A1D93
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x5A53AF2D
piercing look.
0x12C59D35

0x0F7B6850
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x83F2BE56
secret," I replied concisely.
0xCFFAEE34

0x0F7B6850
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0xCA6726A1
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x9024F93C

0x0F7B6850
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xABE96120
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0xF082AEF8

0x0F7B6850
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x4D4B3BA3
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0x3DE9770D
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0xE4449AF1

0x0F7B6850
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0x5942A4F2
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x02A9E290
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0xA4BE2887

0x0F7B6850
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x4D2DE48A
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0x9E0EB032
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0xD861563B

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x8724DE08
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x6BE935BD
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x2FC3761E
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0x5C23BC0D
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x39B02C91
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xBDD7686B
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xCCC49D11
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0xB260A903

0x0F7B6850
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0xA0632F2D
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0xBBEFE113
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x037D896B
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x04C30A49
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x4BCB7FD0
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0xA859F0C0

0x0F7B6850
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0x4BEF4CA9

0x0F7B6850
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x06DF0F75
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0xFE002205
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x4C44EC88
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x923E51E9
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xC54DEE4F
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0xA2DC0342
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x9D931BE8
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x085D97F4
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0xF4444248
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0x1F94270F
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0x8AB5BFA8
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x8526B1FA
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x2718DB09
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x9B121051
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xD95531EB
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x1C2F4B24
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0x3CDF32CC
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0xF89190A2
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0xCF977B3C
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x88DB5F78

0x0F7B6850
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0x2BC03DFB
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x78E038B9
down now, Miss Elliott."
0x31BCBA44

0x0F7B6850
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x2F992B38
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0xC570D166
once.
0xDA704655

0x0F7B6850
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x6B184371

0x0F7B6850
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x1C16E906
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0x53D5EA97
sounds strange to me."
0x22A2738D

0x0F7B6850
"Your real name you will not give?"
0x16F21065

0x0F7B6850
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0x10C72DBC
lead to it, I avoid."
0xF628E288

0x0F7B6850
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x95D2F3B8
be at peace a while."
0xEF5E31FB

0x0F7B6850
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0xE2D0EEE4
and with as much acumen as ever.
0xA0FBFE92

0x0F7B6850
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x3BE9DD6F
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0xD9079051
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x6D64BE90
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0x34A58686
us?"
0x67E927D8

0x0F7B6850
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0x09CA8A60
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x0057C4D3
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0xA407656F
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0x24BA1E45

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x654DC337
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x71207658
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0x8ABE8E8B

0x0F7B6850
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x40085C6D
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0x607804A8
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x7FE03815
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0x9F6E8602
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0x6C962026
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x4806A365
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0x6FDD335C
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x9D395407

0x0F7B6850
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x4C0F600C
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x4DC2B74E
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0xDD94756F

0x0F7B6850
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0x472EB61B
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0x28CB1E4D

0x0F7B6850
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x6E47B6A7
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x23042917

0x0F7B6850
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0x04FE6D4B
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x5B78DABB
present strength would permit.
0x665B4C5E

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXX
0x4954F6B3

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0xF3A53C52
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x89C0D79C
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0x3D938A0D
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0xF6A48B06
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x8D0FEC08
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0xCF93DC6A
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0xAFD4B453

0x0F7B6850
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x5E391F7F
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x8341CF19
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xBD7964EE
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x61DA0016
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0xD588656E
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0x4ABD8864
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0xC88528F9
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x4CD5CB31
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0xC8DAB04B
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0xEB30E56E
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x15D0A177
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0xC563BD5C
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0x7C536401
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x54441DF1
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x4F2D0BDD
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x754CF58B
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0x17EF4990
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0x16BA71C5
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x9802CE9F
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x6849C134
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x668ACC8B
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0xB0CE0F6A
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0x9A5FFD5F
that entranced theirs.
0x15570231

0x0F7B6850
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x6052C5EC
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0x5C10FD2F
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x00A8B46D
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x848B26B1
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x58A684A6
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0x660446C6

0x0F7B6850
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0x5069F515
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x9C1EE8ED
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0x3D65CC90
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x13D671D5
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x7C3FF3F9
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0xBE056BA1
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x8DFAA98A
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0xFBC870F9
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xEF472E2F
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x825CA65E
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0xF8090F60
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x241C7D8B
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0xBF33CB9B
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0xA2E52EC4
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0x7CE9524E
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xB4C2D2EC
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0x2C363549

0x0F7B6850
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0xF5B3DE7E
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0xC3D1127E
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x832723F1
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x020B0103
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0xB5B8C31B

0x0F7B6850
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x60ECC76C
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x89A75A63
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x8533418D
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0x3FBD5FB9
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x648B7CE8
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x6722C73A
cheerful--
0xB397F7B6

0x0F7B6850
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x7ED2BDB9
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x05557331
propose to myself?"
0x9380092B

0x0F7B6850
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x8D184BF3
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0x9AFAB2FB

0x0F7B6850
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x8BD3B3FC
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x7814A78C
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x9117C0FA
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x3C39128A
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0xF9AA6422
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x5AE7C7A7
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0xE1126ACF
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0x384ECCDC
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0xAFE64024
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x7D481D07

0x0F7B6850
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xBF40B444
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0xDD53BB5B
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x642529C0
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0xC837ADCF
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x4A7B0A8A
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x5AEC877A
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x0102137A
delights they could yield.
0x9645972B

0x0F7B6850
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x2BB626A6
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x830F1E2C
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xCA54F91E
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x8EA73A13
produced on me.
0x74AFE067

0x0F7B6850
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x32EF5040
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0xD40F1B98
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x9084D453
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x833DB484
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x3950D723
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0x73CE629D
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x8A9A2D9C
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0xF6320F20
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0x6FA3495D
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x5AC037C4
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x8D680DC9
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x10C08657
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x01F5525C
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0xC773D791
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xDD8B947C
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0xEC7DAAC0
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x5621C9C0
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xC1713276
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xB45377F0
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x46DABA9C

0x0F7B6850
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x20D68A3F
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0xDF8422B4
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0xD1BAC3CC
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x0E618F43
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0xD1DC1D51
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x82307A28
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x03ECFE4C
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0xFB2AD6F7
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x42A2D13F
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xF70A7BA7
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x52D680C9
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0x8CA50AF4
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0xB1BED187
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x6950085D
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x60FECBA5
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0x600E9496

0x0F7B6850
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x3CF54C30

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x3D86B228
myself to undertake?"
0x0679AC9C

0x0F7B6850
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x794571A8
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x60DB7E04
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0xA1118F36
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x80993D46
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x130DD56B

0x0F7B6850
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0xCD85F6FD

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0xDA37D2B1
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0xDC9B1D36

0x0F7B6850
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x54F842E9
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x40B10C52
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0xB5350C5F
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0xF3818A24
interest to me.
0xE4CC184D

0x0F7B6850
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x8CCAD700
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0xB395633F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x52E74116
you to accept."
0x73DA4A93

0x0F7B6850
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0xCC1A44FD
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0xB18610D6
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x5DAC4663
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x49EA224F

0x0F7B6850
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xC060FE93
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x5000185B
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x8652BAB2
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xFB56F0E9
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x611567CD
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0xE03F8949
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x3CFA5196
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xA668282E
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x35C652E7
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x9CC34E68
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0xF6F0C481
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0xE142001E
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x0B15E94A
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0xC68229C9
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0xAC389E5A

0x0F7B6850
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0xB6A2F530
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xE329E468
glance.  He resumed--
0x7333ED70

0x0F7B6850
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0xB45A4BD4
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x98249365
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x589E9138
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x0935A452
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x97223D36
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x451028CD
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x671BE240
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0xE5AABEE9
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0xC4D91863
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0x8E2D0C10

0x0F7B6850
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x64574C27

0x0F7B6850
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x83CC845B
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x3DA68AB7
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x1D658E3D
succeeding observations.
0x5597CBA8

0x0F7B6850
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x7383C8E2
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x8496E809
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0x0CAC848B
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0xE2D390D5
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x2DE80007

0x0F7B6850
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0x69BAAC2D

0x0F7B6850
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x02B5B480
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0xA1F53029
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0xC0C28376
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0x41AF28FA
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0xFE66E7CE
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x04434430
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0xD5F7FF96
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x55177DF8
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xB10743DF
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x12CE5074
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xA88C0D2D
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x85523AC4
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x42F53222
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x34062FE4
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xA3AF1534
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x768762EE
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0xEB8AC604

0x0F7B6850
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x01E4738C
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0x4A14CE7F
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x4070A4FC
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x2E91950A
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xDE169807
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0x29DCF774
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x2ED000E4
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0x77A645C0
decision.
0x32E69BBD

0x0F7B6850
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x540BB688
heart."
0xFB0FFCB2

0x0F7B6850
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x14B17C87
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x26221CFA
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0xA081BB70
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x76E830E3
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0x9BF82677

0x0F7B6850
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0xFE80E33B

0x0F7B6850
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x753C7F91

0x0F7B6850
"I do."
0x22F36D12

0x0F7B6850
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xEEB89C73
deeply gratified.
0xCDCB5179

0x0F7B6850
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0x06A72ECC

0x0F7B6850
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0xAB62D4C1
week."
0x446D10F6

0x0F7B6850
"Very well: so be it."
0x87530596

0x0F7B6850
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0xBF4B3BC1
me.  He shook his head.
0x89A5500D

0x0F7B6850
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x855C0921

0x0F7B6850
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0x4BE581C1

0x0F7B6850
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x4A9B4E5E

0x0F7B6850
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x55EC9923
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x050846D2

0x0F7B6850
"I am not ambitious."
0x8834CF72

0x0F7B6850
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x4F0A1639
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0xE1B406E6
it out?"
0x659159B3

0x0F7B6850
"I was speaking of myself."
0xCEB94B3A

0x0F7B6850
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x90F6B096

0x0F7B6850
"What?"
0x38A2F2D9

0x0F7B6850
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0xEEA52EE8
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xB94FC546
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0xF6897F1D
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0xB75E50CC
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0xF2872FBF
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x19885FFB
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x75417C11
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0xB49AA84E
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0x5CF39139
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0x517AD468
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xE0D1FA3B
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xD53A1B9D
some means."
0x4712886B

0x0F7B6850
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x47C55148
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x15DF0B11

0x0F7B6850
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x61C3B1BB
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x7E1AEC26
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0xE8032705
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x6BB72B9E
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x28208D84
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0xC69F7E4E
parting for life.
0xF98FA8C4

0x0F7B6850
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x799F2710
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x65A93C35
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0x458E52B5
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x0B86893D
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0xA7D5DC31
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x08FB72EA
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x63C692F7
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0xAB89FA88

0x0F7B6850
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0x7C8FFA22
she murmured.
0x17ADD995

0x0F7B6850
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x70DCCF7D
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x91272696
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0x8DF1D73F
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0xD789F20C
letter.  He entered.
0x714D39AD

0x0F7B6850
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0x2133B3DE

0x0F7B6850
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x2B7D1982
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x6CF64610

0x0F7B6850
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x0576FEC9

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xC8012D67
demanded, in a low voice.
0xA8258B2E

0x0F7B6850
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0xD7D7E56E
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0xDABCE156

0x0F7B6850
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x924C9A91
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xC5491348
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x89487089
enough.
0x7C56E388

0x0F7B6850
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0xCE1AF0FB

0x0F7B6850
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0xA1A1A0E5
Mary.
0x61836B33

0x0F7B6850
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x33A36AFC
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x2C39B1F3
what _is_."
0x72049AC9

0x0F7B6850
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x1D7FAAF2

0x0F7B6850
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0x7A0C9571

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x1762EA16
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0xAF66A4BD
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x1BA7EF6C
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x02BB81E1
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x9A9FCA6A
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xCC2A10FE
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x2AD68C35
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0xD15063A2
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0xD4926008
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0xB07D5442
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0xBCE34570
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x1E25FC52
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0x3C70BCB5
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x5F15C528
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0xB8434E13
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x810F64E0
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x706C139A
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0xD21928B0
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x927BB5DB

0x0F7B6850
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x3F7305D3
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xA2971401
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0x5AFAB12E
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x8F1E97BB
and so the old grange was abandoned.
0x1299C7A4

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXXI
0x9A2CF4AB

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0xCF3A63AD
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x4BB2BDD0
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x016E4992
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x6B20FE30
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x05564225
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x0B664CB3
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x3EB9B2C9
things as are necessary.
0x1957FC28

0x0F7B6850
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x894101BF
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x165CE8A7
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x83FE559C
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x26861F80
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0xE95980A9
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x8F42C124
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0xE6B3D250
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x2A06B5FD
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0x31EA28DD
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x7843ED4B
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xCCEB6C41
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x29C34EC1
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x4BCC8BFD
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xDBF31B17
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0xE241256D
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x3FB767F6
on from day to day.
0xE6DABDC1

0x0F7B6850
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xA5651BDA
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x6FBAB2F2
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0x8C341336
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0xD8D261B1
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x1C3AD66B
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x8354C745
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0xD5095EAB
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x762FCF5C
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0xCA56C3D0
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x677E9E38
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xB3C63D58
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0xCDF9EF9C
gratification for disgust.
0xCB1BB312

0x0F7B6850
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0x374D6A83
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xC91D4A2C
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0xFF6672EF
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x7128CED4
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0xD0DBE083
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xD0A6EA6E
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x5E054641
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x09CB3C01
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0xEE3D9256
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x882B4DE6
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x7D5CBBFF
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x49B766DE
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0xCB151D42
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0x1C95CC0E
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0xC4CC5B89
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0xF46CCF65

0x0F7B6850
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x68A77E3A
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0xF4B8509C
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x6A94EF14

0x0F7B6850
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0xA03FCC43
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xEBA688EC
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x418A72BE
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0xCEA5D0C7

0x0F7B6850
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0xADDAD7B0

0x0F7B6850
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x802CBC00
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x345A9F75
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xC5E02670
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x1E260F03
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0xA3BF1D69
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x34DDF3E7
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0xF0A04AC6
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xE7B8A21B
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x6E449E9A
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x86E69BD3
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x8C6CC2B1
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x4C9442A5
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x8CC352D2
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x9C0CB82F
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x870DA986
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x44C62585

0x0F7B6850
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0xD0B89EBF
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0xD7C5E7CE

0x0F7B6850
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0xBFB5BFFA
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0xD528720B
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x36B6B760

0x0F7B6850
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0xF630F5F7
asked.
0x1173F843

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0x3183BF0F
scholars very well."
0x38085C71

0x0F7B6850
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0xD5BE728C
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x65A95E74
I interrupted--
0x2DD8811C

0x0F7B6850
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x52E661B3
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x1182AAD4
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x013DC94A
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0x01D01D8F
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0x958451EB
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0xDF8CF284
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x0EA9E9D1

0x0F7B6850
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x44AB8D02
is dark and empty."
0x2439B84E

0x0F7B6850
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0xDD6DCC1F
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x21343165

0x0F7B6850
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x57666869
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x2B4B961E
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x75B09B39
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x05D3C189
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0xBD143D53
steadily, for some months at least."
0x7A6D6F3B

0x0F7B6850
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x3E87651F

0x0F7B6850
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0xF0566C46
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xED478146
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x732B34B4
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xA7A404FF
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0xBF5E9454
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xF16E030C
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x274C649F
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x0096874B
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x82688FAB
rougher than it.
0xD0C4BEC4

0x0F7B6850
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0xC0E14CF5
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0x1FEF62A7
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0xA263AA5F
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0xC20E761E
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x8D2C8836
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x7FEEEA88
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0xE1875351
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x9E7F5381
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x7ED9EAAE
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x0E8353FA
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xFE77E68E
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0x835EA69A
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x8A59CC60
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x68D9DBB1
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x94A5016C

0x0F7B6850
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0xC16A300E
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x90F6CF50
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x723FFD13
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x0CAF712F
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0xDA8FE12F
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0xAE27126E
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x624D21A0
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0x8CD558EC
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x7D9F38C3

0x0F7B6850
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x10208F52
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0xF5A07EF7
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x612A77B5
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x415F1831
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xA76F559F
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x405AA4F2
exclaimed--
0x2DF0E703

0x0F7B6850
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x59837ABA
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x606EB32C
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xDA02E6BE
your back towards me now."
0xEB04EC6D

0x0F7B6850
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x94E64F7F
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xD39DA1F1
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x2DF61CCB
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x18EA1C3F
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x1B786735
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0x12676B33
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0xB97CA4DE
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x7A54A6ED
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x69814E27
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0xAE424C9A
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0x0311914F
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xDC5E3916
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x947F2439
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0x322CE62D
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x81B86B1B
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0x2B3878CB
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0xB6E1B2E2
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x5D4CBDC1
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0xCFB1811C
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x069759CD
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x3473BF13
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x61420EDA
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x46C150C8
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x7706D9A6
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0xABDA40EF
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0xCC988D4A
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xCA508E02

0x0F7B6850
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0xB1A215D7
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x70E96131
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0xFE515D7C
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x2D196304
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0xAC788A5E

0x0F7B6850
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x9E56CD26
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0xCDA43470

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xEBB10EA0
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0xD8B86087
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x731F47A2
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0xD2ACDEA4
pointing to me.
0x2F9D8065

0x0F7B6850
"It is," said St. John.
0xE4F97AE8

0x0F7B6850
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x0149C386
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x2DEE2368

0x0F7B6850
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0x9022EC7E

0x0F7B6850
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0xE421EF11

0x0F7B6850
"Quite."
0x2E71B08B

0x0F7B6850
"Do you like your house?"
0x44A108E2

0x0F7B6850
"Very much."
0x7DDF25E2

0x0F7B6850
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0xEFFE97F0

0x0F7B6850
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x84740DC3

0x0F7B6850
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x45BA7394

0x0F7B6850
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x7F24C561
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x97210EE0
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0xAA465278
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0x28754649

0x0F7B6850
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0x2E58E684
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x26427C8E
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x3B2364EB
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x5E221DF8
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0x41A1DCCC
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x36C66066
merchants to shame."
0x99FED9DE

0x0F7B6850
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x02DB44A5
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x4CC3D5DF
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0xDB190899
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xA4FD22B4
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x0EA05B0A
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0xF9083534
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0x0A0422A3

0x0F7B6850
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x3E0D2FC8
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x7EA2A7C5
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xC29511FF

0x0F7B6850
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x09DFED7C
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0xA6A6000F
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0x2E43CFA5
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0xCC7045C8
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0xD5DA8D59
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0xBEEC7AA8
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x87981B70
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0x9F843B50
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x99307402

0x0F7B6850
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x1B6C536C
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0xC77E150A
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x091CF122

0x0F7B6850
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0xFF305B68
John.
0xDA8DC34D

0x0F7B6850
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x0E614468
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x1F89FE33
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0x87B5A856
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xA3D7DB22
her own.
0x697B9AAC

0x0F7B6850
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xC9C7EDB3
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0x5EB580A0
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x2F08CC11
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0xD4885719
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x29F84EFD
papa."
0xD79467FB

0x0F7B6850
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x304130E7

0x0F7B6850
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x8F1E31C9
it cost him thus to refuse.
0xC246CA90

0x0F7B6850
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0x56C70106
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x90E4C7BB

0x0F7B6850
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0xA6A4A5EA
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x3F3B8772
returned.
0x48757F94

0x0F7B6850
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x7F4CBB52
blanched as her gown.
0xEEE7F584

0x0F7B6850
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x2B765F7E
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x43BEB643
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x26505D97
at all.
0xD46E8261

0x0F7B6850
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0xA95C0D5B
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0x4BD94BEC
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.
0x2D2D700C

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXXII
0x5B343C03

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x7FB97572
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x59318544
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0xA5200BE4
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0x4EC53A57
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x5504F751
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x775D6814
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0x7A1289B4
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x9C633A20
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0xD864599D
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0xC55AB194
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x191D4F5A
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0xC6031BF2
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x6504EA1E
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x0E20CAA0
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0x7520CA34
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x71DA6A10
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0xD7869AD5
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0xC6540963
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x61D5830D
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x1DF7A9E7
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x69A98577
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0xEEADEBE7
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0xAF43B593
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x3C8B6347
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0x3E199313
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0x9C6F7DA0
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0xFCD9B33A
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0x242A2349
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xDCF2FEA6
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x16FBB689

0x0F7B6850
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x9D4F124D
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0xDF44B797
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x34CBCC52
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x82060EE7
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0xA9E96E0E
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0xF819DD8D
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xA69DB48D
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x6E4A3393
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x969DCA14
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x5DB52947
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x5EF263AF
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x00668465
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x70AF5F6F
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x93C4F7E5
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0xDC2FB9FC
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0xCAA3FC87
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0xD88E3DF0
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0xDFB22CF4
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0xF4DEBC4D
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xC33D6D5F
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x75B6C650
duties of the day.
0x3D405CC2

0x0F7B6850
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xCCFD21D2
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x7F1EC3DA
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0xF67676C7
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x5EE033BA
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0xA9F327AC
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0x6DEE4962
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x3992D3D4
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0xEC65C0FE
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x8226CFD0
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xED9090EC
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0xBB8000A3
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x4E434BBB
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x2AC22896
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x8B94F465
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0xD90F2BB1
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x0BB5BE33

0x0F7B6850
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x2D53E010
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0xADC788BE
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x3E88B41F
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x27560C78
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x53F310DB
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x31B08328
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0xBB9936AF
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xDED62CE3
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0xC1C844D2

0x0F7B6850
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0xDD612BA3
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0x2EB65747
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x8C0ACECF
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xA598675B
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0xB9320F22
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0xC6E6FBAF
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0xE07A1A41
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x32500163
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x4C8895EA
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x420A5AA0
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0xADDBA0A8
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xCE54BE44

0x0F7B6850
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x4AD0A0F0
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x6E605823
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0x293B773B
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xF9E038B4
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0xFE646326
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0xC9442683
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xD5F83519
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x02B94123
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x0E31B02A
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x1CC44813
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x451BB4E6
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xED0C197F
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0xBB41C7A6
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0xFB4D0A1B
acquaintance.
0x331F0524

0x0F7B6850
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0x643D58CA
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x565E109A
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x0D670F1C
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0xF167D924
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0xFCE0BD39
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xA13923F1

0x0F7B6850
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x4FFD2E8D
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x8C9B1D33
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0xC295CE77
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0xBB0AC933
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0xECE52295
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x104FADCE
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x0D30C8B6
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0x61E9F9EF

0x0F7B6850
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x281A3E18
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x3F3DA07F
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0xE6D61067

0x0F7B6850
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x2A9A7691
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0x2464BA4E
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0xDBBAF542
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x8588AD0C
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0xB82AE927
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0x9915AA19
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x4EE6B3EE
day.
0x7882C33C

0x0F7B6850
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0x5A4CF2B9
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xA3F23D8E
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0x5EA0E632
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x08A44DB8
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x0304ED25
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x61F94755
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x25E71470
Hall.
0x65262043

0x0F7B6850
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0x99CEB66E
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0xFBDAEAF7
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x7D88BAC3
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0x39281446
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x2262AF6F
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x76065B2D
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0xFDA1D8EA

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0x0B741E2F
high family, papa."
0x564E81FB

0x0F7B6850
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x7398CEA5
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0x0A435522
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x576F6525
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xD1F9456A
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xFCC01C15
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x1F1D5577
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xA2747EFC
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0xFB9045E7
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x90111582
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x8BAEE6BF
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x08C4D265
compensation for the want of fortune.
0x630A5A9E

0x0F7B6850
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xBB1D93F6
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x6DE51DB2
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0xE84058D7
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0xC31C012C
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x5D5E203D

0x0F7B6850
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0xACEEBF90
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x4423D603
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x043992E2
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0xD9DA27D9
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0xA002DD51
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0xC11C53BB
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0x8BA90D8F
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0xE69E4BA1
Rivers.
0x728CEC9A

0x0F7B6850
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0xEFB7BC09
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0xDF6BFEEB
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0x1E55211D
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0x7FEEC05D
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0xBC2D254E
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x298999C1
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x83694D35
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0xF70DEC7D
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xACE6B4BD
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0xBB5F7284
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x9F89D6C5
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0xDF6C9C00
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x31341EE8
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0x7F48E380
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0xD866A71F
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0x385769FA

0x0F7B6850
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x5D4A24E9
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x31899C93
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xCE35A9B3
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x83D9360C
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0xA274600D
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xC5BE95B2
him some good, if I could.
0x8B87551C

0x0F7B6850
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xD68FABCC
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x258BF3E9
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0xDA2A2706
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0xA1368B9F
him talk."
0x0037455E

0x0F7B6850
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x129A0779
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x7F1C43E2
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0xF2353772
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x55993E75
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x9F4408C8
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x11DA86BE

0x0F7B6850
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0xF4526591

0x0F7B6850
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xEEC03D78

0x0F7B6850
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x0E503E24

0x0F7B6850
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x11F1DE35
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0x030A5825
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xF5863D92
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0xB58D6C7E
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xE444B1B9
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xBD445730

0x0F7B6850
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0xF79B8D50
graceful and correct drawing."
0xBDBA1B9F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x7FB6883C
like?"
0xB3EC0313

0x0F7B6850
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0x20F0754F

0x0F7B6850
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x2CF7FD71
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x2EBC12A2
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0xB8F53BDF
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x0B955DF6
deem worthless."
0x2519F2ED

0x0F7B6850
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0xD7350AE5
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0xE7CE885C
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0xF962E534
smiles!"
0xA35E5F15

0x0F7B6850
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x133D10E9
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0x741C1263
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x497F8D25
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0xF7B34E71

0x0F7B6850
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0xDB951EEE
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0xC4BFA05C

0x0F7B6850
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0x46D55935
or wise is another question."
0x13CB0BD8

0x0F7B6850
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x82928451
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0xA8D7706F
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x0C416377
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x59286949
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0x26AA12DB
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x0C0C6140
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0xF4090BFD

0x0F7B6850
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x9A50FAE1
take to yourself the original at once."
0x5804A35A

0x0F7B6850
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x6F2D0F8B
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0xA4E4FE6E
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x0D23912F
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0xE6C4FC88
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xEBEE3E49
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x446EE25C
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x54AE8B95
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0xD0B12320
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x051D6B64
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x20B3B569

0x0F7B6850
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x5FE663F8
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xC85F18AC
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x32FFDF34
ought to marry her."
0x49AEE49E

0x0F7B6850
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0xC68D9ABA

0x0F7B6850
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x20CEBE12
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0xFCD603D0
often."
0xD3BC58AB

0x0F7B6850
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0xDCAB0AE0
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xD5121556
the table to measure the time.
0xCA4110C9

0x0F7B6850
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x33125A07
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x6BEBFC62
fetter your heart?"
0x03C2BE4C

0x0F7B6850
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x731A2550
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0xDE92C97C
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x92C1B207
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x8F0950E1
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0xBF7B40A8
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x6D79780D
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x2ADC8DED
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x7F196AAC
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x156BB3D2
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x94488D33
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0x96ABBB26
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0xECD69A05
time I marked pass in peace."
0x62B6A1D8

0x0F7B6850
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x7A081D90
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0x6B79A962
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x31277159

0x0F7B6850
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0x5F6E2BAB
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x6766FFAC
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x883C3840
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0xE814D55B
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x5D068015

0x0F7B6850
I gazed at him in wonder.
0xDF2D0EBD

0x0F7B6850
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x43AEFDE8
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x3F05D062
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0xC8464157
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x33B884BC
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0xEB1874B5
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x01B73C24
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x2DE5A003

0x0F7B6850
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0x04C141AC

0x0F7B6850
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0xF68238F3
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x705F1705
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xE1F429E2
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x05020D7A
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x9013CD00

0x0F7B6850
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xC71E6C83

0x0F7B6850
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x8FB4BF32
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0xF670B90F
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x76ECF048
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xB4E5BEF2
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x8C10E09D
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0xF832D129
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0xC0828FD7
live for."
0xA2C40E44

0x0F7B6850
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0xDB1055A6
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x521F06ED

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0xA5D2F178
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x13814DDE
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x345AA140
should do."
0xA9C0F169

0x0F7B6850
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0x7FA65B92
wasting away."
0xDCBC08BF

0x0F7B6850
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x0FEFFD02
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0xB1CDEA57
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x05E315F9
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xD67D7761
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0xBAEDB4C4

0x0F7B6850
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0xA5E6F30F
schoolroom."
0x59B99A3C

0x0F7B6850
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x3AD766C3
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0xB9F0FAB8
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0xB3F72568
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0x8E250273
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x6327C9B7
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x89BCC9C2

0x0F7B6850
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0xE162D5E1
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0x241E23CE
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xC1FD69CC
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x36C04FDF
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x32B1AEC5
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x9A9275DA
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x00E2D21F
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0xC093223B
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x563C7377

0x0F7B6850
I smiled incredulously.
0x4B5067AC

0x0F7B6850
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x88D910A2
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x3F886EA6
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x59F1627F
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0xD3E6060A
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x4DAFF00A
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0x0538DD14
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x1778B4F8
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0xC5B40669
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x22C068E5
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x1F2109E2
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x930E3759
still suffer."
0x5B4724EE

0x0F7B6850
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x33BBB9BD

0x0F7B6850
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x91D8B82B
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x6BECCFBA
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0xD6AAFB2D
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0xA8467F34
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0xF60D1BC2
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x7136429D
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x6D7DC7DC
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xCEB01023
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x73C8D252
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x125EDBCF
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x1FBD5C7D
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0xCCFA3E20
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x02C4934A
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x1F18DF9A

0x0F7B6850
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0xFC627FD9
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x1831A345

0x0F7B6850
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x93D9EC44
World, indeed!"
0x917B746F

0x0F7B6850
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x04E4A685

0x0F7B6850
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x41B6A316

0x0F7B6850
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x5E1BB64C
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0xE9ECF768
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x88E03E95
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x1C6EAD00
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0x2F8DFF3F
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0xFA7D30D0
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0xD1A53226
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0x2F32CB9A
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x1B3586B2

0x0F7B6850
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x02EB48E3

0x0F7B6850
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0xF04B8BC2
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0xBEC12336
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x0F3543F5

0x0F7B6850
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xC8D1BABD
globe, however!"
0xFF3D91D6

0x0F7B6850
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0xAC0C6107
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x5EDB06C7
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x289A8627
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x886F7597
forgot it.
0x14F7F52A

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXXIII
0xB4425351

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x94383AFE
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x100D7828
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x880E2BFF
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x1811ED10
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x9A2C566F
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xC7E2656A
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0x5985905D

0x0F7B6850
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0xD2A9D672
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x9FE86DDF
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x97C29071
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xD9E67AAC
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0xD2C08FF5
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x28B4F534

0x0F7B6850
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x44510533

0x0F7B6850
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0xF66D76D2
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0x2D243062
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0x128FC336
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0xE6F45EE8
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0xB7B0A9B5
vale that night.
0xC36EFA38

0x0F7B6850
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0xD006E2BA

0x0F7B6850
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0xDF233D73
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x4ED2460B
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xE6CC2B41
boots.
0x4CB3BC10

0x0F7B6850
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x153E8C39
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x450CC842
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0xD95E0FB9
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xEC5957D9

0x0F7B6850
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x6AD3C5A3

0x0F7B6850
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0xB4042803
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x9B5B5979
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x3992FF97
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x9CA91BF5
impatient to hear the sequel."
0xD2A90AAB

0x0F7B6850
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x91BE0593
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x9E6DA140
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x5AB386CE
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x1064CA82
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x7CE8B704
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0x13D9F7D1
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0xE5478D37
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0x5D862C31
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x03B513AA
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xEA1C30DA
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x61ECC519

0x0F7B6850
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0xD8F89943
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xC0B7894A
health."
0xFA25C97F

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x1D66AE42
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x45015BD6

0x0F7B6850
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0x74B3EE5B
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x9F37E746
silenced.
0x6BFD4414

0x0F7B6850
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x36BF8FF5
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0xECDF17A2
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x508EFE29
was behind him.
0xEBFDB58B

0x0F7B6850
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0xB65D0575

0x0F7B6850
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x7D554468
alone now, and return to my book."
0xC8FECA92

0x0F7B6850
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x9A88E1E5
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x4D07A819
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x47A6E1B4
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x613A5CAF
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x444C8581
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0xC97107E5
I would.
0xCDDB3222

0x0F7B6850
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0xC77D5736

0x0F7B6850
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0xD5C7A072

0x0F7B6850
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xE22AF2C5
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xAC220D03

0x0F7B6850
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x71DB7FC7
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x107F486E
and my scholars.
0xC3630439

0x0F7B6850
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x53B80110
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0xD8775221
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x6B64C2E6

0x0F7B6850
"Indeed!"
0x1AC58BFD

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x37A9458E

0x0F7B6850
"Does he?"
0xFF165A36

0x0F7B6850
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x176A0270

0x0F7B6850
"I know."
0x1CBBD4AB

0x0F7B6850
"Was it your suggestion?"
0xAB72527A

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"Whose, then?"
0x2747E515

0x0F7B6850
"His daughter's, I think."
0x2A4DB029

0x0F7B6850
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x926EEB5E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x326FB7FA
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x6425B228

0x0F7B6850
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0xBB4EAF27

0x0F7B6850
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0x2C9D624F

0x0F7B6850
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0xE11EDF33
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x80C706CE
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0xAB12ABD5
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0xA195CC15
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x62E1B9EB
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x26C3AE9D
trite or novel, it is short.
0x54D07276

0x0F7B6850
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x4A6DD5D5
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x777C41A3
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x15910E3A
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x6C3A6CFA
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x82F53598
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0xDDD6FF44
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xFB60B736
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xB6A23011
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0x9E85FF33
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0x8DED8585
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0x3662E921
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x202D892B
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xDA711E4C
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xE7C05604
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x7A7B80EF
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x0873009F
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0xD6C7EC48
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0xB6F52CA0
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0xD726C2CD
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x27C69A3C
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0xB5AD3B95
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x4B8DA0D2
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0xEF4906D0
Rochester."
0xCCFD8990

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0xD6D33E1D

0x0F7B6850
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0x76CD2982
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x460C7A61
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xE20CA74F
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x4E673324
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0xA626F73E
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0xCE2FF96E
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xA9EAFE27
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0x7795F4D8
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x14A344D4
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x9BC3178F
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0xDD8EF00D
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0xC287C11E
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x3A38117F
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x391A95F4
odd tale?"
0xEE9B00A5

0x0F7B6850
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x581DF442
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x21BEE111
doing?  Is he well?"
0xCB2C638A

0x0F7B6850
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0xC82D38E4
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0xE8BB00C5
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xE2C00344
which requires her appearance."
0x56548385

0x0F7B6850
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0xF163A965

0x0F7B6850
"I suppose not."
0x3136E206

0x0F7B6850
"But they wrote to him?"
0xFF713354

0x0F7B6850
"Of course."
0x9B41301F

0x0F7B6850
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0xE4D4CD83

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0xF9E9645F
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0x76726BB0

0x0F7B6850
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x158ADE8F
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xEBBB02A6
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x6CCE0924
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0x4C5716DD
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x432ECD89
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0xBB035A3C

0x0F7B6850
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x87A52B34

0x0F7B6850
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0xE0CE8D2A
warmth.
0x040F1AA5

0x0F7B6850
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x224125E7
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x0804CB4C
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x3C7C57CA
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x22613ED9
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xFD687371

0x0F7B6850
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x71557EC3
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xA11AED52
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x353EF472
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x1DA56AE3
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x4246F750
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x0F44A71B
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0x3C16E9D1

0x0F7B6850
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0x57AE8E6E
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0x0D7433B7
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x1EEAE4DF
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x1C5A1592

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x4F130321
Rochester than you do."
0x85B91E69

0x0F7B6850
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0x0E90C4DE
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0xD5482FA9
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0xB0B79DFB
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x14B820A0

0x0F7B6850
"Well, what did he want?"
0xCDE00165

0x0F7B6850
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0xF308C9AF
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0xED38831E
that--nothing more."
0xEF28E8E8

0x0F7B6850
"I!--rich?"
0x00B4F28E

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0xC77929E1

0x0F7B6850
Silence succeeded.
0x71C34C41

0x0F7B6850
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x9E80D3F3
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0x5CF51177
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0xCA405FB5
will and the necessary documents."
0xBCD4709F

0x0F7B6850
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x8B2A5F2A
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0x8999F2E5
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x8AB553BF
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x9FDA8E28
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0x3D7E0CFE
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x58B8EE3B
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0xEB2ECA91
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0xAC6CD657
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0xDB9A01D2
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0xF5264488

0x0F7B6850
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x75C72B7D
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0xC1671E68
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0xADCD64F3
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0xF5BF9B80
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0x75736BDA
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x62765769
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0xFD8701CB

0x0F7B6850
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0xE9EEB623
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x61E64F8B
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x62D5296F

0x0F7B6850
"How much am I worth?"
0xD64E07CF

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0xDC8DC224
think they say--but what is that?"
0xD7E2871B

0x0F7B6850
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0xB022C7B5

0x0F7B6850
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x4B0A8A9B
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0x1F689084
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0xA3BC5BCE

0x0F7B6850
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x016C0C27
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0x9667DB34

0x0F7B6850
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xEE6BAEC3

0x0F7B6850
"No mistake at all."
0xD375211D

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x5287853C

0x0F7B6850
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x8322F22A

0x0F7B6850
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x4EA5AD9E
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x0D9DEB55
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0xA1E56ED9

0x0F7B6850
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0xCF40EC63
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xB25A6EE2
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x1E9D06C8
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x42199EFC
Good-night."
0xA7451124

0x0F7B6850
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0xFA978B31
minute!" I cried.
0xC83C0BC7

0x0F7B6850
"Well?"
0x9185C40A

0x0F7B6850
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0xCA7D7A92
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x63E16A21
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xC6AB49DE

0x0F7B6850
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xA069EB00
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0xB8698F79

0x0F7B6850
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x162CB3D5
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0xF0A8D3F7
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0xB02DB92F

0x0F7B6850
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x40E0AFFF
about it."
0xD75E3E50

0x0F7B6850
"Another time."
0xA4ABE033

0x0F7B6850
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x231AB0EE
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x808E6B50

0x0F7B6850
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0xABB4E271

0x0F7B6850
"I would rather not just now."
0x7FEEE64E

0x0F7B6850
"You shall!--you must!"
0x9A2AD885

0x0F7B6850
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0xE7CAF7CC

0x0F7B6850
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0x2A59B5F3
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x43DBD490

0x0F7B6850
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0xE7F1BB3B
persuade."
0xDD8CD3AA

0x0F7B6850
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
0xD468A29B

0x0F7B6850
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
0xAB19E692

0x0F7B6850
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0xD127DD51

0x0F7B6850
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x5561E576
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0x8C68CDCC
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0x54A9B12D
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
0xC203DD26
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0xAFB8AA81

0x0F7B6850
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0x3B45BF31
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0xB0814090
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x750959D7

0x0F7B6850
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0x2BA929CA

0x0F7B6850
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xED47BA83
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0x5A0AD791

0x0F7B6850
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0xA5B27B9B
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x983FC705
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0xCC4A0513

0x0F7B6850
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x3CBAC9A2
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0x5B6808B0
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x7F0B5BFD
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x697C3CA1
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x113371D6
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0x0BEEF141
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x863ED403
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x3760050E
explanation.
0x9F88C5FA

0x0F7B6850
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0xBD8A2A64
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0xFAF0714B
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x8D715066
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x207B8C1B
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x2AF55A98
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x74007DF4
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0xA5BF7F95
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0xC03EA945
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0xDA2E271A
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x1E1072F7
against the door.
0x96DFB4F6

0x0F7B6850
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0x5D37FDFE
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0xF8690832
enough.  I resumed--
0x613E0C55

0x0F7B6850
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x83FEB952

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x28182EE2

0x0F7B6850
He bowed.
0xC2BE2457

0x0F7B6850
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0x07AC62F1
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x269B2895

0x0F7B6850
"Undeniably."
0x9425FB3F

0x0F7B6850
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x47603D36
the same source?"
0x6205001A

0x0F7B6850
"We are cousins; yes."
0x4154D274

0x0F7B6850
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xC7CE143A
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0x1684B2A2
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x58B561BC
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0x939C8DC1
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0xA34C3632
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x3724557F
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0xC8922BDC
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x7C7C4544
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xCD884741
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0xA03AC4D3
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0xD0E3229C
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x8D8F3872
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0x43A7095F

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x68F02E71

0x0F7B6850
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x76B214B4
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x659D1802
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0xC4D1CFFB

0x0F7B6850
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x49B225F1
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0x11B58066
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x793C4D88
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0x326E4C2E

0x0F7B6850
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0xA8F4D1E6
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x57B7C602
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x06A8BEE1
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x947C802F
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0xB0C6D089
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x2272D217
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0xDD7F0A83
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0x80A95D56
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0x6AC0C6F5
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0x4635ADA1
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x600F0B3E
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x6A78164D
enjoyment.
0x027F3A46

0x0F7B6850
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0xF0C047CB
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x7E729E77
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0xA04518F7
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0xFD17C5BE
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0x2C581384

0x0F7B6850
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0x86BBDC78
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0xBD206983
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0xED2053B6

0x0F7B6850
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0xB3B70845
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0xB40B6321

0x0F7B6850
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x38510A86
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x61AAB14E
like an ordinary mortal?"
0xD149D991

0x0F7B6850
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0x56188980
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
0x2D54D279

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0xE17BBC78
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
0xECC1B6A7

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0x42523567
comprehend better."
0x1076CF4F

0x0F7B6850
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
0x1EAF2A4D
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x296EFB63
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0xEB5956EF
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0x0073D70E
fortune that has accrued to them."
0xE2D7A0BB

0x0F7B6850
"To you, you mean."
0xBA59457E

0x0F7B6850
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
0x780FD529
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x1DF293A3
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0x538DD0E2
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x4E6D5E9E
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x4A5F891E
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x56E87CA6
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x425FB6D1
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
0xFD9BDCF2
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
0xFB1F6ACD
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
0xC41CBF3F

0x0F7B6850
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
0xEB844AC7
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
0xBF58A51D

0x0F7B6850
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
0x9488C272
the case?"
0xDC559C8A

0x0F7B6850
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
0xAD77E80D
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0x0DCDD5AA
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x9057A9C3
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0x858B4597
consider it absolutely your own."
0x90F5A20C

0x0F7B6850
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0x8855DFF0
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0x80801E31
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0x6078E2C5
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x8D935A19
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0xBA759A70
myself lifelong friends."
0x2AFFD585

0x0F7B6850
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0x412EE239
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0xCAA6D6AD
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0x43224D8E
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0xF95F5139
you: you cannot--"
0x2EF5276D

0x0F7B6850
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0xCB0CB5DF
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x0023A6E6
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x23D9BB00
and own me, are you?"
0x4099CF15

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0xA32268FA
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0x9A8DABAC

0x0F7B6850
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x939A12CA
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x61FF1B60
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0xB43F3992
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x83DE2E73

0x0F7B6850
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0x4700B83D
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x0FFC8596

0x0F7B6850
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x41621B3B

0x0F7B6850
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0x91F192F0
excitement under which you labour."
0x1B2B11D0

0x0F7B6850
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0x2890E794
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0xE9B3B0A3
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0xF82ABE29
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0xEB5E9E1B
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0x26646240
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0x96C9DDD4
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0xE8DC4C84

0x0F7B6850
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0x3A6906C0
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0xC8578731
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xB375E1BE
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x1751D001
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xBA3604B3
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x20F15821
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0xDD84F5B0

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x6E5B8513
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x0E7A0549
scruple."
0xC63F0ABE

0x0F7B6850
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0xA8FBA5C0

0x0F7B6850
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x78808C63

0x0F7B6850
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x957CE491

0x0F7B6850
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0xC88B8B47
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x95EEDB4F
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x237C980B
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x1984C242
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0xF7915E0B
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0x54257BF5
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x0F818D99
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x88073E41
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0xE14E66CB
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x53652AC1
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
0xC8F4D3BC

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x64536482
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0x1DBDA380
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0xD0E253F2
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x1AB2F81B
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xF22FA607
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0xF7427135
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0x76846CD3
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x04DFD733
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x516F4331
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x7D5C8CED
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xC9E91967

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0x5B6E2672
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x25FA1903
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xADA3D8F6
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x713CA1CB
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0x8DC316EE
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x097E0BD5
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x97E3821A
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0xA625B6AB
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0xF4DF5D0E
girls.
0xBE67CB29

0x0F7B6850
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x918A2BB8
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x2D7EB36B
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x0D2D5A74

0x0F7B6850
"Doubtless."
0x9382F958

0x0F7B6850
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0xECEC5574
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0xA313D548

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x5497EEA3
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x9BBF89C3
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x08D026DB
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x3F10170D

0x0F7B6850
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x6E0B5DE0
What are you going to do?"
0x807C4024

0x0F7B6850
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0xA8014325
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x58BA20AC

0x0F7B6850
"Do you want her?"
0x7932CD80

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0xE5761033
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x3A399C16

0x0F7B6850
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x285F5BB4
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x797275E6

0x0F7B6850
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x03A69F30
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x1563E197

0x0F7B6850
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x90DC147B
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0xF8E1068E
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0x1A162604
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0xDED3D9BD
now?"
0x72FE49F2

0x0F7B6850
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0xEE2D4BAC
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0xA521ACA2
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0xB4D2228E
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0x1E54D0E9
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x107717FE
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0xA8ADFAE5
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xC091C8C9
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x9718AB10
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x5F990644
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x922AEF3D
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0xA5E90B25
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0xCE21182E
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x3D7DEC5B
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0xF6B1C0BF

0x0F7B6850
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0xFDCADE0F

0x0F7B6850
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0xFAA40FAF
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0x07F8FAFE
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x85B6C1F9

0x0F7B6850
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0x6E493548

0x0F7B6850
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0x79153539
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0x0C3EBA30

0x0F7B6850
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0x33982E86

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xC35A3099
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0x84AC83BB
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x1B4A8210
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x6F42BEFB
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0x97D6863F
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0xB73FD712

0x0F7B6850
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x6FB8FA61
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0xD5DB2929
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0xFFD54DB3

0x0F7B6850
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x1379345A
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0x490CE236
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x3720FBE3
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x6B830918
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0x7EE81461
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0x7A2FDF03
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x07C6C168
hear, Jane?"
0x49E827BD

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0x0AF0438B
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0xEFDE03CA

0x0F7B6850
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x8B57BF1C
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x26108233
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0xDBCBE858
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xBF053626
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0x2D673F3C
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x613C24CF
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0xA3BE07BA
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x77354ADA
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x943C432D
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0xAA6A6591
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0xC617FC7E
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0x03A270B1
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0x041F0DDA
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0x69244370
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0xBE16C213
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0xF65CA073
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0x49351A2B
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0x8903B902
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x65078E70
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0xA5812CFC
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x471F0475
without.
0x7D4B8863

0x0F7B6850
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x635ACA2A
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0x0F73D18D
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xE8F56A46

0x0F7B6850
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x3B2A1C40
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x21E0319F
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0x850712F2
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x93227E09
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x79218D02
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0xE9A8CD9C
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x84974373
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0xD0A5EAAD
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0x735152F5
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x7AEDCFCD
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x3967E635
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0xFF04A321
improved aspect of his abode.
0x58903C3A

0x0F7B6850
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0x21BF6BA0
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xA7CDE178
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x13DBA63B

0x0F7B6850
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0xB9887F81
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0x967ECA3F
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0x23657BF1
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0x00BE0338
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xCD5BE7BD

0x0F7B6850
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x65607D21
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0xEF131F11

0x0F7B6850
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x748590FF
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0xDB3AE047
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x39198B1F
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x788FB0E4
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0xAEC18962
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0xDBF9D77C
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x4A16CE4C
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0x34C523AA
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0xB33C1C1E
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0xD66FC130
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xE6CBC50E
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x91A8E553
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x4E75B3F1
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x5381E4CD
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0x3C12F26E
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x2DD0D6C8
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x21978D30
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x0BF6A360

0x0F7B6850
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x054615A6
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0xA91BA0FF
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x66FC7767
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0xC026AF11
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0x1F82C686
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0xD63C3C23
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x23372399
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x7DEBD735
career--I see it now."
0x07539C40

0x0F7B6850
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x57A9CB67
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x345A5A4A
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x9E5DE3B5
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x2AAAD424
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x9F72BFA0
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xDCAE2D46
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x6E546C60
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x80951B87
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0xBF603EC6
into the house.
0x62E3BDBA

0x0F7B6850
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x01FF4690
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x9DAA4BE3
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0xE3F33EA6
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x18395AE0
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0xDD7D08FE
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xF10F3412
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xB29309C8
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x747D6A30

0x0F7B6850
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0x6C371218
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0xB6CEE34A
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0x8FE32A09
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x0F97EB45
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0xF3024A77
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x250CCA17
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0xE850BFEF

0x0F7B6850
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0xACC0BF11
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x2BCD4ED4
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x591E14AF
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x498C3A48
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x8D999699
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x730C77AD
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x4B0A4118
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0xB2A2C4AD
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x0FADF8B5
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0xD434C4B1
mother, who was drawing away."
0x1242F479

0x0F7B6850
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0xB44AE739

0x0F7B6850
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x2CC951BE
the way."
0xF16813FE

0x0F7B6850
"Tell him I will go."
0x0B96B489

0x0F7B6850
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x1CF003BF
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0x2FE34FCA
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x88AAB169
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x844118F2

0x0F7B6850
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0xAD31BCDF
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x9D27D663
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x2A49125D
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xF5DB49E5
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x9D77FE45
with himself.
0xB9B942D5

0x0F7B6850
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0x162031F2
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x5B06EBC4
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x992ACEBD
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x9EA62F5C
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x54468D65
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0xB7D0F9C8
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x1CAA2EDA
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x09CCDCBC
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xB88CAAC9
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0x7841BF88
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0x9E738E2B

0x0F7B6850
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0xCDE184AE
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x1E9A8E76

0x0F7B6850
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0xE6709DB2
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0xF3FD5BE9
ensuing year.
0x36CADB4C

0x0F7B6850
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x9C5E4685
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x577FA8E0
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0xE717F3A9
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x8015AEEE

0x0F7B6850
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x84A3DCA0
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x4F48E8AE
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0xC9940FC9
yesterday."
0xD1630DA4

0x0F7B6850
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x48ED515B
he was serene as glass.
0xA6BD51C5

0x0F7B6850
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x38BC35A4
known each other long."
0x5AF87AB9

0x0F7B6850
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0xCB285E01
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0xA1AD22C1
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x1F2A39E1
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x4EB48F29
can he refitted for their reception."
0x39185794

0x0F7B6850
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x9BE97D9D
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x0963DB9A
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x3E86C843
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0xBD80AF38
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x1A13EC81
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0xF3D4A4A4
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x5C0FFF48
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x3827622F
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x8C17673A
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0xD3F8E17D
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x2D7593C6
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0xD384BD4F
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x79D67C42
frigidity.
0xDD70629F

0x0F7B6850
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x450DB400
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x3EFB3286

0x0F7B6850
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0xEDF5BBD0

0x0F7B6850
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x11417E1A
moment's hesitation I answered--
0x35C78541

0x0F7B6850
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0xE3D5D32B
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x13A3BCD4

0x0F7B6850
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x857A783B
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x5C0B00D7
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x34943AE8
returned to his papers and his silence.
0xBE30F4B3

0x0F7B6850
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xE9AAB059
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0xDCFE958D
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x80AB5BBA
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x8AC140F0
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x5F1C11F5
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x763E3344
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0xC89607A9
plans.
0x7BB068B3

0x0F7B6850
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x8255EB38
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xBE1D48EA
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x9A9F3B12
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x3F6DF142
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0xEF03B8EC
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0x3989C6B2
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x22B60F67
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xEFF6D420
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x7DC61062
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0xB8CC3818
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x7EC57CD6
the task without regard to the elements.
0x2F7C0080

0x0F7B6850
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0x6BF10682
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x2EADF27A
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x4C840118
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x808DDE92

0x0F7B6850
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x75296EAC
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0x4354672F
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x33175567
was a special annoyance.
0xBDCFCB43

0x0F7B6850
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0x7B5C3C8F
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x5EE6C551
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0xD1247B9B
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x03D4DB1A
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x9F3CBAC5
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x3EC4826B
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x0742FDA3
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0xF68C8CE6

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0xC47C1A92

0x0F7B6850
"Learning German."
0x019E3EE6

0x0F7B6850
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x4D1E8866

0x0F7B6850
"You are not in earnest?"
0xC0705570

0x0F7B6850
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x9C50CF4C

0x0F7B6850
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0xFF741ADA
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0xF064D2CD
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x994948C6
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x87160BE1
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x315A254A
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xAABA5CDB
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xC757637E
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x1535B8CB
barely three months to his departure.
0xE0577C9C

0x0F7B6850
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x6EA170F3
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0xB21F4884
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0xFBCC4DFA
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x7D039973
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x454FF237
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0x2D95B9F7

0x0F7B6850
"I know it."
0x0297F8FB

0x0F7B6850
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0xF2AE1B3E
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x5044C964
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x2383B095
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x32CAB485
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x09C33265
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0xCAC9E2FF
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x28FC9A04
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x72664C9D
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x76CCB1BB
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x0AFA1E62
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0xFEE479C0
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x1924A8A6

0x0F7B6850
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xFB19A2BB
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0xE7B9E712
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x6FFD9F51
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x479070D9
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x94913F8A

0x0F7B6850
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0xCD81EC01
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x81B28437

0x0F7B6850
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0xA4F909B5
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x7B7AF062
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x0EA1E329
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0xDACCF22D
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x20C759ED
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x68EBBB53
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0xFCA08107
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0xD0CDAD6D
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x94BCF6D8
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x2CCADD90
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x3A80247B
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0xFD3BBF24

0x0F7B6850
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x2BD68B5B
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x757D95A1
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0x402EFB30
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0xBA1E5CF7
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x5EE64DDB
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0xA2F649B1
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x200DFFC3
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0xF60CE5DC
own.
0x359A7C81

0x0F7B6850
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0xFF2DD4DF
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0xB8E60989
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x64A9531D

0x0F7B6850
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x4EB3AA0F
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0x6DD67CEC
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0xBFB0CAF1
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x4AFEAA26
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0xCA0CDB55
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x145A73B6
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x6205564E
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0xA1532897

0x0F7B6850
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0xCE0440D6
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x42BE7618
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0x77F67376
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0xF1B62E6E
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x7F1E74A0
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0xAD7078E9
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x4F54ACB1
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0x5CD7445B
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0xB1AEA7E7

0x0F7B6850
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0xB9538E65
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0x726AE194
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x99879227
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x79A8E135
then I felt dark indeed.
0x5ACE4D7A

0x0F7B6850
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x8BCDAF9E
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x84978E3D
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0x51CA7CAC
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x3FFD9613
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x77C83BB1
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0xF5D01C55
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x11B10E3C
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0xBC8526A3

0x0F7B6850
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x971CD984
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x1EF9EEAA
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0x1B6D37B8
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x8FFA9BBE
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x856196CE
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x04530D90
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x7F976C03
eyes filled again.
0xA5A6DBF6

0x0F7B6850
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0x44F44BB2
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0x9CB89131
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x7E5AFAF8
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x4EDC246D
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0x5F970C9E
as to its cause; he only said--
0xF1FA4EA0

0x0F7B6850
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x72966F4E
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x0509E41C
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0xD28849DD
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x73AF29AE
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0x67914450
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xE40190DF
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xA4F882A7
said--
0xD489085A

0x0F7B6850
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xE23DA99D

0x0F7B6850
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x17421E70

0x0F7B6850
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0xA590F2BE
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xE844B295
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x653562E4

0x0F7B6850
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0xA2D5F11A
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xA9FE2723
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x32C7C701
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0x9809DE18
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0x4B79E747
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xA90100B4
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0x7ECED11A
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0xD8A52CED

0x0F7B6850
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x135F8564
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0xFBE74DB2
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xF188CF35
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xFC769DDB
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0xC5BAAF93
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x67C48D75
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x9E5AC17A
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0xC839B213

0x0F7B6850
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0xAA6C28E8
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x042BBDFB
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x7D6D40F0
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0xF63D7A70
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x8E33AC1E
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x24635BBD
last refuge for silence.
0x2CBB9F07

0x0F7B6850
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x98F23DC6
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x81B42084
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0xD9295AFD
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x214115BB
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0xF3535E76

0x0F7B6850
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0xBD0FC011
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x613455E6
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0xA2A05B81

0x0F7B6850
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xF384E32B
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0xCCAE6A18
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0xB82B63D6

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x0523DD82
sails on the 20th of June."
0xF3368D25

0x0F7B6850
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x1BF05589

0x0F7B6850
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x998ACB96
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0xAD2E0224
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x7AC7D89C
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0x5822FC98
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x23714F66
same enterprise."
0x6FABDAD8

0x0F7B6850
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0x0EB5A3BF
to march with the strong."
0x613B9A00

0x0F7B6850
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0xB4386E7E
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0x7FB13D8C

0x0F7B6850
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0xEAACD018

0x0F7B6850
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0x8A96E88E
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x6448A57F
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0xE61B0721
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0xC7673BE3

0x0F7B6850
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0xDC7A56A1
the first to inform them of it?"
0x2997DC06

0x0F7B6850
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0xD5BF6B33
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0x129DDE5A
rivet the spell.
0x159FE12F

0x0F7B6850
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0x09F80D9A

0x0F7B6850
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0xD76E7F9D

0x0F7B6850
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0x3E754444
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0x6DD3AA0C

0x0F7B6850
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0x3BC12820
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x11B17302
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x2C66F959
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x32A70557

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0x49C749E8

0x0F7B6850
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0xA74FFC76
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0xAE758F9C

0x0F7B6850
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0xBEED5394
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0xC47734B5
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0xB0DFB380
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's

service."
0x0F0E9830

0x0F7B6850
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0xD1D29987

0x0F7B6850
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0xEDD6E926
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0x289FFEDB
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x5393F8C1
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x1D41DBFA
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x004D4F24
for him.
0x28F47E21

0x0F7B6850
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x5A7B72C2
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0xF048C464
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x5947270D
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x4D4E6B74
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0xE3087818
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x8B520D8A
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0xBB2094DE
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x4CFBFCD3
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0x1DEE7E42
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0x3C7D0671
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0x78BDEC13

0x0F7B6850
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0x1898D192
labours."
0x064A7871

0x0F7B6850
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
0x5DCF01BC
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x30CCE1D0
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0x691C421E
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
0xBA569120

0x0F7B6850
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0x81627AC8
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0xB2754BEA
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0x771FC233
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0x7C0D7D96
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0x9E9F9934
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0x6723320F

0x0F7B6850
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0x09A16F1B
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0xAA620142
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0xED2DE922
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x8FABA2FD
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0xFB19197D
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x9933695C
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0x1ACE14E6
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0xB5198544
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x216BDCF4
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x4B43B3AB
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0x3BF54756
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x7887DD4B
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0x278E58BB
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xC0AC60D6
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x12A7987D
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xA08C35E4
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xF847BDBA
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0xBD610B05
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x875919E3
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0x070B7549
be to me invaluable."
0x280CF3C6

0x0F7B6850
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x2DEC47DC
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0xE777CBC1
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x9378E672
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0xADE7B2B3
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0x2B6B6475
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x5B88C835
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
0x569DEE27

0x0F7B6850
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0xE93B96D4
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
0x3DEDE966

0x0F7B6850
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:

0x4E4851A5

0x0F7B6850
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x297D7B27
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x7B405CC3
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x1CDA18E6
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x0F9DB00A
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x69F6395A
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x6CE8AB63
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0x36D9CCCE
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x6ED268E1
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x172CCC9C
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x98DF4E8B
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0x140A716C
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0xE4F8FE5A
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x83A2AAB8
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x987F400C
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0x45A2523E
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x0CF519B7
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x371B7971
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x210B6CCB
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x37DB31F2
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0xB793B444
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x8F9932C6
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x4902CBB8
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xAF038446
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x309A9C00
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x17D03B57
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0x51E1E34B

0x0F7B6850
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0xBA6478EB
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x6CAC7114
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x2AED9704
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x9FCA8B86
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x1878F5C1
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0xEB49AABE
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xCFB31A5E
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0x8547B62B
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xAF9F000B
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x47D38AC2
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x00E77FB3
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xFCC46880
I will tell him so."
0xC26C5AC0

0x0F7B6850
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x6D98EB78
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x5F5A9B87
his feet and approached me.
0x789ECCFF

0x0F7B6850
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0x7AAF556F

0x0F7B6850
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0xE1B23E99

0x0F7B6850
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0x0C28B592
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x407F9C3F

0x0F7B6850
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0xF3B31DDD
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x0BB9B810
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x635978F9
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0xE02E7676
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x58C9DFC5
sense will guide you."
0xE3A75EC3

0x0F7B6850
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0xACB83233
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x7AA2515A
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xB32DD4FB
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0xF4824CA3
continue."
0x470A350D

0x0F7B6850
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0x07BF402B
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0x20AC1505
have said that."
0x30A640E4

0x0F7B6850
"Conditionally."
0x44CD0C27

0x0F7B6850
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0x7417D3FD
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0xE52CC3F1
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0xF88D6AAA
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0xE843E1B2
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0x5D053620
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0xACA4F8FD
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x09178F07
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x72DAE1F6
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x803BCB8F
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0xF5396D91
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0xBE68E3F3

0x0F7B6850
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0x4C585391
my limbs.
0x679DB861

0x0F7B6850
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0xBF183C36

0x0F7B6850
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0xEBB869C6
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0x3EDF6DC6
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0x82AC0565

0x0F7B6850
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0x695757CB
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0xDDBE3BB4
them he has no use: I retain them."
0x4A52CA5F

0x0F7B6850
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0xDD2FB2B2
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x1BC9015E
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0xCE32F011
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0x99BA84D2

0x0F7B6850
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0xBFA376AA

0x0F7B6850
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0xFC4849D4
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0xF07529B9
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x8F8775C9
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0xF8428FEE
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0xDF8E41BB
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0xFE4D2126
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0xE51B1B11
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0xBF6160B8
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x3C894543
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x2F94FDB7
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0x23D82F53
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x5E1CAF66
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xB09E7C73

0x0F7B6850
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x22D0CD3C
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x6326F38A

0x0F7B6850
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x404CD4D0
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x03287E2E
this signify?"
0x4895F0E4

0x0F7B6850
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xF251ADBB
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x96C74770
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x6E7E9E58
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0xB3D2F702
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x6EC98759
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x7BEC062C
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x6FF7827B
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x7786ADA7
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0x619C1BD6
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x7F654BD1
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x09D074B2
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xB6D70512
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0x1D9DE8E5

0x0F7B6850
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0xFCC23529
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x0E929465
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xF3412A73
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x1CFC6F99
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0xBA5C795E
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x05D92CFF
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x075EEF33
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0xC5F175B9
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x9C6991A1
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x4052B9B5
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0xF2773019
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0x16E79921
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x0D490FB0
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x8A371010
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x6A39B2D3
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x7E275E5A
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0xF84F7537
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x8ED27243
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0xEC016244
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x71432242
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x4912E71E
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x747C9BEF

0x0F7B6850
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x7C9A21B8

0x0F7B6850
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x9A59E932

0x0F7B6850
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0xE55B9824
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0xD4E37242

0x0F7B6850
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xF2CB458A
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x0D5481C3
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x7C267194
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0xE5168453
tribes--and unwed?"
0x2E06D71A

0x0F7B6850
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xBFED2595
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0xBF0445EB
yourself."
0xCDA7B270

0x0F7B6850
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x15E7D2E8
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x1921F1EA
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0xE0B30F7C
heart and--it would not do."
0x351AF69E

0x0F7B6850
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0xCC8A09EB
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0xA4196687
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x7CE543DF
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0xC43C03E6
nothing more--don't fear."
0x91DB7FB8

0x0F7B6850
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x1B6473CF
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x6DC16DB2
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x9C293516
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0xECF13A83
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xEBF1FFFA
eyes."
0x38D39298

0x0F7B6850
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x5002B6C7
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0xBDDB1979
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0xB384FA42
offer it."
0x9011F1F4

0x0F7B6850
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x3971AED8
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x9D5FDBD5
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0x850A6DF6

0x0F7B6850
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0xEE94C8FA
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x24DF29F6

0x0F7B6850
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0xAF58CBAE

0x0F7B6850
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0x7B3F97A9
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x4183B92D
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xB1907A64
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0xBC260D52
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x577E4DF7
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x0C0BE830

0x0F7B6850
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0x28C6356B
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x1A143E2B
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x6D2BFCEF
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xDD09EE09
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x429A45B0
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x1D019FE3
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0xE7C1A1DD
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0x3E141A2A
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0x196A5C4F
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xD415724A

0x0F7B6850
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0xD8F41DE0

0x0F7B6850
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x67FD3814

0x0F7B6850
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x6AE257A6
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xAD431A97
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0xA0AB90DA
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x94C67FF0
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0x3EF60D1B
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0x8CF9151E
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x865F7192
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0xE3B43218
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xF08F0FF0

0x0F7B6850
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0x961B6340
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x9C56365F
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x04782D7F
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xF4E8A15F

0x0F7B6850
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x3B5D7CFD
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x750128C6
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0x3CDAD576

0x0F7B6850
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0x763CFA0C
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0x443798FA
stairs.
0xD005F8D3

0x0F7B6850
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0xA8866110

0x0F7B6850
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x0C810022

0x0F7B6850
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x9236629E

0x0F7B6850
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0xD7E826D8
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0xCF6AD988
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x3DA8BBE5
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0xF99B713F
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xFEEBCFD6
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0x0D19C2AB
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x264ED0FF

0x0F7B6850
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0xEFE52280
down.
0x0BF4F652

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXXV
0x86D369DA

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0x6C37286B
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0xB7870833
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x9A6E3CE1
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0xB55D5131
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x858002B6
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0xE879AAF2

0x0F7B6850
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0x467DCD67
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0x8A9223DF
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x18B0B44C
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x4E41E5FA
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x48809779
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0xCA721AAC
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x042056FF
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0xCDD5EA65
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x3D89FCD1

0x0F7B6850
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x856B99D2
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x3300C1D6
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0xAAB10CFA
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0xD4350FED
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0x19438F67
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0xF4EF41FF
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x96725CAF
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0xED9A212B
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x530225D2

0x0F7B6850
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x8E074BDB
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xAE8785C6
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x8E7A4854
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x34690265
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0xA508BC79
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0xD87C3BC3
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0xD73213E9
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0x959629B3
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0xA26A8228
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x21AD2BEF
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0xEA8C8325
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x038C40A2
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0xAC02B94B
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0xE8A33EFC
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0xBE1193D3

0x0F7B6850
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x8C231069
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x20DB68B6
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x9B787C87
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0x65237911
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x22F5A5A5
spoke to the point at once.
0x77B9B173

0x0F7B6850
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0xC058ED20
friends."
0x708FCD99

0x0F7B6850
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0xF3638346
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x51642BC7

0x0F7B6850
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0xB302A623

0x0F7B6850
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0xFB1F87C9
good."
0xB76B9A58

0x0F7B6850
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0xCEBF67C5
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x127244CB
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x7079C9D9
strangers."
0x5D208703

0x0F7B6850
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x6EFFDD39
regarding you as a stranger."
0x1E824EAB

0x0F7B6850
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x4BE9D54B
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x1A18512A
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x2ED633D1
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x6893D76F
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x8771FC1A
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x4567B00C

0x0F7B6850
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0xB0460C8E
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0x039ED4E6

0x0F7B6850
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0x07AFB2C2

0x0F7B6850
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0xCEFA3B69
India?"
0x4527DDA5

0x0F7B6850
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0x35C07C41

0x0F7B6850
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x2A77EC14

0x0F7B6850
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0xCBE8C818
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x64D5E86A
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x2B16A8C5

0x0F7B6850
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x73C80FF0

0x0F7B6850
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0xDCF1DD75
crash down.
0x84086D76

0x0F7B6850
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x9EEDBF7B

0x0F7B6850
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x2CE7D078
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0x08326387
You are killing me now."
0x3F8EC29C

0x0F7B6850
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x844BA333

0x0F7B6850
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0xA816CC8B
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0xECA12DDA
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0x7909A0B1
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x32980E3B
until seventy-and-seven times."
0x40A52282

0x0F7B6850
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x66AFA226
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0xF390C551
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0x56D75940

0x0F7B6850
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xA28311D4
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x75A0553F

0x0F7B6850
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0x4A9FD26A
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xA29A1947
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x0B6B7C14

0x0F7B6850
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0xC543E661
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0xAAC91B5B

0x0F7B6850
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x0622499A
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x35D1837D
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xB979CAB0

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0xE75CED60

0x0F7B6850
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x148825A0
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x3125827F
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x2CE5E6E8
spoke at last.
0xAF5F9055

0x0F7B6850
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xB6FEE174
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0xD74F3D39
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x8CB63108
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x84AF6BE1
sake."
0x335DBB43

0x0F7B6850
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x13A4E195
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x4949322C
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0xA038A9A8
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0xBD71E292
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x77C8F299
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0xAC1E5BDF

0x0F7B6850
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x7E4627FD
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0xBBAE50AB

0x0F7B6850
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x89D71761
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0xB5DA12BC
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x6EDDE70D
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0x0F436F22
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0x430CE083
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0x93ACC1FE

0x0F7B6850
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xB00BB127
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0xB6F5E30B
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0x7C637609

0x0F7B6850
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0xE35D0EFC
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0xF4B00FEF
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x775FDA77
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x09D906F2
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xDD82CC45

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x745CB1F1

0x0F7B6850
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x8D14AE3D
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0xF0B93E2F
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0xD9A0EF52
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0xA192FEE8
leaving it."
0x570482DD

0x0F7B6850
"What do you mean?"
0x22948ACD

0x0F7B6850
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x2EE4DF3D
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x7BE01C8D
some means that doubt is removed."
0xD98BA4E6

0x0F7B6850
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x6ECCD214
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0xDC5C49F7
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0xADA98863
Rochester?"
0x837F7581

0x0F7B6850
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0x3A048417

0x0F7B6850
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x8AAC2966

0x0F7B6850
"I must find out what is become of him."
0xA1427495

0x0F7B6850
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x96279F70
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0x9DD74DA9
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x202AE3E4
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0xDEE14BA0

0x0F7B6850
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xC35F3FCF
was soon out of sight.
0xA26DA0D5

0x0F7B6850
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0x5AE258B5
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x66E1988E
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0xEFF06F60

0x0F7B6850
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0xEF317C13
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x5876CC9C
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x2E884AD6
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x5D10EB28
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x16B4C9B5

0x0F7B6850
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xAB4B5DD3

0x0F7B6850
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x8AA81A38
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0xE1196EB2
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0x7CC3033E
Jane?"
0x7C390F10

0x0F7B6850
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0xF1C9B15D

0x0F7B6850
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0xFCDECDD4
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0xB485BA84
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0xA354A53B

0x0F7B6850
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x6F6DA025

0x0F7B6850
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0x5C48BD9D
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x765829EF

0x0F7B6850
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0x8FCD2C1D
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x1DE5B072

0x0F7B6850
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0xEE824830

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x1330FAB4
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x5938459D

0x0F7B6850
"I have refused to marry him--"
0xF36FA8B9

0x0F7B6850
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x9D0B451A

0x0F7B6850
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x573B5512
as his sister."
0xE27CDBDB

0x0F7B6850
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0xB7B0D232
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x45E93381
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xCABE5B77
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xD0CC7C10
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x5DDE13C6
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x204A1B9C
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x56478823

0x0F7B6850
"Not as a husband."
0x2EEE3143

0x0F7B6850
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0xD7B2CF83

0x0F7B6850
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x7CBB443C

0x0F7B6850
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x7EFB74EF
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0xCEA215E5
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0xF87159AF

0x0F7B6850
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0xDD2115F5
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0xB7BCD1E9
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x781A901A
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0xF3E84A23
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xC12848F3

0x0F7B6850
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0x555BD906

0x0F7B6850
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x9EC85807
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0xE121B712
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0x94F471B5
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x04F92B85
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x4FACFAF5
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0xBFB62711

0x0F7B6850
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0x2E780E79

0x0F7B6850
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x6CFACC01
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x89454EB4
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0xC31726F2
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x2A9A3536
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x23087321
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x548DF731
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0x4D45C9C4
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x57CCE629

0x0F7B6850
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x96295096

0x0F7B6850
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x617889B7
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0x43B29D76
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x35B638E2
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0x69FB0C39
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x1BAE852D

0x0F7B6850
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x567607D0
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x91239905
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x74701F12
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0xE9617C8C
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0xDF770746
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0x8EA3806B
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x2780BC42
had forgiven me once more.
0x8C36D460

0x0F7B6850
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x001B64FE
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0xDEC3046B
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x3F28D751
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0xBB3D532A
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0xFFA7338D
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x94B8B805
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x2B16B4AE
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0xA4BF4F1F
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x76F4006F
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0x38C8221C
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x64D3BD0E
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x1846E7C6
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0x82939501
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x180528D0

0x0F7B6850
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x8170BE2A
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0xB2A36E50
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x080CC6E4

0x0F7B6850
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x29B0AD8D
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x00776244
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x5952C1FC
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x134AC941

0x0F7B6850
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0x21CAFD67

0x0F7B6850
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0x718271F7
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0x6E4FBBFA
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x219F9C3F
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xA9AB0B82
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0xB72470C8
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0xBADB9E7A
Lamb is the light thereof.
0x49D66905

0x0F7B6850
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0x0D172616
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0xBD13E6FD
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x090127C3
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x56BF47CA
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x816E0871
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x4B7A988E
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x82A00CD9
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0x74C13126
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x89893390
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x5510BD4E
could not but feel it too.
0xE2F241F2

0x0F7B6850
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x7B347390
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0xE27A5DA2
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0xCBCD6261
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0xEF008DD3

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x23A87A82
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x937D8F66
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x20661A9D
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x52352389
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0xD64D09BA
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x1A1E0F4F
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0xB782CD9B
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x0F3F3082
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0xDA6E8D78
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xF5785AA1
from you!"
0x1F1D7A66

0x0F7B6850
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0x49D44EB7
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0xA7259060
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0xB2539300
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0xFA2B3DC3
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x31AAAFBF
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0xF2B0F585
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xB17B92A2
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x317CBA96
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x2A462A46
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x2E5BC213
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0x0D556726
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0xF57CF9E1
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0xF7AD4584
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0xEC99165B
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x6A9B2AFC
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x48F990AF

0x0F7B6850
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0xEF5C0491
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0xA35F69FF
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0xD6D76167
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x031004C6
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x3643B042
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xC198C3BC
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x19A277D9
dim room was full of visions.
0xD1E2550B

0x0F7B6850
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x6FE1325D
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0xF6ADF09F
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x088EEFD2
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0x85AE212A
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x118DC4E1
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0x47D69EC6
prayer: it was only elevated.
0x6211C91F

0x0F7B6850
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0x9F6C61B3
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0xD87EC7BB
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0x55ED3FCE

0x0F7B6850
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0x6CF7C085
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0xBF1DA837
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0xBA112E73
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0xD9EE8B9E
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x55E11222
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0xEDB0374C
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x89E34950
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x3BB80788
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x2B2EA8BB
shall judge.
0xE47C11FD

0x0F7B6850
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0xB18836CE
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0xA3ED729C
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0x796D653F
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x43D4AC01
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0xEEC8FB78
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0xC83C16DF
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x19BE0618
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x89CCBC2A
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x50930197
bones.
0x431A5CAE

0x0F7B6850
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x55150B3A
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0xC635E8A2

0x0F7B6850
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x07ABB355

0x0F7B6850
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0x8A250378

0x0F7B6850
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x24413872
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x655EF6A3
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x30931877
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0xFD8AE7BD
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x6691859B
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0xCC4D265D

0x0F7B6850
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x069B382C
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x21094F5E
garden: it was void.
0x223A8594

0x0F7B6850
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x96E10710

0x0F7B6850
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x659FAC0D
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0xC73C3406
loneliness and midnight hush.
0xC1716B1F

0x0F7B6850
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0xA5213CC5
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xCAA44B43
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0x587275FC
best."
0x97803376

0x0F7B6850
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0x959E786B
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0xCD7DDC5C
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x040E45CD
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x777E08AB
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x4DB4DCCB
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0xDD96C82A
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0x5FC72CA7
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0xC5994D9D
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0xECE91F0D
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
0xBB6E75CD

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXXVI
0xA3FAD9ED

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0xB041CBEE
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x3CCDF537
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0xA9E487C1
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x32821B09
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0xCB6A60E2
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0xE9FD3049

0x0F7B6850
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x9FEF34D4
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xD0377792
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x4F47F640
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0xF28AF41C
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x791D5197
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x1FE3CA74

0x0F7B6850
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0xA0AE25E5
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x8BC0EE85
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0x6FE24859
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0xB2AE9738
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0x4B472B49

0x0F7B6850
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xE195526B
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x4C94E142
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x1D3779A2
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x63A046F1
would meet the coach.
0xE752EFD2

0x0F7B6850
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x42E0CA0F
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xE0D5677E
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0x9DD63F2B

0x0F7B6850
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x0BD70DFA
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x26CE4D2E
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0xFC5B9089
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x3FAB6691
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x5EB46797
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x00B22EB4
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0xD7889ED7
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x39B7D9BB
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0x8974C4DA
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x13ABB80F
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x9EC3CEAB
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x4C9BE86B
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0xDC63B074
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0x97D302E7
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x657701D4
body.
0xA69D0955

0x0F7B6850
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x8C095707
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0xE4050342
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x936D7EF8

0x0F7B6850
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0xA6138872
and should be absent at least four days.
0xBF17AE87

0x0F7B6850
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x1B58AB24

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x20354438
time been uneasy."
0x21568278

0x0F7B6850
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x8E70D036
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x8F91B183
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x6C80F977
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xBC5B112B
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0xAA22987A
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x451988C1

0x0F7B6850
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x4F0B4B0F
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x0C45D8CA
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x18EF80DA
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0xA4EF1F1A
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x2CAC1702

0x0F7B6850
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0xA8722861
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x122507A4
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0xDCC227D7
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0xED6DB61E
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0xE23135B3
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x22DF54A9
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0xF1632DAB
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x8C9D2BD6
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x82023790

0x0F7B6850
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0x722D8EC2
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x3CA865FB
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0xF32813E9
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x91E0512B
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0x1F40FF4E
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0xB60F0C68
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x5090B985
we were near my bourne.
0xB2DD939E

0x0F7B6850
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0x84F122E5

0x0F7B6850
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x01E45E77

0x0F7B6850
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0xDDBDC534
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x3B073FE3
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0xB6743DB3
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0xDF74FE39
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0xD64DE40A
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0x8F83CF07

0x0F7B6850
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x9A596835
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0xF236FA41
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x1936B3AA
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x9C0B7635
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x0069C3DC
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0x1EF8F871
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0xCB63F309
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0xD6B7BEF3

0x0F7B6850
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x63795F1E
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0x390B4170
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x0CA18EA7
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xE2C185B6
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x6BA13074
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0xB3BD3282
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x0ED0C386
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x420FC3C1
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x6EF79905
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x86B1A780
them!
0x0DB78B33

0x0F7B6850
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x2D5CD3C7
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x9858BAFC
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0xAB06E5C9
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x4D8DB997
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xA1F8D6A5
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x35217EAC
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0xD48A1F80
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0xA5652F68
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0xE925E3ED
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x57B80768
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x91937D55
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0xAF157435
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0xE96BC31C
tideless sea of the south."
0x39C3EE7F

0x0F7B6850
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x9320D121
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0xE083010F
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x7175A03A
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0xDD9B64FB
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x710B5142
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x40FB8512
station were at my command.
0x802B2B8C

0x0F7B6850
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xD56CC10F
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x4C9DBC03
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x307CDED2
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x8D08E31E
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0xDE43FB7F
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xAA80A247
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x77B290FA
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0xA5ABD7BB

0x0F7B6850
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x2B45E803

0x0F7B6850
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x432A3F22
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0xED4671F7
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0xFA355DB1
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xDF254B72
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0x82C2B064
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x5D7B4333
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0xBA573141
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x02B08E94
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x1F0B2711
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0x235AC54D
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x64B32FBF
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x300F465E
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0xD57DA72D

0x0F7B6850
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0x29979510
ruin.
0x0C4F1D28

0x0F7B6850
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x4FAA1FDF
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x6C821928
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x277A99FF
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x7482CAD0
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x3F7435BE
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x2BD6438B
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x8761C190

0x0F7B6850
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x2682267E
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x9A092047
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0x2EF92201
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x1997049D
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xD686DF09
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x4F88DD3A
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0x78BD8B2D
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x195AA491
token.
0x4AC0F5AC

0x0F7B6850
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x0CBD45FD
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x897EF54D
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x2AD736E7
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0xBE5C707C
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x6B9C125C
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x88DEF763
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x5001B8D2
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x1A3902B3
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x66C7062E
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x63A3CB0B

0x0F7B6850
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x30E7E1F4
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x150EBDB3
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0x381EC6BE
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0x71AD036F
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x077BCF30
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x59E54180
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x4A43F05A

0x0F7B6850
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x6DFC9E2C

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0x15A46C22

0x0F7B6850
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0x3C81E5BA

0x0F7B6850
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0xFDE9A6CA

0x0F7B6850
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0xB6D21745
trying to evade.
0x7AE3FDD7

0x0F7B6850
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0x88A27E44

0x0F7B6850
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xFF11A921
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0xD9FEF494
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0xADADF12B
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0xF7521F90
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x0B6B2993
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xF7EE55AE
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0x6ED088E8
Antipodes.
0x5A8E17BE

0x0F7B6850
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x5E43EB84
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x5E003DF0
direct question as to where he really was.
0x3746E7E5

0x0F7B6850
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x1F2AED3F
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x93A82412
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0xE620FC5D
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0x9E5C9E94
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xF7D3CBB4
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0x63FD97C6
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x6A79D09E
witnessed it myself."
0x8F9A7459

0x0F7B6850
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x301757D8
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0xCF706F85

0x0F7B6850
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x5857E89C
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x42E03264
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x79D89B43
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0xE55E2CFA

0x0F7B6850
"I have heard something of it."
0xA57CBD30

0x0F7B6850
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0xBB480232
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0xAF8D28B4
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0xF34D1A41
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x2CF3A141
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0x4C5B56FD
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0xA9E43810

0x0F7B6850
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x4BBC6701
main fact.
0x401C2341

0x0F7B6850
"And this lady?"
0x7650CD5D

0x0F7B6850
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0xBA8DBDC1
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xDE0B1489
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x6AE4337A

0x0F7B6850
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x0A4B9132

0x0F7B6850
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0xA799C2C3
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x9AE433EA
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0xFF41229D
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xF7D31EF3
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0xF5FC12D3
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x7E44EC7F
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x1CA116E1
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x372FF727
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0x45CA50A1
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x261066B7

0x0F7B6850
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0x799204FC
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x960BAC75
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0x51410B1F

0x0F7B6850
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x93AA5FAF
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0xD4BF6534
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0x769B61B6
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x01ED444A
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x501EBDCD
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x6BA8EADF
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0x7E1B9603
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x26D28DC4
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x2D365615
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x36B86485
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xAB006DA9
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xAD3ADCC2
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x81D1D965
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0x3F7971CB
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x98D9B03C
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x0D680C69
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x6018AA02
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0x36DFA03B
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x6F9FF553
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x721FB913
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x1D8CAAFE
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0xC4C22B48
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0xEE2432AC
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0xC404E0CF
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0x322BCF3C
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0xC5E7D214

0x0F7B6850
"What! did he not leave England?"
0x5E37B1EC

0x0F7B6850
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x172EE4D4
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xBB9F1A81
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x4A2C8225
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0xF43675E8
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x37EB66BF
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0xFB92C8A4
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0xCB8B39F0
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x5EFC7F1B
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xB7A86B93
Thornfield Hall."
0x5304B861

0x0F7B6850
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xFCDACE68

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x52207FEA
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x78FC9EE4
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xA5F42054
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x055F98AF
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0xF671FCB1
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0x4B773886
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x0CAB74E0
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0xB4D4FCA2
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0xA9E35259
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x2ED88F0E
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x883CDE00
pavement."
0x68DA2C62

0x0F7B6850
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
0x0FFB7C1B

0x0F7B6850
"Dead?"
0x6DDE0D21

0x0F7B6850
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
0x9C5F9837
scattered."
0xED307DF8

0x0F7B6850
"Good God!"
0x822EC720

0x0F7B6850
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
0xB8899CAA

0x0F7B6850
He shuddered.
0x9D822318

0x0F7B6850
"And afterwards?" I urged.
0x2011AC42

0x0F7B6850
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
0x8590F077
only some bits of walls standing now."
0x2635206D

0x0F7B6850
"Were any other lives lost?"
0x1FE9D374

0x0F7B6850
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
0x6BE3797D

0x0F7B6850
"What do you mean?"
0x22948ACD

0x0F7B6850
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
0x42506ACD
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
0xD5DF7585
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
0x4957CECB
pity him, for my part."
0x988DED85

0x0F7B6850
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
0x10278FD0

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
0x59CFD1ED

0x0F7B6850
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
0xAB9ABF18
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
0x1335DB83

0x0F7B6850
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
0xDE1993C7
fixture now."
0x3709C4B5

0x0F7B6850
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
0x0C608576

0x0F7B6850
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
0xCF4339BB
Edward."
0x401AC7FC

0x0F7B6850
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0xB160EE7B
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x98FF07C1

0x0F7B6850
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x09B2A196
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x611E47C1
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0xC76957AA
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x88ED7E4E
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0x725066CA
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x22FC90C1
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x6E5B7F4B
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x07198962
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
0x45D1717C

0x0F7B6850
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
0xF8F8B8F8

0x0F7B6850
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
0x81FB066C
quite a desolate spot."
0xF87BF6BC

0x0F7B6850
"Who is with him?"
0x562B4A19

0x0F7B6850
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
0x77144614
down, they say."
0x5EAEEC04

0x0F7B6850
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
0x27903DFB

0x0F7B6850
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
0x98BE0DBF

0x0F7B6850
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
0x7920C23A
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
0x5352318A
you usually demand."

CHAPTER XXXVII
0x6CE51704

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0xE234FF84
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xE175F247
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x3FE5414E
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0x3444EFEC
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x12271D87
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x512FD188
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x42C748C1
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0x8A82B534
there in the season to shoot.
0x6867B05A

0x0F7B6850
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0x285F8B29
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x0DC3B917
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x1D30EA9B
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x4E0851AE
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0xDF38ACA4
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0xCB8B7CA3
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x4AF74AC4
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0x465B5544
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x0E41D16E
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0xB7B8BB61
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0x2C7E6AFD
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x7A613640

0x0F7B6850
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x6962D02C
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x5BDC148E
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x3725AB47
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0xD2ADAD2D

0x0F7B6850
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x0B755AFA
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xC23425E8
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x709ED25F
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x4F90E35B
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x69F92FBC
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x894D6F56
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x37F6EC6C
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0xB4284CF6
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0x8AE101B2
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x1E3577A7
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0xF9EF8CD2
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0xCBA07485

0x0F7B6850
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xAB8EDC6A

0x0F7B6850
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0xB13842BB
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xA650C31F
grange.
0xE67A4C6A

0x0F7B6850
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0x296C08DB
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x9568F787
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0x4B5F33F8
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x46DEE07F

0x0F7B6850
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xE399854C
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x1F255BDE
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0xB308A1F4
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0xF781BB0E
advance.
0x16E474A8

0x0F7B6850
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xBC19E1A0
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x791AD601
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xDF35F8E4
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0xCA9C2204
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x557E23C6
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x63B7CA1D
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x07489DF4
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x4B5ADD10

0x0F7B6850
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0xFE37B852
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x37AE1A18
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x16504122
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x257EEC84

0x0F7B6850
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0x94B8FDEB
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x60C89E72
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0x27FDD08C
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0x3B65038B
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0xD9F7085B
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x8608CE67
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0xE7EED1D8
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0xBCD0073D
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x599A7E9E
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0x4D2437F2
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x7B272D27

0x0F7B6850
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xACC2948F
had you not better go in?"
0x537AA277

0x0F7B6850
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x94F771E4

0x0F7B6850
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x389DE2B9
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0x5F02F38B
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0xBC69A919

0x0F7B6850
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x67B10529
"how are you?"
0xC6E68B0E

0x0F7B6850
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x5D472747
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0xDBCE1F8D
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x1312477F
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x08C6C095
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x2895C0A9
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x6053A356
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0xE00720D1
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x999980CD
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x753BF169
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x5D1E3CD6
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0xB5A137E7
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0xFFD5B5FC

0x0F7B6850
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0x66D5CB0A
to him, but do not give my name."
0x2EF4A52B

0x0F7B6850
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xBE82E5FE

0x0F7B6850
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0xD3BAA1E8
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0xDD9A0BC5
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0xC805F9CD

0x0F7B6850
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0x9AEA34C4

0x0F7B6850
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x076BF9D2

0x0F7B6850
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0xDA2597D2

0x0F7B6850
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x42F49EE3
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x81D888C8
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0xF72F67BB

0x0F7B6850
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0xC2AE6F42
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0xD3C9C698
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x8AF3D9E5
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x32137F72
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x4064C33D
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x63F53AF5
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0x39F066E2
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x3E0B9B91
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0xF759EDE8
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0xFD6CC0BF

0x0F7B6850
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0x7AF2EFD8

0x0F7B6850
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x5611E85B
still excited.
0xBE580FC7

0x0F7B6850
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0xBBA7A06A

0x0F7B6850
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x44A29E71
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x223CFB71
you, Mary, is it not?"
0xB151EA45

0x0F7B6850
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x74BFACA7

0x0F7B6850
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0xB16BF268
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x814A184F
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x65C824D3
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x06FD693D
and aloud.
0xCC61BD1F

0x0F7B6850
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x9FE6244F
glass," I said.
0x03DF0FDB

0x0F7B6850
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0xA64C627B

0x0F7B6850
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x7E449F33
evening," I answered.
0x49E092E4

0x0F7B6850
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x34946D62
seized me?"
0xD2D90FDB

0x0F7B6850
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0xF9A9CDDB
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x36D51765

0x0F7B6850
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0xED4697D9
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0xC776C704
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0xF2642184

0x0F7B6850
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0xF3534543

0x0F7B6850
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x6620B0D7
must be more of her."
0x664D4177

0x0F7B6850
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xFD492EAE
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0x8AF9DAF7

0x0F7B6850
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0xE2802C67

0x0F7B6850
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0xFB32F5DD
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0xB1105471

0x0F7B6850
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x51C965BB

0x0F7B6850
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0x17814FF1
come back to you."
0xF612734F

0x0F7B6850
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xD8AF283E

0x0F7B6850
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x113B7FF9
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x30BE57DA

0x0F7B6850
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x91C418FD
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x742FE844
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xD838B44B
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0xBFC356D2
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x9CFA02A4

0x0F7B6850
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x47AEF9C7

0x0F7B6850
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0xB75F28DE
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0xC311A770
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0x454503EC
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0x2947B5D5
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x3AECF1CF
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0x0F0B801A

0x0F7B6850
"There, sir--and there!"'
0xDB6CB568

0x0F7B6850
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x363D3EB3
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xD1B78DB7
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x235DBD22

0x0F7B6850
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x43458007

0x0F7B6850
"I am."
0x7B05CCFC

0x0F7B6850
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0xDE916B14
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0xEF2B15D1

0x0F7B6850
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0x5586F9D0

0x0F7B6850
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0x9030B112

0x0F7B6850
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0xEF0AF79C

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0xF7688783
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0xB01E9612
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0xDA77DF3D
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0xD8AA4CE4

0x0F7B6850
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0xFF51683E
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0x0A7216DF
company of an evening."
0x30FCADC8

0x0F7B6850
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0x90EEC0AF
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0x80B86FC0
me?"
0x18A87D50

0x0F7B6850
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x2FA6A431
mistress."
0x654B351C

0x0F7B6850
"And you will stay with me?"
0x692854EF

0x0F7B6850
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0xEE37DCA4
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0x6D63ABC4
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0xDBE29E6B
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x3121556F
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0xC2F42A84

0x0F7B6850
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xD258782C
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0x10F296FE
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xDF3E1938
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x75BBEAEE
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x0C1011D8
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xC0EB5538
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x0D6DCF75
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x935B055A
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x366771E0
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x39C867A6
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x968EAB9F

0x0F7B6850
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0xF5044402
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x713C9340
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x4F80155A
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0x572F501C
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x92C74464
vengeance on its frame."
0xCA2D9D45

0x0F7B6850
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0x260F724B

0x0F7B6850
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0xCFC7AF75
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0xBD342737
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0xA2A90B17
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0xD9400B0B
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0x37B41860
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0xBAAF40B7
Come--tell me."
0x600E0F20

0x0F7B6850
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x6CD2139E
you think it better."
0xE5689072

0x0F7B6850
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x71E5FBCF
one day."
0xBC8875F3

0x0F7B6850
"I don't care about being married."
0x9CEAFE33

0x0F7B6850
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0xA24F69FC
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x3BC8E335

0x0F7B6850
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x18BE10AF
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0x71EB6BBE
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x04022167
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x0449A83E
conversation.
0x751CA546

0x0F7B6850
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0x42A46C8E
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x22933E77
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0xC35D84E0
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xDE2CCBDB
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x0C68FE3D
not yet noticed."
0x368A67FC

0x0F7B6850
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x9F713F55
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0x10C74DCF
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x00B265B2

0x0F7B6850
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x65D2C875
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x3EB506AB
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xC35F864D

0x0F7B6850
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0xC8D9A2E8
cicatrised visage."
0x5620A457

0x0F7B6850
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x87ABFC0D
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0xF68403D8
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0x999F2567

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x5A0B93A2

0x0F7B6850
"And you see the candles?"
0xAF7AB053

0x0F7B6850
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
0xEA395A22

0x0F7B6850
"Can you see me?"
0xCD93E83A

0x0F7B6850
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
0x7BCC8FDE

0x0F7B6850
"When do you take supper?"
0xD9992281

0x0F7B6850
"I never take supper."

"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0xBFFDB5C5
only you forget."
0xF85EF81D

0x0F7B6850
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x621E9AC8
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0x0FCE41DD
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x21C058D7
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0xAA3974FB
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0x1304E421
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x2975C477
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xEF0B8B9B
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x30C980AA
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xD7C795A6
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xC3C751B1

0x0F7B6850
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x7F40D8CC
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x817E0413
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x0928F76C
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x2ABA785B
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x2E56B661
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0xC2E3BC47
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0x066BFCB9

0x0F7B6850
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
0x29AFC3ED

0x0F7B6850
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
0x944E4346

0xC7F081D2

0x0F7B6850
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
0xA3CA3042

0x0F7B6850
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0x2505D377
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0xF145A55A
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0x00373345
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x997F2A0B

0x0F7B6850
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
0xFBBB236B

0x0F7B6850
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
0x4D27827A
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0xEE5F326B
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0xF8798106
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0x82EADA48
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x7D6BA9BB
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xA54F0CAE
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x16159D13
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x6055C20F
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0x911B3D88

0x0F7B6850
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x6BD7CC41
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x7503D23F
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xF3147488
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x2E659923
them grow as broad and black as ever.
0xC8FA8DF4

0x0F7B6850
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
0x2E68746F
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
0xC8DD9B60
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
0x71DCE4B7
undiscoverable?
0x0524FCA3

0x0F7B6850
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
0x4EE66522

0x0F7B6850
"What for, Jane?"
0xD08B69E9

0x0F7B6850
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
0xD5515559
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
0x331C0153
sure, you are more like a brownie."
0x0837D66C

0x0F7B6850
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
0x7E7A7D95

0x0F7B6850
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
0x198CEBA7

0x0F7B6850
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
0xAE9892E7
sojourned."
0x171588B8

0x0F7B6850
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
0xA0CD9B79
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
0x4BF8B04F
life: quite more refined and exalted."
0x842A977A

0x0F7B6850
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
0xC4461E78

0x0F7B6850
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
0xCBEE7358
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
0x30A8AE8A
substantiality."
0x15DE61A0

0x0F7B6850
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
0xCE2D0C4E

0x0F7B6850
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xC79C43FA
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0xBD674AEB
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x7836475F
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0xB4797A31
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0xEDF05E1D
ham."
0x3A85B2E2

0x0F7B6850
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0x97036FDB
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
0x02A8A311
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
0x4A1398D6
harp."
0x1DC24BD9

0x0F7B6850
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x601737F4
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0xC91941CC
night."
0x868C2FC1

0x0F7B6850
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x6460E7E8
been?"
0x3FF0A156

0x0F7B6850
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0x170721CB
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0xA015A8B3
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x49A2A685

0x0F7B6850
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x3468FA60
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x4DF51740
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0x053A6F3F
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0x6FC1B285

0x0F7B6850
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x57A87699
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x32069677
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x8B34275F
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x02680700
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x97DFC18E
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0xDB1656CA
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0xAF077E71
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x03818555
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x16A7324B
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x66908E19
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x1A21293C

0x0F7B6850
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x214436D4
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x8D698979
soon."
0xC9EAAEB0

0x0F7B6850
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0xC04240D4

0x0F7B6850
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0xD7ECA689
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xCE6E3FF3
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x54EF8FB4
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0xC3F84477
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x686C57BF
can feel is in her presence."
0x9EBF14AD

0x0F7B6850
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x60CC8119
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0xBD7BD9D9
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x55C0FFA8
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x4E5CD940

0x0F7B6850
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x0D42682E
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0xFB3D2E2C
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x07400F21
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x91EB22CE
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x74064C90
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xCB1994F7
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0xE4F9C98C
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0xA368FBAF

0x0F7B6850
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0xD976BA8E
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x348F93F7
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x21F58C49
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x0A66EA63
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x17D4712A
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x103177EC
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0xB8240332
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xDCD6ADD9

0x0F7B6850
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x5DFCB269
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x950C3E08
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x8F1198ED
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x9C8BEAD9
deeper than I wished.
0x725887DF

0x0F7B6850
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x2974D184
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x2F0378FE
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x12EFCE07
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x662E0833
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x9147CC48
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0xFCD71E56
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x0C01A30A
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x1ADE6F75

0x0F7B6850
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0x3790F7CC
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x58922B0D
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x2EC7FF76
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x54A8DB58
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xC5768E6F
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x49E52426
up.
0x30D103AF

0x0F7B6850
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0x131BBBB7

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0x00789841

0x0F7B6850
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0x9FE9CECB

0x0F7B6850
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x43282418
Or what does it mean?"
0x3CDB2659

0x0F7B6850
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0xD5854C08

0x0F7B6850
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0xFCE97EA8
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x8923798D
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0x1D273B14

0x0F7B6850
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0x94C08235
perform."
0xB8ECDC64

0x0F7B6850
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x718BB43B
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0xA77FB81F

0x0F7B6850
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0x112DE5D1
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0x66EF802F

0x0F7B6850
"Is he an able man, then?"
0x24C62519

0x0F7B6850
"Truly able."
0x4893BA07

0x0F7B6850
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0xFC1EB4AD

0x0F7B6850
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x9B1A18EC

0x0F7B6850
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0x08F34381
parsonic?"
0xBABB4591

0x0F7B6850
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0xB9291842
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x5025E189

0x0F7B6850
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x4BA02CEF
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0xCADE3F4A
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0xAE9664CC

0x0F7B6850
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0x15E56723
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0x6F63A8D7

0x0F7B6850
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0xEE008609

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0x547A95BB

0x0F7B6850
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x5C78E54C
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0xA881AAD5
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x9BAD4F7B
immediately charm the snake.
0x92D87E44

0x0F7B6850
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0xFB355146
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0xA1219F3C

0x0F7B6850
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0xD3F1D42E

0x0F7B6850
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xDBFC0390
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x845E4683
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x9A1424CE
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x346F6565
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0xEE89BAB9
bargain."
0xCD5837A0

0x0F7B6850
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0xE2A0EF99
sir."
0x6918BA2A

0x0F7B6850
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0x7F677A08
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0x0B269303
question or two."  He paused.
0x5E5CBBAD

0x0F7B6850
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0x9AE1A539

0x0F7B6850
Then followed this cross-examination.
0x807A3F2F

0x0F7B6850
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
0x46DD64C3
cousin?"
0x1ADC56E5

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
0x52A8A7F6

0x0F7B6850
"Daily."
0xA8C190A1

0x0F7B6850
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
0xC8C31B7B
you are a talented creature!"
0xE3B1B513

0x0F7B6850
"He approved of them--yes."
0x19951D79

0x0F7B6850
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
0x273D6992
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
0xFF54BAF9

0x0F7B6850
"I don't know about that."
0x6E338E51

0x0F7B6850
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
0x3D3A52B0
there to see you?"
0x55AE6916

0x0F7B6850
"Now and then?"
0xB2DEDE29

0x0F7B6850
"Of an evening?"
0x17836A3A

0x0F7B6850
"Once or twice."
0x495CA628

0x0F7B6850
A pause.
0xF7A5A3EB

0x0F7B6850
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
0x944A1D2A
was discovered?"
0x04BD41B8

0x0F7B6850
"Five months."
0xA2313A34

0x0F7B6850
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
0x722889E2

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
0xAC473D96
window, and we by the table."
0xA0434203

0x0F7B6850
"Did he study much?"
0x835E1B3F

0x0F7B6850
"A good deal."
0xB86B36BE

0x0F7B6850
"What?"
0x38A2F2D9

0x0F7B6850
"Hindostanee."
0xFE53D7A6

0x0F7B6850
"And what did you do meantime?"
0x9A5E7355

0x0F7B6850
"I learnt German, at first."
0x8E29ECB3

0x0F7B6850
"Did he teach you?"
0x8C4BD771

0x0F7B6850
"He did not understand German."
0xDAF70372

0x0F7B6850
"Did he teach you nothing?"
0xC4798A14

0x0F7B6850
"A little Hindostanee."
0x32FAA3F3

0x0F7B6850
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
0xD464E592

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"And his sisters also?"
0x57959D22

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"Only you?"
0xEACECF3A

0x0F7B6850
"Only me."
0xF48FB2EE

0x0F7B6850
"Did you ask to learn?"
0xA1417262

0x0F7B6850
"No."
0xAEE25662

0x0F7B6850
"He wished to teach you?"
0x8E8505F8

0x0F7B6850
"Yes."
0x40738CAA

0x0F7B6850
A second pause.
0xF951CF88

0x0F7B6850
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
0x11803061

0x0F7B6850
"He intended me to go with him to India."
0xCA468F53

0x0F7B6850
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
0x00DFF0E1

0x0F7B6850
"He asked me to marry him."
0x632C12CE

0x0F7B6850
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
0xC5EA94E2

0x0F7B6850
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0xA59F0E6F
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0x76A5CA46

0x0F7B6850
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
0x7337B822
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
0x532E8308
have given you notice to quit?"
0x53355524

0x0F7B6850
"Because I am comfortable there."
0x51B8DCE7

0x0F7B6850
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0xC058A21A
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0x5E7F6284
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xA3B724D0
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x1CE553A7
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0xB00267E7
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0x0EC7423D
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
0x31E35A2D

0x0F7B6850
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
0x57FD9676
accord."
0xDBFCDAA2

0x0F7B6850
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
0x1A1546A5
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
0x105E9346
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
0xA06126CA

0x0F7B6850
"Where must I go, sir?"
0x13D7627B

0x0F7B6850
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
0xA937340E

0x0F7B6850
"Who is that?"
0xF9D30A99

0x0F7B6850
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
0x89EDF92B

0x0F7B6850
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x8A02FAD7
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0xDD1CF09A
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x7D620698
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xC52B0C3D
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x6C8D9C36
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x0109AD36
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x6B67485B
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0xFD01B9F5
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xAF4B175A

0x0F7B6850
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x9A31C902
beloved master.  He smiled.
0x35FB5CDC

0x0F7B6850
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0x69B7EBD4
you and Rivers?"
0x3826166B

0x0F7B6850
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x9DA6229D
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0xEB6C5EF3
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0xC6C79A45
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0xDFA8A493
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xCB3E2C04
of me from your presence for ever."
0x683D9D26

0x0F7B6850
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0x34EFE1A2

0x0F7B6850
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x4E4F2F1B

0x0F7B6850
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0xEE118DB9
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x9DA74198
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0xE13A7C74
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0x22C8418C

0x0F7B6850
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xEE339966
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xDD7A5BDF
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0x4FF4D228

0x0F7B6850
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0x73A948E2
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0x7D128926
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0xEE385A8D
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x3C328FFB
offers them so safe a prop."
0xED2B40A5

0x0F7B6850
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x35247A29

0x0F7B6850
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0xC83A9252

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0xF296AF75
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0x580A3A62
helped me.
0x97117220

0x0F7B6850
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
0x4ECD7CBF

0x0F7B6850
"Do you, sir?"
0x338A1D37

0x0F7B6850
"Yes: is it news to you?"
0x31E0FBCC

0x0F7B6850
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
0x393F67BE

0x0F7B6850
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0x96746CB3

0x0F7B6850
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
0x39C0DA6B

0x0F7B6850
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
0xECBDE973

0x0F7B6850
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
0xC5A8AAD5

0x0F7B6850
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x8AA8E81B

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
0x33C97BEA

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
0x97B54C29
on?"
0x4E3E4C9F

0x0F7B6850
"Yes, sir."
0x4C65E59D

0x0F7B6850
"Truly, Jane?"
0x83EC160C

0x0F7B6850
"Most truly, sir."
0x357CB1FD

0x0F7B6850
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
0xAE628491

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
0x0AB32E26
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0xD13FDBEC
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
0xEB599C55
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
0x1000FFC7

0x0F7B6850
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
0x25D54B4D

0x0F7B6850
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
0x897FC9B2
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x741F5593
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0xAA963B32
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
0x3B87AB58

0x0F7B6850
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
0xD1D807F0

0x0F7B6850
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
0x78130CD2
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
0x1475A3C5
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
0x73C1C99B

0x0F7B6850
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
0xA1DECBFD
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
0x2ADA7F7A
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
0x8166A7E4
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
0x52E9F797
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
0x11E254D9
her?"
0x69DD4B87

0x0F7B6850
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
0x6BDB318E

0x0F7B6850
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
0x37FE3142
married instantly."
0x9ED71D32

0x0F7B6850
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
0x11F04579

0x0F7B6850
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
0x2E3E66D0
licence to get--then we marry."
0xEFCA16DA

0x0F7B6850
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
0x91987254
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
0x1FFEFEDE
your watch."
0x1B36D41D

0x0F7B6850
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
0xC811AD73
use for it."
0x1A481F50

0x0F7B6850
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
0x673B0DA6
hungry?"
0x0E1B83C9

0x0F7B6850
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
0x8AB7E5D9
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
0xB09B52C4

0x0F7B6850
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
0xAA97EBF6
is quite hot."
0xCF8992FC

0x0F7B6850
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
0xF09B98FA
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
0xC577D1EF
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
0x7B433BBB

0x0F7B6850
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
0xC3A9329E

0x0F7B6850
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
0xE587D039

0x0F7B6850
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0xB5263C80
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0xF0210553
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0x38E0BF43
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xC70A64BD
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x27F18945
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xA7D7F807
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0xE7BB5479
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xA71CAF25
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0xE6EEA706
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0x6562458A
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0xB1EBD1DB
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x68AB2A1D
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x4863ED0C
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0xB4FA891B
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0xC6F4C20D

0x0F7B6850
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0x1DED0B2E
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x67BCE057
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0xE3F2833A
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0x00FE4D0D
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x982CA0CE
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0x080B9CCE
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x4A3ADED9
rejoining Jane.
0xD59DC741

0x0F7B6850
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0x1D1FBF16
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0xC84E024F
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x6B2454A9
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0xD3CAF476
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x641977D8
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x50FB8CC0
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0x61C6988A
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0x311DE0C1
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0xA9755553
Jane!  Jane!'"
0x4D4D9E75

0x0F7B6850
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
0x648D6A50

0x0F7B6850
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0x64B01A5E
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
0xFC51EDFF

0x0F7B6850
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
0xF45967BB

0x0F7B6850
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x232381F9
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0x5F5AFF0F
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0xFA59EFCA
that I heard what I now relate.
0xEF888D79

0x0F7B6850
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0x761D1068
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0x28A4A9C0
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x149E7F91
are you?'
0xD209987E

0x0F7B6850
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x6A4BDA57
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xB9F4DE8D
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0x88A6150F
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0xE1A40073
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0xE6F62157
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x835DA3C0
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xA69979E4
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x4F8F02CB
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x4B0FF9D9
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0xAAE7674B

0x0F7B6850
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xAE79FC5A
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0x50E368E2
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xBD519455
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x6E0E9248
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xC17B0961
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0x04E9ABB8
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0x35721FB3
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x7258D17E
them in my heart.
0xB636C08A

0x0F7B6850
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xCEEE76BD
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0xB682EE51
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x6906EB5D
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0xC6824EA2
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0xF62932BE
God!"
0x537AF9D1

0x0F7B6850
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0xE98CF80C
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0xFBEE689C
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x0E2303DD

0x0F7B6850
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0xC70BF3D9
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0xEFD39320
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
0x6CDEF00D

0x0F7B6850
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x73AAD5F2
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x24083F1E
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x1350A645
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
0x95F6EF26

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0xEB4936B5

0x0F7B6850

0x0F7B6850
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0x2ABCC3FC
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0xBB572B29
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0xE9E45B53
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0x1FE80E93

0x0F7B6850
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xE3275981
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0xA1324BA6
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x3E233544
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x7B8BD427
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x52F577BC
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x905072C2
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x235A7950
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xF86D5F6B
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0xB59D3ADC
again over the roast, said only--
0xFBB105F9

0x0F7B6850
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0x25A09165

0x0F7B6850
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0xDFE02369
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x09CA06D7
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xBD4BBB66

0x0F7B6850
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0xF8926E4E
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0xF653AA35
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x5981F7F0
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x5E0407B1
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x4D9FC7D6
politely pulled his forelock.
0xBB6E6FA4

0x0F7B6850
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x710AB75A
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x7556D4EA
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xD81946AD
caught the words--
0xAFC68613

0x0F7B6850
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0xF3D63B04
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x0E90C970
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0xD970DE36

0x0F7B6850
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xE49D6654
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0xB54F911F
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x1768B713
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0x7FDD817E

0x0F7B6850
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0xA7FB5DF0
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0xED42E74A
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x779D9086
grave or mine."
0x45833FCB

0x0F7B6850
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x396743E2
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x54082C8C
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0xC7657D4C
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xB6E6190C
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x445D652B
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0xDB982EE3
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x6422BD9C

0x0F7B6850
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x2E94EDE9
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0xF880666A
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xF35E765E
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0xE18E2480
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0xDC18DBE9
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x08388B04
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x3841B845
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x0AEF0676
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0x11E35511
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x255127CE
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x61B17A7A
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0xA72A7058
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xFB1B89C0
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0xDC334179
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x36F5947B
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x72695B65
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x25B05BDC
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0xE4AF05B4

0x0F7B6850
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x020CB67D
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0x94E2DD9E
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x0907AE82

0x0F7B6850
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0xE8E3C7E1
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x34D25FA0
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x330DEA63
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0x258CB772
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0xD54BB41C
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x293ACCE0
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xAA37284E
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0x1506C03B
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x442C05D0
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0xE6819782
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x2CA5A5CA
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x337C60B6
concord is the result.
0x98FCE56B

0x0F7B6850
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0xCA1B3720
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x17938365
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0xE49FE417
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0x973B4CCF
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x567D806A
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0x937E21DE
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x1599476E
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0xC5918624
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0x95C3427E
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x14FEF0CB
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xF3198BE8
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x12B15683
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0xCC0BFB79
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x822E33CF
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0x00DFF434

0x0F7B6850
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x30078F80
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0xC7855B8C
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x506AD253

0x0F7B6850
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x1A0BDC29

0x0F7B6850
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0xC83A658A

0x0F7B6850
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0xE3695ACD

0x0F7B6850
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xB8B79BF2
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0xDF524587
sure of it.
0xA981FFC6

0x0F7B6850
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x5A845422
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x698FAA95
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x9E45D5D6
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x4D0CD774
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xC7721AFE
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xD9F6D606
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x5B40EA7C
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x9A49E168

0x0F7B6850
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x76A3DF05
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x5B468D85
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0xCEB26F88
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x357E3AC6
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0xDB9A534B
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x860F35FF
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0xD286500F

0x0F7B6850
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x8A58F699
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0xEF4D5435
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x0CA3FA9A
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x10E588BD
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x88774D5A
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0xF1717C76
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x15779FC0
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0xED0713A4
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0xC2B1E015
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0xAE07F8E1
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x40CD6878
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x3C6EF97E
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0xB572423F
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xC6FEA716
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0xB168728A

0x0F7B6850
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x903A63BE
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0xA0F4CF2D
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x6150021A
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0xA4333349
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0x991D5E7C
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0xAC4A2CE3
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x98A9C05F
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0xAEBB3140
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x55681C2F
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0xD6C2488B

0x0F7B6850
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x95FB28CD
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0x365F5A4D
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

0x8E846E61
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
0x351136E5
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
0x1F1C1AFA
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
0xDD212506
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
0x15D32BBA
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
0xF45F7076
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
0x78C9F0D5
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
0x4918175B
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
0xA7607D86
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
0xD71A2571
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
0x6A6B33AC
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
0x8F815FC7
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
0x18560382
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of

0x0F7B6850
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
0xBB06980F

0x0F7B6850
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
0x43C4F6F0
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
0x31BF5F93
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
0x5BB4CD42
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
0x2F37C6F9
people in all walks of life.
0xACCED5ED

0x0F7B6850
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
0xA780590C
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
0xA71E5400
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
0x7A88F374
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
0x1E3E53EA
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
0xE123CD2A
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
0x9F854211
Literary Archive Foundation
0x3176F9E3

0x0F7B6850
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
0xD31FE48E
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
0x69776AD3
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
0x27211CBB
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
0x5F4A7963
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
0xE2805C52
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
0x325E52FC
status with the IRS.
0x127F9AA6

0x0F7B6850
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
0x7F25C2A4
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
0xCDB98698
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
0x0747CF44
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
0xA332D9AD
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
0x5DD8E6D2
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
0xA7CD799F
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
0x1723269E
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
0xE28FF9BA

0x0F7B6850
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
0xC28A3711
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
0x30D548EF
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
0x8CA533AC
approach us with offers to donate.
0xF831C6AF

0x0F7B6850
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
0xCB7858FD
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
0x8B3A09F3
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

0x29354595
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
0xB83E533C

0x3424667E
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
0x25062E90

0x0F7B6850

0x060D7563
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
0x9BE70029
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
0x70432A84
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
